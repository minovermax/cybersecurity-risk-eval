{"cik": "1091748", "company": "Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common shares involves various risks, and you are urged to carefully consider all of the matters discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in considering our business and prospects. The following is a summary list of some of these risks:\n\u2022Insurance Underwriting Risks. Insurance underwriting risks include risks related to adverse changes in the value of insurance liabilities, including risks related to an excess or shortage of underwriting capacity, unexpected changes in the claims environment, changes to distribution channels, and sufficiency of reserves.\n\u2022Operational Risks. Operational risks include risks related to inadequate or failed internal operations, and include risks related to employee performance and retention, internal controls, information technology, failure to protect confidential information and outsourcing relationships.\n\u2022COVID-19 Risks. Risks related to COVID-19 could result in reduced demand for insurance policies, increased claims, and increased losses due to legislative, regulatory and judicial actions. COVID-19 could also impact the Company through its impact on financial markets, interest rates, decreased access to capital, and disruptions to operations due to the impact of COVID-19 on third parties.\n\u2022Market, Credit, Investment and Liquidity Risks. Market, credit, investment and liquidity risks include risks related to the performance of Argo\u2019s investment portfolio, and include risks related to the performance of financial markets, foreign currency fluctuations, economic and political conditions, and the availability of reinsurance.\n\u2022Strategic Risks. Strategic risks include risks related to Argo\u2019s inability to implement appropriate business plans and strategies, and include risks related to the macroeconomic environment, risked-based capital requirements, the Company\u2019s debt, holding company structure, ratings and strategic transactions.\n\u2022Reputational Risks. Reputational risks include risks related to the risk of potential loss through a deterioration of Argo\u2019s reputation, and include risks related to potential violations of sanctions, anti-corruption or AML regulations and activist shareholder actions.\n\u2022Regulatory and Litigation Risks. Regulatory and litigation risks include risks related to the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, regulatory constraints on Argo\u2019s business, including constraints imposed on our Bermuda, U.S., U.K., or other subsidiaries, and limitations on a potential change of control due to Argo\u2019s corporate structure.\n\u2022Taxation Risks. Taxation risks include risks related to the Company and its non-U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 potential exposure to U.S. federal income and withholding taxes, risks related to the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries being subject to increased tax liabilities, risks related to changes in U.S. federal income tax laws, risks related to U.S. equity security holders\u2019 potential exposure to U.S. federal income taxes on the Company\u2019s or its non-U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 undistributed earnings and profits or an increased U.S. federal income tax liability and interest charge on certain taxes deemed deferred due to our non-U.S. status, and risks related to potential exposure to U.K., and Bermuda taxes.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common shares. Investors should carefully consider these risks, along with the other information included in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common shares. There may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or that we currently consider immaterial. All of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or value of our common shares.\nInsurance Underwriting Risks\nInsurance underwriting risks are defined as the risk of loss, or adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities, due to inadequate pricing and/or reserving practices. These risks may be caused by the fluctuations in timing, frequency and severity of insured events and claim settlements in comparison to the expectations at the time of underwriting.\nThe insurance business is historically cyclical, and we may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates; conversely, we may have a shortage of underwriting capacity when premium rates are strong, both of which could adversely impact our results.\nHistorically, insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency and severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, adverse trends in litigation, regulatory constraints, general economic conditions and other factors. The supply of insurance is related to prevailing prices, the level of insured losses and the level of capital available to the industry that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance industry. As a result, the insurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity increased premium levels. Demand for reinsurance depends on numerous factors, including the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, introduction of new capital providers, general economic conditions and underwriting results of primary insurers. The supply of reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, recent loss experience and capital levels. All of these factors fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the reinsurance industry.\nWe cannot predict with certainty whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our ability to underwrite insurance at rates that we consider appropriate and commensurate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot underwrite insurance at appropriate rates, our ability to transact business would be materially and adversely affected. Any of these factors could lead to an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe may incur income statement charges if the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are insufficient (or redundant). Such income statement charges could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to our financial condition and operating results in future periods.\nGeneral Loss Reserves\nWe maintain reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses to cover estimated ultimate unpaid liabilities with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each balance sheet date. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management\u2019s best estimates, which take into account various statistical and actuarial projection techniques as well as other influencing factors. Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic and social inflation, legal precedent and legislative changes. In addition, many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. Although reserve estimates are continually reevaluated in a regular ongoing process, because the calculation and setting of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process dependent on estimates, our existing reserves may be insufficient or redundant and estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses may increase or decrease over time.\nAsbestos and Environmental Liability Loss Reserves\nIn addition to the previously described general uncertainties encountered in estimating reserves, there are significant additional uncertainties in estimating the amount of our potential losses from asbestos and environmental claims. Reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year development factors due to the uncertainties surrounding these types of claims.\nAmong the uncertainties impacting the estimation of such losses are:\n\u2022difficulty in identifying sources of or exposure to environmental or asbestos contamination;\n\u2022uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure;\n\u2022changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of asbestos-related laws, including with respect to the interpretation and application of insurance coverage; and\n\u2022difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for environmental or asbestos damage.\nAlthough we have established reserves to account for our exposure to asbestos and related environmental liability claims, management believes these factors continue to render traditional actuarial methods less effective at estimating reserves for asbestos and environmental losses than reserves on other types of losses. In addition, there is no assurance that future adverse development will not occur, and such development may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBlack Lung Disease Loss Reserves\nThrough workers compensation coverage provided to coal mining operations by our subsidiary Rockwood, we have exposure to claims for black lung disease. Those diagnosed with black lung disease are eligible to receive workers compensation benefits from various U.S. federal and state programs. These programs are continually being reviewed by the governing bodies and may be revised without notice in such a way as to increase our level of exposure.\nAs described above, estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses may increase in the future. Such changes in estimates could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to our future operating results and financial condition. We can provide no assurances such capital will be available.\nAdditional information relating to our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense is included under Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 8, \u201cReserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and no assurance can be given that we will continue to be able to compete effectively in this environment.\nWe compete with numerous companies that provide property, casualty and specialty lines of insurance and related services. Some of those companies have a larger capital base and are more highly rated than we are. No assurance can be given that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the insurance market. Increased competition in these markets could result in a change in the supply and/or demand for insurance, affect our ability to price our products at risk-adequate rates and retain existing business or underwrite new business on favorable terms. If this increased competition limits our ability to transact business, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur insurance subsidiaries have exposure to unpredictable and unexpected changes in the claims environment or catastrophes and terrorist acts that can materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nEmerging Claims\nChanges in industry practices and legal, judicial, social, technological and other environmental conditions may have an unforeseeable adverse impact on claims and coverage issues. These issues may adversely affect our business, such as by extending coverage beyond the intended scope at the time of underwriting business or increasing the number or size of expected claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after insurance contracts that are affected were issued and hence cannot be appropriately factored into the underwriting decision. As a result, the full extent of liability under such insurance contracts may not be known for many years after these contracts have been issued, and our financial position and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected in such future periods. We maintain an emerging risk identification, analysis and reporting process, overseen by our Emerging Risk Review Group, as part of our enterprise risk framework, which seeks to provide an early identification of such trends. The effects of these and other unforeseen evolving or emerging claims and coverage issues are inherently difficult to predict.\nCatastrophic Losses\nWe are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including tornadoes, hurricanes, windstorms, tsunamis, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, power outages, severe winter weather, wildfires and man-made events, including civil unrest. The incidence and severity of such catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable, and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial. Insurance companies are generally not permitted to reserve for probable catastrophic events until they occur. Therefore, although we will actively manage our risk exposure to catastrophes through underwriting limits and processes, and further mitigate it through the purchase of reinsurance protection and other hedging instruments, an especially severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes could exceed our reinsurance or hedging protection and may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nTerrorism\nWe are exposed to the risk of losses resulting from acts of terrorism. Reinsurers are able to exclude coverage for terrorist acts or price that coverage at rates that we consider attractive. However, direct insurers, like our primary insurance company subsidiaries, might not be able to likewise exclude coverage of terrorist acts because of regulatory constraints. Terrorism exclusions are not permitted in the U.S. for worker\u2019s compensation policies under U.S. federal law or under the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which we operate. When underwriting existing and new workers compensation business, we consider the added potential risk of loss due to terrorist activity, including foreign and domestic, and this may lead us to decline to underwrite or to renew certain business. However, even in lines where terrorism exclusions are permitted, our clients may object to a terrorism exclusion in connection with business that we may still desire to underwrite without an exclusion, some or many of our insurance policies may not include a terrorism exclusion. Given the reinsurance retention limits imposed under the TRIA and its subsequent legislative extensions, and that some or many of our policies may not include a terrorism exclusion, future foreign or domestic terrorist attacks may result in losses that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation\u201d for a description of the applicability of the TRIA and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014 to the Argo Group of Companies and its U.S. operations.\nIn the event coverage of terrorist acts cannot be excluded, we, in our capacity as a primary insurer, would have a significant gap in our own reinsurance protection with respect to potential losses as a result of any terrorist act. It is impossible to predict the occurrence of such events with statistical certainty and difficult to estimate the amount of loss per occurrence they will generate. If there is a future terrorist attack, the possibility exists that losses resulting from such event could prove to be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist acts may also cause multiple claims, and there is no assurance that our attempts to limit our liability through contractual policy provisions will be effective.\nGlobal climate change may have an adverse effect on our financial results and operations.\nClimate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, including increases in severe weather and catastrophic events. Many sectors to which we provide insurance coverage, such as coastal management, infrastructure, buildings, water, food and energy supply, land-planning, health and rescue preparedness, might be affected by climate change. Although we have developed tailored solutions to account for emerging climate change risk, we recognize that there is considerable uncertainty in climate change, and we are unable to explicitly isolate the effect of climate change in order to quantify its effect on losses.\nAs a result, assessing the risk of loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change on our operations and/or financial condition remains challenging.\nBecause our business is dependent upon insurance and reinsurance agents and brokers, we are exposed to certain risks arising out of distribution channels that could cause our results to be adversely affected.\nWe market and distribute some of our insurance products and services through a select group of wholesale agents who have limited quoting and binding authority and who, in turn, sell our insurance products to insureds through retail insurance brokers. These agencies can bind certain risks that meet our pre-established guidelines. If these agents fail to comply with our underwriting guidelines and the terms of their appointment, we could be bound on a particular risk or number of risks, that were not anticipated, when we developed the insurance products. Such actions could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, in any given period, we may derive a significant portion of our business from a limited number of agents and brokers and the loss of any of these relationships, or significant changes in distribution channels resulting in loss of access to market through those agents and brokers, could have a significant impact on our ability to market our products and services.\nIn accordance with industry practice, we may pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers and/or third-party administrators who in turn remit these amounts to our insureds or reinsureds. Although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, in some jurisdictions in which we conduct business, if an agent or broker fails to remit funds delivered for the payment of claims, we may remain liable to our insured or reinsured ceding insurer for the deficiency. Likewise, in certain jurisdictions, when the insured or reinsured pays the remitting funds to our agent or broker in full, our premiums are considered to have been paid in full, notwithstanding that we may or may not have actually received the premiums from the agent or broker. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with certain agents and brokers with whom we transact business.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk refers to the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or the operational impact of external events. This risk encompasses all exposures faced by functions and services rendered in the course of conducting business including, but not limited to, underwriting, accounting and financial reporting, business continuity, claims management, information technology and data processing, legal and regulatory compliance, outsourcing and reinsurance purchasing.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, including revenues, profitability, results of operations, and/or cash flows, in a manner and to a degree that cannot be predicted but could be material.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in significant disruptions in economic activity and financial markets. COVID-19 has directly and indirectly adversely affected the Company and may continue to do so for an uncertain period of time. The cumulative effects of COVID-19 on the Company cannot be fully predicted at this time, but could include, without limitation:\n\u2022Reduced demand for our insurance policies due to reduced economic activity which could negatively impact our revenues;\n\u2022Reduced cash flows from our policyholders delaying premium payments;\n\u2022Increased claims, losses, litigation, and related expenses;\n\u2022Increased losses due to legislative, regulatory and judicial actions in response to COVID-19, including, but not limited to, actions prohibiting us from cancelling insurance policies in accordance with our policy terms, requiring us to cover losses when our policies did not provide coverage or excluded coverage, ordering us to provide premium refunds, granting extended grace periods for payment of premiums, and providing for extended periods of time to pay past due premiums;\n\u2022An increase in the demand and frequency of reporting by regulators that could place stress on our ability to accurately and timely meet those and existing demands, and a delay or denial in regulatory rate approvals could contribute to financial stress;\n\u2022An increase in claims as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022A negative impact on our ability to timely and properly pay claims and establish reserves due to uncertainty around claims patterns, including impediments to adjusting claims in the field;\n\u2022Volatility and declines in financial markets which, in response to COVID-19, has reduced, and could continue to reduce, the fair market value of, or result in the impairment of, invested assets held by the Company;\n\u2022An increase in loss costs and, as such, the need to strengthen reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses due to higher than anticipated inflation as a result of recent actions taken by the federal government and the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022Decline in interest rates which could reduce future investment results;\n\u2022Erosion of capital and an increase in the cost of reinsurance as well as an increase in counterparty credit risk;\n\u2022Decreased access to capital, if needed, and the cost of external capital could be elevated;\n\u2022Disruptions in our operations due to difficulties experienced by our partners and outsourced providers that may, among other items, adversely impact our ability to manage claims;\n\u2022Increased costs of operations due to the remote working environments of our employees; and\n\u2022Increased vulnerability to cyberthreats or other disruption in our operations while most of our workforce is continuing to work remotely.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business will depend on future developments, including the widespread availability of vaccines, and actual results in future periods could materially differ from our assumptions. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees and key executives.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent, skilled employees and seasoned key executives who are knowledgeable about our business. The pool of highly skilled employees available to fill our key positions may fluctuate based on market dynamics specific to our industry and overall economic conditions. As such, higher demand for internal leaders and employees having desired talents could lead to increased compensation expectations for existing and prospective personnel, making it difficult for us to recruit and retain key employees and/or maintain labor costs at desired operating levels. If we are unable to attract and retain such talented team members and leaders, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new markets, which could adversely affect our results.\nArgo Group and its subsidiaries, Argo Re and Argo Insurance Services Bermuda, Ltd., acting on behalf of Syndicate 1200, have operations that require highly skilled personnel to work in Bermuda. The ability to fill certain highly skilled key positions in Bermuda is constrained by Bermuda law, which provides that non-Bermudians are not permitted to engage in any occupation in Bermuda without an approved work permit from the Bermuda Department of Immigration. If the Bermuda Department of Immigration changes its current policies with respect to work permits, and as a result these key employees are unable to work in Bermuda, our operations could be disrupted and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, offices in foreign jurisdictions, such as Dubai, Singapore, Bermuda, U.K., Malta, Switzerland and Brazil, may have residency and other mandatory requirements that affect the composition of its local boards of directors, executive teams and choice of third-party service providers. Due to the competition for available talent in such jurisdictions, we may not be able to attract and retain personnel as required by our business plans, which could disrupt operations and adversely affect our financial performance.\nLoss of our executive officers or other key personnel or other changes to our management team could disrupt our operations or harm our business.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officers or other key positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nLeadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business, including to our relationships with our customers and employees.\nOur strategies and processes to mitigate insurance risk may fail and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe use a number of strategies and processes to mitigate our insurance risk exposure including:\n\u25aaengaging in disciplined and rigorous underwriting within clearly defined risk parameters and subject to various levels of oversight by experienced underwriting professionals;\n\u25aaundertaking technical analysis to inform pricing decisions\n\u25aacarefully evaluating terms and conditions of our policies;\n\u25aafocusing on our risk aggregations by geographic zones, industry type, credit exposure and other bases; and\n\u25aaceding insurance risk to reinsurance companies.\nHowever, there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of these strategies and processes. No assurance can be given that a failure to maintain or follow such processes or controls, an unanticipated event or series of such events will not result in loss levels that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur internal controls may fail and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe continually enhance our operating procedures and internal controls to effectively support our business and comply with our regulatory and financial reporting requirements. We are currently in the process of remediating a material weakness in our internal controls, as further described in Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control objectives have been or will be met or that instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Limitations include human error, intentional circumvention of controls, and false assumptions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. As a result of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, and although our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective, a misstatement due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe are dependent on our information technology systems which could fail or suffer a cybersecurity breach, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition or result in the loss of sensitive information.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer and data processing systems for various purposes, including accounting, policy administration, actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting business, and claims and payment processing. Certain of our operations are also dependent upon systems operated by third parties, including administrators, market counterparties and their sub-custodians and other service providers, and our service providers may also depend on information technology systems. Notwithstanding the diligence that we perform on our service providers, we may not be in a position to verify the risks or reliability of such information technology systems.\nWhile we have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach to date, we have no assurance that a breach associated with hacking, computer viruses, data breaches or ransomware attacks will not occur in the future. Incidents of publicly reported cyber security incidents have increased recently and the insurance sector as a whole is more exposed than in the past. Over time, and particularly recently, the sophistication of these threats have continued to increase. Although we have implemented multiple layers of protection to minimize the risks to systems, personal data and the privacy of individuals, including robust training, review, and audit procedures, there is no assurance that our security measures, including information security policies, will provide fully effective protection from such events.\nThe potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include disruption to business operations, a loss of confidential information, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, and remediation costs, which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition. While we continue to maintain and review our cyber liability insurance protection, providing for first party and third party losses, such insurance may not provide insurance coverage for all of the costs and damages associated with the consequences of a cybersecurity incident. In some cases, such unauthorized access may not be immediately detected. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nAny failure to protect the confidential customer information that we handle routinely could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a number of data privacy laws and regulations enacted in the jurisdictions in which we do business. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation\u201d for a description of the applicability of cyber and data regulations and requirements on the Argo Group.\nWe have not experienced a material privacy breach to date, and specifically no material events involving Personally Identifiable Information (\u201cPII\u201d) or customer information, but we have no assurance that a breach will not occur in the future. A misuse or mishandling of personal information being sent to or received from a client, employee or third party could damage our businesses or our reputation or result in significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. We routinely transmit, receive and store certain types of personal information by email and other electronic means. Although we attempt to protect this personal information, and have implemented robust privacy procedures and training programs to mitigate the risk of a privacy breach, we may be unable to protect personal information in all cases, especially with customers, business partners and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect personal information.\nThe potential consequences of a material privacy incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, and remediation costs, which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition. While we continue to maintain and review our cyber liability insurance protection, such insurance may not provide insurance coverage for all of the costs and damages associated with the consequences of personal information being compromised.\nWe may experience issues with outsourcing relationships which might impact our ability to conduct business in a prudent manner and could negatively impact our operations, results and financial condition.\nWe continue to outsource a number of technology and business process functions to third-party providers. We may continue to do so in the future as we review the effectiveness of our organization. If we do not effectively select, develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing relationships, or if we experience technological or other issues with transition, or if third-party providers do not perform as anticipated, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that may have an adverse effect upon on our operations or financial condition.\nWe periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. If such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition to a third-party provider, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations), a loss of business and increased costs, or suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security, which could result in adverse monetary, reputational and/or regulatory consequences, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. If we do not effectively monitor these relationships, third party providers do not perform as anticipated, technological or other problems occur with an outsourcing relationship we may not realize expected productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties. In addition, our ability to receive services from third-party providers based in different countries might be impacted by political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies inside or outside of the U.S. As a result, our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected.\nMarket, Credit, Investment and Liquidity Risk\nThe performance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of risks, including market risk, credit risk, investment risk and liquidity risk. Market risk is the risk of loss or adverse change in our financial position due to fluctuations in the level and volatility of market prices of assets, liabilities and financial instruments. This risk may be caused by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity, property and securities values.\nCredit risk is the risk of loss or adverse change in our financial position due to fluctuations in the credit standing of issuers of securities, counterparties or any other debtors, including risk of loss arising from an insurer\u2019s inability to collect funds from debtors.\nInvestment risk is the uncertainty associated with making an investment that may not yield the expected returns or performance, including the risk that an investment will decline in value, result in a loss or result in liability or other adverse consequences for the investor.\nLiquidity risk is the risk of loss or our inability to realize investments and other assets in order to meet our financial obligations when they fall due or the inability to meet such obligations except at excessive cost.\nInvestment guideline restrictions have been established in an effort to minimize the effect of these risks but may not always be effective due to factors beyond our control. For example, a significant change in interest rates could result in losses, realized or unrealized, in the value of our investment portfolio. Additionally, with respect to some of our investments, we are subject to prepayment and possibly reinvestment risk. Certain investments outside our highly rated fixed income portfolio, including high yield fixed maturity securities, equities and other alternative investments are subject to restrictions on sale, transfer and redemption, which may limit our ability to withdraw funds or realize gains on such investments for some period of time after our initial investment. The values of, and returns on, such investments may also be more volatile.\nIn an effort to meet business needs and mitigate risks, our investment guidelines provide restrictions on our portfolio\u2019s composition, including issuer limits, sector limits, credit quality limits, portfolio duration, limits on the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types. Our investment managers may invest some of the investment portfolio in currencies other than the U.S. dollar based on where our business is underwritten, the currency in which our loss reserves are denominated, regulatory requirements, or our managers\u2019 point of view on a given currency. As such, there can be no assurance that changes in currency values will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nA prolonged recession or a period of significant turmoil in the U.S. and international financial markets, could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition and our share price.\nU.S. and international financial market disruptions such as the ones experienced in the last global financial crisis and the volatility experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the possibility of a prolonged recession, may potentially affect various aspects of our business, including the demand for and claims made under our products, our counterparty credit risk and the ability of our customers, counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us, our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources and our investment performance. Volatility in the U.S. and other securities markets may also adversely affect our share price. Depending on future market conditions, we could incur substantial realized and unrealized losses in future periods, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, debt and financial strength ratings, insurance subsidiaries\u2019 capital levels and our ability to access capital markets.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in economic and political conditions, including inflation and changes in interest rates.\nThe effects of inflation could cause the cost of claims to rise in the future. Our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses (\u201cLAE\u201d) includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. To the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims, we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Furthermore, if we experience deflation or a lack of inflation going forward and interest rates remain very low or continue to decline, we could experience low portfolio returns because we hold fixed income investments of fairly short duration.\nAdditionally, our operating results are affected, in part, by the performance of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by inflation or changes in interest rates. Such adverse effects include the potential for realized and unrealized losses in a rising interest rate environment or the loss of income in an environment of prolonged low interest rates. Such effects may be further impacted by decisions made regarding such things as portfolio composition and duration given the prevailing market environment. Although we attempt to take measures to manage the risks of investing in changing interest rate environments, we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively. Fluctuation in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to significant market and credit risks which could result in an adverse impact on our financial position or results.\nAlthough our investment policies stress diversification of risks, conservation of principal and liquidity, our investments are subject to general economic conditions and market risks as well as risks inherent to particular securities.\nFor example, to the extent there is an economic downturn affecting a certain area in which our investment portfolio is concentrated, the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired would increase. Such defaults and impairments could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, increasing the risk that the fair value of certain of our investments may not be readily determinable.\nOur investments in fixed maturity and short-term securities may be adversely affected by changes in inflation and/or interest rates which, in turn, may adversely affect operating results. The fair value and investment income of these assets fluctuate with general economic and market conditions. Generally, the fair value of fixed maturity securities will decrease as interest rates increase. Some fixed maturity securities have call or prepayment options, which represent possible reinvestment risk in declining rate environments. Other fixed maturity securities such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities carry prepayment risk.\nWe also invest in marketable equity securities. These securities are carried on our balance sheet at fair value and are subject to potential losses and declines in market value. Our invested assets also include investments in limited partnerships, privately held securities and other alternative investments. Such investments entail substantial risks.\nRisks for all types of securities are managed through application of the investment policy, which establishes investment parameters that include, but are not limited to, maximum percentages of investment in certain types of securities, minimum levels of credit quality and option-adjusted duration guidelines. There is no guarantee of policy effectiveness.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that our investment objectives will be achieved, and results may vary substantially over time. Although we seek investment strategies that are correlated with our insurance and reinsurance exposures, losses in our investment portfolio may occur at the same time as underwriting losses and, therefore, exacerbate such losses\u2019 adverse effect on us. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Investments.\u201d\nWe may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations.\nAlthough our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, with the exception of our Brazilian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Brazilian Real, and our Maltese and Italian subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Euro, certain premium receivables and loss reserves include business denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. We are exposed to the possibility of significant claims in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. We may, from time to time, experience losses in the form of increased claims costs or devaluation of assets available for paying claims resulting from fluctuations in these non-U.S. currencies, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may be adversely affected by the banking industry transition away from London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d).\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after June 2023. LIBOR offers a benchmark which international banks use to lend to each other on short-term basis and has been used in a variety of other contracts including swaps, corporate debt and commercial contracts. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the U.K. or elsewhere. In addition, there can be no assurance that the alternative rates and fallbacks will be effective at preventing or mitigating disruption as a result of the transition. In the U.S., efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018.\nWe recognize that we have some risk exposure to the LIBOR transition within our investment portfolio and corporate debt structures. Having completed a structured evaluation, we believe our exposure to be minimal. We ensure that all securitized assets acquired since the transition was announced have LIBOR succession language and that alternative rates are adopted in contracts as these become established. Despite these measures, there remains the possibility that certain legacy instruments without these provisions could be adversely impacted during the transition.\nWe face a risk of non-availability of reinsurance, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe purchase reinsurance for our own account in order to mitigate the effect of certain large and multiple losses upon our financial condition. Our reinsurers or capital market counterparts are dependent on their ratings in order to continue to write business and some have suffered downgrades in ratings in the past as a result of their exposures. Our reinsurers or capital market counterparties may also be affected by adverse developments in the financial markets, which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. Insolvency of these counterparties, their inability to continue to write business or reluctance to make timely payments under the terms of their agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on us because we remain liable to our insureds or cedants in respect of the reinsured risks.\nAs is common practice within the insurance industry, we transfer a portion of the risks insured under our policies to other companies through the purchase of reinsurance or other, similar risk-mitigating hedging instruments. This reinsurance is maintained to protect the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims, unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss and catastrophic events. Although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay for losses insured under the policies they issue, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk.\nOur financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by the failure of one or more reinsurers or capital market counterparties to meet their payment obligations to us\nWe are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts. The collectability of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation and application of contract language and other factors. We are selective in regard to our reinsurers, placing reinsurance with those reinsurers with strong financial strength ratings from A.M. Best, S&P or a combination thereof. Despite strong ratings, the financial condition of a reinsurer may change based on market conditions. In certain instances we also require assets in trust, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due, however, there is no certainty that we can collect on these collateral agreements in the event of a reinsurers default. It is not always standard business practice to require security for balances due; therefore, certain balances are not collateralized. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nStrategic Risk\nStrategic risk means the risk of our inability to implement appropriate business plans and strategies, make decisions, allocate resources or adapt to changes in the business environment. Strategic risk includes the risk of the current or prospective adverse impact on earnings or capital arising from business decisions, improper execution of decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry changes.\nDeterioration of the macroeconomic environment in the U.S., Eurozone and worldwide\nEconomic imbalances and financial market turmoil could result in a widening of credit spreads and volatility in share prices. These circumstances could lead to a decline in asset value and potentially reduce the demand for insurance due to limited economic growth prospects. The ultimate impact of such conditions on the insurance industry in general, and on our operations in particular, cannot be fully or accurately quantified. Major public health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other event that causes a large number of illnesses or deaths, could harm our operations and have a major impact on the global economy and financial markets.\nAdverse developments in the broader economy could create significant challenges to the insurance industry. If policy responses in Europe, the U.S. and internationally are not effective in mitigating these conditions, the insurance sector could be adversely affected by the resulting financial and economic environment.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union may cause volatility in foreign exchange rates and regulatory uncertainty that may adversely impact our business.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, the British government has negotiated and executed the exit which occurred on January 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the E.U. announced that they had struck a new bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. (the \u201cE.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d) which was formally approved by the 27 member states of the E.U. on December 29, 2020. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was formally approved by the U.K. parliament on December 30, 2020 and is being applied provisionally until it is formally ratified by the E.U. parliament.\nThe E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides some clarity regarding the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. including some detailed matters of trade and cooperation, but there remain uncertainties related to Brexit and the new relationship between the U.K. and E.U. that will continue to be developed and defined, as well as uncertainties related to the wider trading, legal, regulatory, tax and labor environments, and the resulting impact on our business and that of our customer. Because we have significant operations in Europe, any of these uncertainties could increase our costs of doing business, or in some cases, affect our ability to do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBrexit may continue to cause regulatory and foreign exchange rate uncertainty with respect to ArgoGlobal Syndicate 1200. The Corporation of Lloyd\u2019s has acted on behalf of the market as a whole in establishing Lloyd\u2019s Insurance Company S.A., an insurance company operation in Belgium regulated by the National Bank of Belgium. ArgoGlobal\u2019s Syndicate 1200 has chosen to utilize this platform to maintain continuity of operations for their E.U.-domiciled clients.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital and solvency requirements in their respective regulatory domiciles.\nA risk-based capital system is designed to measure whether the amount of available capital is adequate to support the inherent specific risks of each insurer. Risk-based regulatory capital is calculated at least annually. Authorities use the risk-based capital formula to identify insurance companies that may be undercapitalized and thus may require further regulatory attention. The formulas prescribe a series of risk measurements to determine a minimum capital amount for an insurance company, based on the profile of the individual company. The ratio of a company\u2019s actual policyholder surplus to its minimum capital requirements will determine whether any regulatory action is required based on the respective local thresholds. The application and methods of calculating risk-based regulatory capital are subject to change, and the ultimate impact on our solvency position from any future material changes cannot be determined at this time.\nWhereas the majority of our operations operate on the basis of \u2018standard formula\u2019 risk-based capital systems, the Argo Lloyd\u2019s Platform consisting of S1200 has secured approval from Lloyd\u2019s for the use of customized Economic Capital Models, known as the Internal Models. These models are used to calculate regulatory capital requirements based on each Syndicate\u2019s unique risk profile. The Internal Models have been subject to extensive internal and external scrutiny including independent validation activities. The use of any complex mathematical model however exposes the organization to the risk that these models are not built correctly, contain coding or formulaic errors or rely on unreliable or inadequate data.\nAs a result of these and other requirements, we may have future capital requirements that may not be available to us on commercially favorable terms. Regulatory capital and solvency requirements for our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to underwrite new business, risk propensity and ability to establish premium rates and accurately set reserves at levels adequate to cover expected losses. To the extent that the funds generated by insurance premiums received and sale proceeds and income from our investment portfolio are insufficient to fund future operating requirements and cover incurred losses and loss expenses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce in size. Uncertainty in the equity and fixed maturity securities markets could affect our ability to raise additional capital in the public or private markets. Any future financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and our shareholders. In the case of equity financing, dilution to current shareholdings could result, and the securities issued may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our common shares.\nFailure to comply with the capital requirement laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions where we operate, including the U.S., the E.U., the U.K. or Bermuda could result in administrative penalties imposed by a particular governmental or self-regulatory authority, unanticipated costs associated with remedying such failure or other claims, harm to our reputation, or interruption of our operations, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. See \u201cItem 1. Business--Regulation.\u201d\nRestrictions on Dividends and Distributions\nArgo Re is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is in breach of its ECR, general business solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividends would cause such a breach. If it has failed to meet its minimum margin of solvency or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, Argo Re will be prohibited, without the approval of the BMA, from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year. In addition, Argo Re is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year\u2019s statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least 7 days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins.\nAs discussed in the regulatory section above, Argo Group and its various subsidiaries are considered to be an affiliated group for purposes of the BMA\u2019s Group Supervision regime. This Group Supervision regime stipulates solvency margins, capital requirements and eligible capital requirements at the consolidated Argo Group level that may affect the calculation of similar solvency and capital requirements at the Argo Re level. The methodology for applying these solvency and capital requirements, particularly in regard to the eligibility, and classification of certain capital instruments within an affiliated group, is subject to ongoing refinement and interpretation by the BMA. The applicable rules and regulations for this regime, and the manner in which they will be applied to Argo Group, are subject to change, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate impact of future changes on Argo Group\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness.\nWe may seek to incur additional indebtedness either through the issuance of public or private debt or through bank or other financing. The funds raised by the incurrence of such additional indebtedness may be used to repay existing indebtedness, including amounts borrowed under our credit facility, outstanding subordinated debt and floating rate loan stock or for our general corporate purposes, including additions to working capital, capital expenditures, investments in subsidiaries or acquisitions.\nThis additional indebtedness, particularly if not used to repay existing indebtedness, could limit our financial and operating flexibility, including as a result of the need to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flows from operations to interest and principal payments. It may also be more difficult for us to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns.\nOur holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints affect our ability to pay dividends and make other payments.\nArgo Group is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Argo Group\u2019s only significant assets are the capital stock of its subsidiaries. Because substantially all of our operations are conducted through our insurance subsidiaries, substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries and most of our cash flow, and consequently, our ability to meet our ongoing cash requirements, including any debt service payments or other expenses, and pay dividends to our shareholders, is dependent on the earnings of those subsidiaries and the transfer of funds by those subsidiaries to us in the form of distributions or loans.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause us to fail to comply, with applicable laws, rules and regulations (including any applicable capital adequacy guidelines established by the BMA) we may not declare, pay or set aside for payment dividends. As a result, if payment of dividends would cause us to fail to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation, we will not declare or pay a dividend, including dividends on our Preference Shares for such dividend period. In addition, the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make distributions to us is limited by applicable insurance laws and regulations. These laws and regulations and the determinations by the regulators implementing them may significantly restrict such distributions, and, as a result, adversely affect our overall liquidity. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may also be restricted by, among other things, other applicable laws and regulations and the terms of our bank loans and our subsidiaries\u2019 bank loans.\nWe have experienced a ratings downgrade in 2020 and there can be no assurance that we and our subsidiaries will not experience any further downgrades, which may result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRatings with respect to claims paying ability and financial strength are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and will also impact the cost and availability of capital to an insurance company. Ratings by A.M. Best and S&P represent an important consideration in maintaining customer confidence in us and in our ability to market insurance products. Rating organizations regularly analyze the financial performance and condition of insurers.\nOn February 26, 2020, A.M. Best downgraded the Company\u2019s financial strength rating (FSR) from \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) to \u201cA-\u201d (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) to \u201ca-\u201d from \u201ca\u201d of Argo Re and its subsidiaries. The outlook assigned to all these ratings by A.M. Best is negative. Argo Group and its insurance subsidiaries are rated \u201bA-\u2019 (Strong) by Standard and Poor\u2019s, also with a negative outlook.\nA.M. Best is a widely recognized insurance company rating agency and some policyholders are required to obtain insurance coverage from insurance companies that have an \u201cA-\u201d (Excellent) rating or higher from A.M. Best. Additionally, many producers are prohibited from placing insurance with companies that are rated below \u201cA-\u201d (Excellent). As the Company continues to assess the impact of the downgrade, to date there has been no evidence that this change in rating has materially impacted the Company\u2019s business operations, impaired our ability to sell insurance policies or adversely affected our competitive position in the insurance industry.\nOur use of strategic transactions to further our growth strategy may not succeed.\nOur strategy for growth may include mergers and acquisitions, as well as divestitures. This strategy presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance, including: (1) the diversion of management\u2019s attention, (2) our ability to execute a transaction effectively, including the integration of operations and the retention of employees, (3) our ability to retain key employees and (4) the contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of and other unanticipated problems arising from an acquisition partner. We may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or which are of a different character or magnitude than expected.\nWe cannot predict whether we will be able to identify and complete a future transaction on terms favorable to us. We cannot know if we will realize the anticipated benefits of a completed transaction or if there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with such a transaction. In addition, strategic transactions may expose us to increased litigation risks. A future merger or acquisition may result in tax consequences at either or both the shareholder and Argo Group level, potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt and the recognition of potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Each of these factors could adversely affect our financial position.\nReputational Risk\nReputational risk is the risk of potential loss through a deterioration of our reputation or standing due to a negative perception of our image among customers, counterparties, shareholders or supervisory authorities, and includes risk of adverse publicity regarding our business practices and associations. While we assess the reputational impact of all reasonably foreseeable material risks within our risk management processes, we also recognize a number of specific reputational risks.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to sanctions, anti-corruption and money laundering, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nOur activities are subject to applicable economic and trade sanctions, money laundering regulations, and anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions where we operate, including Bermuda, the U.K. and the European Community and the U.S., among others. For example, we are subject to The Bribery Act, 2016, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, which, among other matters, generally prohibit corrupt payments or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. We believe we maintain strong oversight and control through the deployment of our internal Group-wide Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Conduct and Business Ethics and associated policies and procedures including the Company\u2019s whistleblower policies and continuous education and training programs. However, although we have in place systems and controls designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, there is a risk that those systems and controls will not always be effective to achieve full compliance. Failure to accurately interpret or comply with or obtain appropriate authorizations and/or exemptions under such laws or regulations could subject us to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license, reputational consequences, and other sanctions, all of which could damage our business or reputation. Such damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nActions of activist shareholders could impact the pursuit of our business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or share price.\nWe value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance. Our Board and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by the Board and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with certain shareholders will be successful.\nCampaigns by activist shareholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term shareholder value by means of financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, share repurchases, sales of assets or other transactions. Campaigns may also be initiated by activist shareholders advocating for particular environmental or social causes. Activist shareholders who disagree with the composition of a publicly traded company\u2019s board of directors, or with its strategy and/or management seek to involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of a company through various activities that range from private engagement to publicity campaigns, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by the Company\u2019s Board, and in some instances, litigation.\nWe have been and may in the future be subject to activities initiated by activist shareholders. After a prolonged discussion on matters concerning governance and operations issues, in December 2019, Argo Group entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cCooperation Agreement\u201d) with Voce Catalyst Partners LP, Voce Capital Management LLC, Voce Capital LLC and Voce Catalyst Partners New York LLC (collectively, \u201cVoce\u201d). Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, Voce terminated its solicitation of consents to authorize the requisition of a special general meeting of shareholders of the Company, among other items. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our Board and employees from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. As a result, activist shareholder campaigns could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or share price.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risks\nThe regulation and regulatory measures that would apply to the Argo Group and its subsidiaries are discussed above under \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation\u201d.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk means the risk arising from our (1) failure to comply with statutory or regulatory obligations; (2) failure to comply with our Bye-Laws; or (3) failure to comply with any contractual agreement.\nLitigation Risk means the risk that acts or omissions or other business activity of Argo Group and our key functionaries and employees could result in legal proceedings to which we are a party, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of such legal proceedings and the risk of an adverse impact on us resulting from such legal proceedings.\nThe outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation related to our business operations, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation in connection with our business operations. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. If one or more of such matters were decided against us, the effects could be material to our results of operations in the period in which we would be required to record or adjust the related liability and could also be material to our cash flows in the periods that we would be required to pay such liability.\nRegulatory constraints may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nArgo Group\u2019s ownership of U.S. subsidiaries can, under applicable state insurance company laws and regulations, delay or impede a change of control of Argo Group. Under applicable insurance regulations, any proposed purchase of 10% or more of Argo Group\u2019s voting securities would require the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulatory authorities. See \u201cDescription of Share Capital-Restrictions on Ownership Under Insurance Laws.\u201d\nOur insurance subsidiaries and insurance-related services subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses, permits or authorizations, or may be able to do so only at significant cost. In addition, we may not be able to comply with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies or insurance-related services companies or holding companies. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and/or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or certain activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions and could subject us to fines and other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBermuda Subsidiaries\nArgo Group is supervised by the BMA as an Insurance Group. In addition, Argo Re is registered as a Class 4 Bermuda insurance company, and Argo Insurance Services Bermuda, Ltd. is licensed by the BMA pursuant to Section 10 of the Insurance Act as an Insurance Agent and as an Insurance Manager. As such, Argo Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to specific laws, rules and regulations promulgated by the Bermudian authorities according to the Insurance Act. Changes in Bermuda\u2019s statutes, regulations and policies could result in restrictions on our ability to pursue our business plans, strategic objectives, execute our investment strategy and fulfill other shareholders\u2019 obligations.\nU.S. Subsidiaries\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation, which may reduce our profitability or inhibit our growth. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Finally, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to pursue our business plan and operate our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\nFrom time to time, various laws and regulations are proposed for application to the U.S. insurance industry, some of which could adversely affect the results of reinsurers and insurers. Additionally, the NAIC has been responsible for establishing certain regulatory and corporate governance requirements, which are intended to result in a group-wide supervision focus and include the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and the Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation, the Requirements for ERM Report within the Annual Holding Company Registration (i.e., Form F), the Supervisory College, the Risk Management and ORSA Model, the CGAD and the Revisions to Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation to expand the corporate audit function to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of enterprise risk management, internal controls, and corporate governance. We are unable to predict the potential effect, if any, such legislative or regulatory developments may have on our future operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny, suspend or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities may preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nU.K. Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Conduct Authority Regulations and Lloyd\u2019s Supervision\nSince 2014 the regulatory supervision of Argo Managing Agency Limited, the managing agent of S1200 has been performed by PRA and the FCA. The operations of S1200 also continue to be supervised by Lloyd\u2019s. Future regulatory changes or rulings by the PRA and/or FCA as well as the supervision of Lloyd\u2019s could interfere with the business strategy or financial assumptions of the Syndicates, possibly resulting in an adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results of the Syndicates.\nOther Applicable Laws\nLloyd\u2019s insurance business is subject to various regulations, laws, treaties and other applicable policies of the E.U., as well as those of each nation, state and locality in which Lloyd\u2019s operates. These nations include Malta, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore. Material changes in governmental requirements and laws could have an adverse effect on Lloyd\u2019s and its member companies, including S1200.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are originally recorded at fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators are present. Management, in evaluating the recoverability of such assets, relies on estimates and assumptions related to margin, growth rates, discount rates and other data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management\u2019s judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges can result from declines in operating results, divestitures or sustained market capitalization declines and other factors. Impairment charges could materially affect our financial results in the period in which they are recognized.\nSome aspects of our corporate structure and applicable insurance regulations may discourage or impede the sale of the Company, tender offers or other mechanisms of control.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governance documents may have the effect of making it more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties. To the extent that these effects occur, shareholders could be deprived of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares and the market price of their shares could be depressed. In addition, these provisions could also result in the entrenchment of incumbent management and Board members.\nVoting Restrictions\nIn the event that we become aware of a U.S. Person (that owns our shares directly or indirectly through non-U.S. entities) owning more than the permitted 9.5% level of voting power of our outstanding shares after a transfer of shares has been registered, our Bye-Laws provide that, subject to certain exceptions and waiver procedures, the voting rights with respect to our shares owned by any such shareholder will be limited to the permitted level of voting power, subject only to the further limitation that no other shareholder allocated any such voting rights may exceed the permitted level of voting power as a result of such limitation.\n\u2022We also have the authority under our Bye-Laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder\u2019s voting rights are to be reallocated under the Bye-Laws. If a shareholder fails to respond to such a request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to such a request, we may, at our sole discretion, eliminate such shareholder\u2019s voting rights.\n\u2022Transfer Restrictions. Our Bye-Laws generally permit transfers of our common shares unless the Board determines a transfer may result in a non-de minimus adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequence to us, any of our subsidiaries or any direct or indirect shareholder of Argo Group or its affiliates. We may refuse to register on our share transfer records, any transfer that does not comply with these share transfer restrictions. A transferee will be permitted to promptly dispose of any of our shares purchased that violate the restrictions and as to the transfer of which registration is refused.\nChange of control\n\u2022Restrictions. Because a person who acquires control of Argo Group would thereby acquire indirect control of the same percentage of the stock in its insurance company subsidiaries, change of control provisions in the laws and other rules applicable to our insurance subsidiaries in various jurisdictions would apply to such a transaction. Such change of control provisions generally apply to transactions involving the acquisition of direct or indirect control over 10% or more of our outstanding shares. No assurance can be given that an applicable regulatory body would approve of any future change of control. These change of control provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Argo Group, including transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.\nWe are a Bermuda company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us and/or our directors and executive officers.\nWe are organized under the laws of Bermuda and headquartered in Bermuda. The Companies Act, and its subsequent amendments, which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, our right to enter into business transactions with shareholders without prior approval from shareholders, committee organization and scope of indemnification available to directors and officers.\nIn addition, certain of our directors and officers reside outside the U.S. As such, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the U.S. on our directors and officers who reside outside the U.S. or to enforce against us or our directors and officers judgments of U.S. courts, predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.\nWe have been advised that there is doubt as to whether:\n\u2022a holder of our common shares would be able to enforce, in the courts of Bermuda, judgments of U.S. courts against persons who reside in Bermuda based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws;\n\u2022a holder of our common shares would be able to enforce, in the courts of Bermuda, judgments of U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws; and\n\u2022a holder of our common shares would be able to bring an original action in the Bermuda courts to enforce liabilities against us or our directors or officers, as well as our independent accountants, who reside outside the U.S. based solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.\nFurther, we have been advised that there is no treaty in effect between the U.S. and Bermuda providing for the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, and there are grounds upon which Bermuda courts may not enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Because judgments of U.S. courts are not automatically enforceable in Bermuda, it may be difficult for our shareholders to recover against us based on such judgments.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nU.S. Tax Risks Applicable to Argo Group\nOur non-U.S. companies may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their net income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nExcept with respect to certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries organized in the U.K. that are Lloyd\u2019s corporate members, (\u201cLloyd\u2019s Companies\u201d), Argo Group and our non-U.S. subsidiaries that are treated as foreign corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (collectively, our \u201cNon-U.S. Companies\u201d) have operated and currently intend to continue to operate in a manner that is intended not to cause them to be treated as engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. (or, in the case of our Non-U.S. Companies qualifying for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty, in a manner that is intended not to cause them to be treated as having a permanent establishment in the U.S.). Therefore, we believe that our Non-U.S. Companies (other than the Lloyd\u2019s Companies) should not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their net income. However, ongoing severe travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic may make it more difficult for us to operate as intended. In addition, the enactment of the BEAT (defined below), the reduction of the U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations included in the Tax Act (defined below) and other factors may cause us to alter our intentions. Further, there is uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States (or having a permanent establishment in the United States), and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may disagree with our intended position. If any such Non-U.S. Companies are considered to be engaged in a trade or business (or carrying on business through a permanent establishment) in the United States, they generally would be subject to U.S. federal income taxation on the portion of their net income treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (or their business profits attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment, as applicable), including a branch profits tax. Any such U.S. federal income taxation could result in substantial tax liabilities and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe reinsurance agreements between our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to re-characterization or other adjustment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nUnder Section 845 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \u201cCode\u201d), the IRS may allocate income, deductions, assets, reserves, credits and any other items related to a reinsurance agreement among certain related parties to the reinsurance agreement, re-characterize such items or make any other adjustment in order to reflect the proper source, character or amount of the items for each party. Any such adjustment by the IRS to our reinsurance arrangements may result in an increase in our U.S. federal income tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be subject to increased tax liabilities under the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Public Law No: 115-97) (\u201cthe Tax Act\u201d) introduced a new tax called the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d). The BEAT operates as a minimum tax and is generally calculated as a percentage (10% for taxable years before 2026 and 12.5% thereafter) of the \u201cmodified taxable income\u201d of an \u201capplicable taxpayer.\u201d Modified taxable income is calculated by adding back to a taxpayer\u2019s regular taxable income the amount of certain \u201cbase erosion tax benefits\u201d with respect to certain payments made to foreign affiliates of the taxpayer, as well as the \u201cbase erosion percentage\u201d of any net operating loss deductions. The BEAT applies for a taxable year only to the extent it exceeds a taxpayer\u2019s regular corporate income tax liability for such year (determined without regard to certain tax credits).\nCertain of our subsidiaries organized in the United States (\u201cU.S. Subsidiaries\u201d) and our Lloyd\u2019s Companies are applicable taxpayers and make payments to foreign affiliates that produce base erosion tax benefits. As a result, they may be required to pay additional tax in one or more years by reason of the BEAT. Further, the application of the BEAT to our reinsurance arrangements involves various interpretations. If the IRS were to disagree with our BEAT calculations, we may be required to pay additional tax, interest and penalties.\nChanges in U.S. tax law might adversely affect us or our shareholders.\nThe tax treatment of our Non-U.S. Companies and their U.S. and non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries may be the subject of further tax legislation. No prediction can be made as to whether any particular proposed legislation will be enacted or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be, or whether it would have any effect on us. As such, we cannot assure you that future legislative, administrative or judicial developments will not result in an increase in the amount of U.S. tax payable by us or by an investor in our equity securities. If any such developments occur, it could have a material and adverse effect on an investor or our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. persons who own our equity securities may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation at ordinary income rates on our undistributed earnings and profits.\nFor any taxable year in which a Non-U.S. Company is treated as a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d), a \u201c10% U.S. Shareholder\u201d (as defined below) of such Non-U.S. Company that held our equity securities directly or indirectly through certain entities as of the last day in such taxable year that the company was a CFC would generally be required to (A) include in gross income as ordinary income its pro rata share of the company\u2019s insurance income and certain other investment income and (B) take into account its pro rata share of such company\u2019s \u201ctested income\u201d and certain other amounts in determining such 10% U.S. Shareholder\u2019s global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d), regardless of whether any amounts are actually distributed to such U.S. person. A \u201c10% U.S. Shareholder\u201d of an entity treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a U.S. person who owns (directly, indirectly through non-U.S. entities or constructively) 10% or more of the total value of all classes of shares of the corporation or 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting shares of the corporation. Any U.S. person that owns (or is treated as owning) 10% or more of the vote or value of our shares should consult with their tax advisor regarding their investment in Argo Group.\nIn general, a non-U.S. corporation is a CFC if 10% U.S. Shareholders, in the aggregate, own (directly, indirectly through non-U.S. entities or constructively) stock of the non-U.S. corporation possessing more than 50% of the voting power or value of such corporation\u2019s stock. However, this threshold is lowered to 25% for purposes of taking into account the insurance income of a non-U.S. corporation. Special rules apply for purposes of taking into account any related person insurance income (\u201cRPII\u201d) of a non-U.S. corporation, as described below.\nThe Tax Act expanded the definition of \u201c10% U.S. Shareholder\u201d to include ownership by value (rather than just vote), so provisions in our bye-laws that generally limit the voting power of our common shares (and certain other of our voting securities) such that no person owns (or is treated as owning) more than 9.5% of the total voting power of our common shares (with certain exceptions) will no longer mitigate the potential risk of \u201c10% U.S. Shareholder status\u201d.\nMoreover, the Tax Act eliminated the prohibition on \u201cdownward attribution\u201d from non-U.S. persons to U.S. persons under Section 958(b)(4) of the Code for purposes of determining constructive stock ownership under the CFC rules. As a result, our U.S. Subsidiaries are treated as constructively owning all of the stock of our Non-U.S. Companies, other than possibly Argo Group, Argo Re and Argo Ireland. Further, if Argo Group or Argo Re directly or indirectly own an interest in any U.S. entities treated as such for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such U.S. entities may constructively own all of the stock of Argo Re and/or Argo Ireland. Accordingly, our Non-U.S. Companies (other than Argo Group, Argo Re and Argo Ireland) are currently treated as CFCs and Argo Group, Argo Re and Argo Ireland may be so treated. The legislative history under the Tax Act suggests that this change in law was not intended to cause a foreign corporation to be treated as a CFC with respect to a 10% U.S. Shareholder that is not related to the U.S. persons receiving such downward attribution. However, it is not clear whether the IRS or a court would interpret the change made by the Tax Act in a manner consistent with such indicated intent.\nBecause of the limitations in Argo Group\u2019s bye-laws referred to above, among other factors, we believe it is unlikely that any U.S. person that is treated as owning less than 10% of the total value of Argo Group would be a 10% U.S. Shareholder of any of the Non-U.S. Companies. However, because the relevant attribution rules are complex and there is no definitive legal authority on whether the voting provisions included in Argo Group\u2019s organizational documents are effective for purposes of the CFC provisions, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.\nIf Argo Group is classified as a passive foreign investment company, U.S. persons who own our equity securities could be subject to adverse U.S federal income tax consequences.\nIf Argo Group is considered a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d), a U.S. person who directly or, in certain cases, indirectly owns our equity securities could be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply, an interest charge on certain taxes that are deemed deferred as a result of Argo Group\u2019s non-U.S. status and additional U.S. tax filing obligations, regardless of the number of shares owned. In general, Argo Group will be a PFIC during a taxable year if (1) 75% or more of its gross income constitutes passive income or (2) 50% or more of its assets produce, or are held for the production of, passive income (\u201cpassive assets\u201d). For these purposes, passive income includes interest, dividends and other investment income, with certain exceptions, and certain look-through rules apply with respect to interests in subsidiaries. However, under an \u201cactive insurance\u201d exception in the Code and applicable regulations, passive income does not include any income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a qualifying insurance corporation (\u201cQIC\u201d) or any income of a qualifying domestic insurance corporation (\u201cQDIC\u201d), and passive assets do not include assets of a QIC available to satisfy liabilities of the QIC related to its insurance business, if the QIC is engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business, or assets of a QDIC.\nWe believe that Argo Group should not be, and currently do not expect Argo Group to become, a PFIC. This is based in part on the belief that the income and assets of certain of Argo Group\u2019s subsidiaries qualifies for the active insurance exception. The Tax Act modified certain provisions relating to PFIC status that makes it more difficult for a non-U.S. insurance company to qualify under the active insurance exception. We believe that we qualify for the exception as amended. However, we cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with this conclusion. The U.S. Treasury and the IRS issued finalized regulations that provide guidance on the amended exception. The finalized regulations provide that a non-U.S. insurer will qualify for the active insurance exception only if, among other things, the non-U.S. insurer satisfies the active conduct percentage test, which test compares the expenses for services of officers and employees of the non-U.S. insurer and certain related entities incurred for the production of premium and certain investment income to all such expenses regardless of the service provider. Depending on which expenses are included in the test, there is risk that one or more of our Non-U.S. insurance companies would be considered a PFIC in one or more taxable years, in which case Argo Group may also be a PFIC in such taxable years. If Argo Group is treated as a PFIC, the adverse tax consequences described above generally would apply with respect to a U.S. person\u2019s direct or indirect ownership interest Argo Group and any PFICs in which Argo Group directly or, in certain cases, indirectly owns an interest.\nU.S. persons who own our equity securities may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences if we recognize RPII.\nIf any of our Non-U.S. Companies is treated as recognizing RPII in a taxable year and is also treated as a CFC for such taxable year, each U.S. person that owns our equity securities directly or indirectly through certain entities as of the last day in such taxable year must generally include in gross income its pro rata share of the RPII, determined as if the RPII were distributed proportionately only to all such U.S. persons, regardless of whether that income is distributed. For this purpose, a Non-U.S. Company generally will be treated as a CFC if U.S. persons in the aggregate are treated as owning (directly or indirectly through non-U.S. entities) 25% or more of the total voting power or value of such Non-U.S. Company\u2019s stock at any time during the taxable year. Further, RPII is generally defined as insurance income of a CFC that is attributable to a policy of insurance or reinsurance with respect to which the person (directly or indirectly) insured is a U.S. person who owns (directly or indirectly through non-U.S. entities) stock in the CFC or a related person to any such a U.S. person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to a de minimis exception, the RPII rules will not apply with respect to a CFC for a taxable year if the amount of RPII for such year was less than 20% of the CFC\u2019s gross insurance income in such taxable year.\nThe amount of RPII earned by our Non-U.S Companies that are engaged in insurance activities (our \u201cNon-U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries\u201d) will depend on a number of factors, including the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or reinsured by them. We believe that the gross RPII of each Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary did not in prior years of operation, and expect that it will not in the foreseeable future, equal or exceed 20% of such subsidiary\u2019s gross insurance income. No assurance can be given that this was or will be the case because some of the factors that determine the existence or extent of RPII may be beyond our knowledge and/or control.\nThe RPII rules also generally provide that if a U.S. person disposes of shares in an insurance company that is a CFC for RPII purposes (without regard to the de minimis exception described above), any gain from the disposition will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the U.S. person\u2019s share of the corporation\u2019s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the U.S. person owned the shares and not previously subject to tax under the CFC rules (whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to RPII). In addition, such U.S. person will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, regardless of the number of shares owned by the U.S. person. There is a strong argument these RPII rules do not apply to dispositions of our shares because Argo Group will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business. The RPII provisions, however, have never been interpreted by the courts or the U.S. Treasury in final regulations. Accordingly, the meaning of the RPII provisions and application of those provisions to our Non-U.S. Companies and investors that hold shares of Argo Group are uncertain.\nU.S. tax-exempt organizations that own our equity securities may recognize unrelated business taxable income.\nA U.S. tax-exempt organization that directly or indirectly owns our equity securities generally will recognize unrelated business taxable income and be subject to additional U.S. tax filing obligations to the extent such tax-exempt organization is required to take into account any of our insurance income or RPII pursuant to the CFC and RPII rules described above. U.S. tax-exempt organizations should consult their own tax advisors regarding the risk of recognizing unrelated business taxable income as a result of the ownership our equity securities.\nOur Lloyd\u2019s Companies may not be eligible for benefits under the U.S.-U.K. income tax treaty.\nOur Lloyd\u2019s Companies are subject to tax in the United States pursuant to the terms of the Closing Agreement among Lloyd\u2019s, Lloyd\u2019s members and the IRS. We believe that certain of our Lloyd\u2019s Companies are entitled to benefits under the income tax treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.S.-U.K. Treaty\u201d) based on their conduct as an active trade or business in the UK. Were the IRS to contend successfully that such Lloyd\u2019s Companies were not eligible for benefits under the U.S.-U.K. Treaty, such Lloyd\u2019s Companies may be required to pay additional taxes such as excise tax on certain premiums and branch profits tax. Such a result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nDividends paid by our U.S. subsidiaries to Argo Ireland may not be eligible for benefits under the U.S.-Ireland income tax treaty.\nUnder U.S. federal income tax law, dividends paid by a U.S. corporation to a non-U.S. shareholder are generally subject to a 30% withholding tax. The income tax treaty between the Republic of Ireland and the United States (the \u201cU.S.-Ireland Treaty\u201d) reduces the rate of withholding tax on certain dividends to 5% if paid to a company entitled to benefits under the U.S.-Ireland Treaty that owns at least 10% of the voting stock of the company paying the dividend. We believe that Argo Financial Holding (Ireland) UC (\u201cArgo Ireland\u201d) is eligible for benefits under the U.S.-Ireland Treaty based on the country of residence of our shareholders and certain other factors and therefore entitled to the reduced, 5% withholding tax rate on dividends distributed to it from our U.S. Subsidiaries. However, such determination may change for any given taxable year and we may not have sufficient information to demonstrate that Argo Ireland is entitled to benefits under the U.S.-Ireland Treaty for any given year. Were the IRS to contend successfully that Argo Ireland was not eligible for benefits under the U.S.-Ireland Treaty for a taxable year in which our U.S. Subsidiaries made a distribution to Argo Ireland treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such distribution would be subject to withholding tax at the 30% rate. Such a result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nU.K. Tax Risks\nOur non-U.K. companies may be subject to U.K. tax.\nCompanies which are incorporated outside the U.K. may nonetheless become subject to U.K. tax in a number of circumstances, including (without limitation) circumstances in which (1) they are resident in the U.K. for tax purposes by reason of their central management and control being exercised from the U.K. or (2) they are treated as carrying on a trade, investing or carrying on any other business activity in the U.K. (whether or not through a U.K. permanent establishment). In addition, the Finance Act 2015 introduced a new tax known as the \u201cdiverted profits tax\u201d (\u201cDPT\u201d) which is charged at 25% of any \u201ctaxable diverted profits\u201d. The DPT has had effect since April 1, 2015 and may apply in circumstances including: (1) where arrangements are designed to ensure that a non-U.K. resident company does not carry on a trade in the U.K. through a permanent establishment\u037e and (2) where a tax reduction is secured through the involvement of entities or transactions lacking economic substance.\nWe intend to operate in such a manner that none of our companies should be subject to the U.K. DPT and that none of our companies (other than those companies incorporated in the U.K.) should: (1) be a resident in the U.K. for tax purposes\u037e (2) carry on a trade, invest or carry on any other business activity in the U.K. (whether or not through a U.K. permanent establishment). However, this result is based on certain legal and factual determinations, and since the scope and the basis upon which the DPT will be applied by HM Revenue & Customs (\u201cHMRC\u201d) in the U.K. remains uncertain and since applicable law and regulations do not conclusively define the activities that constitute conducting a trade, investment or business activity in the U.K. (whether or not through a U.K. permanent establishment), and since we cannot exclude the possibility that there will be a change in law that adversely affects the analysis, HMRC might successfully assert a contrary position. The terms of an income tax treaty between the U.K. and the home country of the relevant Argo subsidiary, if any, could contain additional protections against U.K. tax.\nAny arrangements between U.K.-resident entities of Argo and other entities of Argo are subject to the U.K. transfer pricing regime. Consequently, if any agreement between a U.K. resident entity of Argo and any other Argo entity (whether that entity is resident in or outside of the U.K.) is found not to be on arm\u2019s length terms and as a result a U.K. tax advantage is being obtained, an adjustment will be required to compute U.K. taxable profits as if such an agreement were on arm\u2019s length terms. Any transfer pricing adjustment could adversely impact the tax charge incurred by the relevant U.K. resident entities of Argo.\nBermuda Tax Risks\nArgo Group and our Bermuda subsidiaries may become subject to Bermuda taxes after 2035.\nBermuda currently imposes no income tax on corporations. In addition, we have obtained an assurance from the Bermuda Minister of Finance, under The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda, that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to us or our Bermuda subsidiaries, until March 31, 2035. During 2011, legislation was passed to extend the period of the assurance mentioned above from 2016 to March 31, 2035. We filed for, and received, an extension of the assurance in January of 2012.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), the E.U. and individual jurisdictions may pursue additional measures to address base erosion and profit shifting that could have adverse tax consequences for us and increase our reporting requirements.\nIn 2015, the OECD published final recommendations on base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d). These recommendations proposed the development of rules directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world.\nSeveral of the areas of tax law on which the BEPS project has focused have led or will lead to changes in the domestic law of individual OECD jurisdictions. These changes include (amongst others) restrictions on interest and other deductions for tax purposes, the introduction of broad anti-hybrid regimes and reform of controlled foreign company rules. Changes are also expected to arise in the application of certain double tax treaties as a result of the implementation and adoption of the OECD\u2019s Multilateral Instrument, which may restrict the ability of Argo entities to rely on the terms of relevant double tax treaties in certain circumstances. Further, recent BEPS developments include proposals for new profit allocation and nexus rules and for rules to ensure that the profits of multinational enterprises are subject to a minimum rate of tax.\nIn parallel with the OECD\u2019s BEPS project, E.U. Member States were required to implement by January 2020 (subject to a few exceptions) new domestic legislation giving effect to the EC\u2019s (amended) Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (\u201cATAD\u201d, with the amendment being commonly known as \u201cATAD II\u201d). ATAD II mandates domestic legislation counteracting certain hybrid mismatches (anti-hybrid rules), to complement the existing changes (interest deductibility restrictions, controlled foreign company rules, etc.) brought about by ATAD.\nChanges of law in individual jurisdictions which may arise as a result of the BEPS project or the implementation of ATAD/ATAD II may ultimately increase the tax base of individual Argo entities in certain jurisdictions or the worldwide tax exposure of Argo entities. Those changes of law are also potentially relevant to the ability of Argo entities to efficiently fund and realize investments or repatriate income or capital gains from relevant jurisdictions, and could ultimately necessitate some restructuring of Argo entities or their business operations. The changes of law resulting from the BEPS project also include revisions to the definition of a \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d and the rules for attributing profit to a permanent establishment. Other BEPS-related changes focus on the goal of ensuring that transfer pricing outcomes are in line with value creation.\nChanges to tax laws resulting from the BEPS project or as a result of ATAD/ATAD II could increase their complexity and the burden and costs of compliance. Additionally, such changes could also result in significant modifications to existing transfer pricing rules and could potentially have an impact on our taxable profits in various jurisdictions.\nSince 2017 (and in consequence of the BEPS project), some countries in which we do business, including Bermuda, have required certain multinational enterprises, including ours, to report detailed information regarding allocation of revenue, profit, and other information, on a country- by-country basis. The information we are required to report pursuant to this country-by-country reporting (as well as information we are required to report pursuant to certain other exchange of information regimes (for example, e.g., pursuant to the Common Reporting Standard) could ultimately result in certain tax authorities having greater access to information enabling them to challenge the tax positions of Argo entities in a number of different areas, especially transfer pricing.", "PERMNO": 11203, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "ARGO"}
