{"cik": "1128361", "company": "BBCN BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn the course of conducting its business operations, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to its own business. The following discussion addresses the most significant risks that could affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline.\nRisk relating to our business\nEconomic conditions in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our loan portfolio and reduce the demand for our services. We focus our business primarily in Korean-American communities in California, the greater New York City, Chicago and Seattle metropolitan areas, New Jersey and Virginia. Adverse economic conditions in our market areas have had a material adverse impact on the quality of our business. A renewed economic slowdown in the markets in which we operate currently and in the future may have any or all of the following consequences, any of which may reduce our net income and adversely affect our financial condition:\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022\nproblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nthe level and duration of deposits may decline;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline; and\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans may decline in value below the principal amount owed by the borrower.\nWe have a high level of loans secured by real estate collateral. A downturn in the real estate market may seriously impair our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 80% of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by various types of real estate. Following the financial crisis of 2008, there was a general slowdown in the economy and declines in value in real estate. Although the economy has rebounded and real estate prices have gradually recovered from their earlier low levels, it is possible that that there will be renewed deterioration in the real estate market generally and in commercial real estate values in particular, along with higher levels of unemployment. Such developments may result in additional loan charge-offs and provisions for loan losses, which may have a material and adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nOur commercial loan and commercial real estate loan portfolios expose us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to our other loans . Our loan portfolio includes commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are secured by hotels & motels, shopping/retail centers, service station & car wash, industrial & warehouse properties and other types of commercial properties. Commercial and commercial real estate loans carry more risk as compared to other types of lending, because they typically involve larger loan balances often concentrated with a single borrower or groups of related borrowers.\nAccordingly, charge-offs on commercial and commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. In addition, these loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate. The payment experience on commercial real estate loans that are secured by income producing properties are typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus, may subject us to adverse conditions in the real estate market or to the general economy. The collateral securing these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than residential properties because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral.\nUnexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial or commercial real estate loan portfolios would require us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, with respect to commercial real estate loans, federal and state banking regulators are examining commercial real estate lending activity with heightened scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement more stringent underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures. Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial real estate loans, the banking regulators may require us to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain, which could limit our ability to leverage our capital and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not cover actual loan losses. If our actual loan losses exceed the amount we have allocated for estimated probable incurred losses, including loans we may acquire in our acquisition of Wilshire, our business will be adversely affected. We attempt to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting our loans, but losses nevertheless occur in the ordinary course of business operations. We create allowances for estimated loan losses through provisions that are recorded as reductions in income in our accounting records. We base these allowances on estimates of the following:\n\u2022\nhistorical experience with our loans;\n\u2022\nevaluation of current economic conditions and other factors;\n\u2022\nreviews of the quality, mix and size of the overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nreviews of delinquencies; and\n\u2022\nthe quality of the collateral underlying our loans.\nIf our allowance estimates are inadequate, we may incur losses, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected and we may be required to raise additional capital to enhance our capital position. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the adequacy of our allowance. These agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations. No assurance can be given that we will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for loan losses.\nChanges in interest rates affect our profitability. The interest rate risk inherent in our lending, investing, and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business. We derive our income mainly from the difference or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. In general, the wider the spread, the more net interest income we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can greatly affect our income. In addition, interest rate fluctuations can affect how much money we may be able to lend. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates.\nIf we lose key employees, our business may suffer. There is intense competition for experienced and highly qualified personnel in the Korean-American banking industry. Our future success depends on the continued employment of existing senior management personnel. If we lose key employees temporarily or permanently, it may hurt our business. We may be particularly hurt if our key employees, including any of our executive officers, became employed by our competitors in the Korean-American banking industry.\nEnvironmental laws may force us to pay for environmental problems. The cost of cleaning up or paying damages and penalties associated with environmental problems may increase our operating expenses. When a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property, we often purchase the property in foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower. We may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. We also lease premises where our branches and other facilities are located, all where environmental problems may exist. Although we have lending, foreclosure and facilities guidelines that are intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances may exist on some of the properties that we own, lease, manage or occupy. We may face the risk that environmental laws may force us to clean up the properties at our expense. The cost of cleaning up a property may exceed the value of the property. We may also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower\u2019s operations if we take a role in managing those operations after a default. We may find it difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties.\nWe are exposed to the risks of natural disasters. A significant portion of our operations is concentrated in Southern California, which is an earthquake-prone region. A major earthquake may result in material loss to us. A significant percentage of our loans are and will be secured by real estate. Many of our borrowers may suffer uninsured property damage, experience interruption of their businesses or lose their jobs after an earthquake. Those borrowers might not be able to repay their loans, and the collateral for such loans may decline significantly in value. Unlike a bank with operations that are more geographically diversified, we are vulnerable to greater losses if an earthquake, fire, flood, mudslide or other natural catastrophe occurs in Southern California.\nAn increase in nonperforming assets would reduce our income and increase our expenses. If the level of nonperforming assets increases in the future, it may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Nonperforming assets are mainly loans on which the borrowers are not making their required payments. Nonperforming assets also include loans that have been restructured to permit the borrower to make payments and real estate that has been acquired\nthrough foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of unpaid loans. To the extent that assets are nonperforming, we have less earning assets generating interest income and an increase in credit related expenses, including provisions for loan losses.\nWe may experience adverse effects from acquisitions. We have acquired other banking companies and bank offices in the past, anticipate closing the acquisition with Wilshire in mid-2016, and will consider additional acquisitions as opportunities arise. If we do not adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with acquisitions of other companies, we may incur material unexpected costs and disruption of our business. Future acquisitions may increase the degree of such risks.\nRisks involved in acquisitions of other companies include:\n\u2022\nthe risk of failure to adequately evaluate the asset quality of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other important business activities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining good relations with the loan and deposit customers of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities; and\n\u2022\namortization of expenses related to acquired intangible assets that have finite lives.\nLiquidity risks may impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and other sources may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities may be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that may detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow may also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry or the general financial services industry as a whole.\nIncreases in the level of our problem assets, occurrence of operating losses or a failure to comply with requirements of the agencies which regulate us may result in regulatory actions against us which may materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. The DBO, the FDIC and the FRB each have authority to take actions to require that we comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements, cease engaging in what they perceive to be unsafe or unsound practices or make other changes in our business. Among others, the corrective measures that such regulatory authorities may take include requiring us to enter into informal or formal agreements regarding our operations, the issuance of cease and desist orders to refrain from engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, removal of officers and directors and the assessment of civil monetary penalties. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation\u201d for a further description of such regulatory powers.\nChanges in accounting standards may affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes and their impacts on us can be hard to predict and may result in unexpected and materially adverse impacts on our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business. As a financial institution, we are susceptible to\nfraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents in recent periods. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on the networks and systems of us, our clients and certain of our third party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence. Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent cases have occurred, through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability - any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMore generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a financial institution. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to operational risks relating to our technology and information systems. The continued efficacy of our technology and information systems, related operational infrastructure and relationships with third party vendors in our ongoing operations is integral to our performance. Failure of any of these resources, including but not limited to operational or systems failures, interruptions of client service operations and ineffectiveness of or interruption in third party data processing or other vendor support, may cause material disruptions in our business, impairment of customer relations and exposure to liability for our customers, as well as action by bank regulatory authorities.\nOur business reputation is important and any damage to it may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reputation is very important for our business, as we rely on our relationships with our current, former and potential clients and stockholders, and in the communities we serve. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, our conduct of our business or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs we expand outside our California markets, we may encounter additional risks that may adversely affect us. Currently, the majority of our offices are located in California, but we also have offices in the New York City, Chicago and Seattle metropolitan areas, New Jersey and Virginia. If we are able to successfully consummate the merger, we will branch into Alabama, Georgia and Texas, and we will increase our banking presence in New Jersey and New York. Over time, we may seek to establish offices to serve Korean-American communities in other parts of the United States as well. In the course of these expansion activities, we may encounter significant risks, including unfamiliarity with the characteristics and business dynamics of new markets, increased marketing and administrative expenses and operational difficulties arising from our efforts to attract business in new markets, manage operations in noncontiguous geographic markets, comply with local laws and\nregulations and effectively and consistently manage our non-California personnel and business. If we are unable to manage these risks, our operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdverse conditions in South Korea or globally may adversely affect our business. A substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to South Korea and, as a result, we are likely to feel the effects of adverse economic and political conditions there. If economic conditions in South Korea deteriorate, we may, among other things, be exposed to economic and transfer risk, and may experience an outflow of deposits by our customers with connections to South Korea. Transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity. This may materially and adversely impact the recoverability of investments in or loans made to such entities. Adverse economic conditions in South Korea may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of our customers who operate in this region. In addition, a general overall decline in global economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our profitability and overall results of operations\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make loans secured by real property does not ensure that the value of the real property collateral will be sufficient to repay our loans. In considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made and requires the exercise of a considerable degree of judgment. If the appraisal does not accurately reflect the amount that may be obtained upon sale or foreclosure of the property, whether due to a decline in property value after the date of the original appraisal or defective preparation of the appraisal, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property and as a result, we may suffer losses.\nGovernmental regulation and regulatory actions against us may further impair our operations or restrict our growth. We are subject to significant governmental supervision and regulation. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Statutes and regulations affecting our business may be changed at any time and the interpretation of these statutes and regulations by examining authorities may also change. In addition, regulations may be adopted which increase our deposit insurance premiums and enact special assessments which could increase expenses associated with running our business and adversely affect our earnings.\nThere can be no assurance that such statutes and regulations, any changes thereto or to their interpretation will not adversely affect our business. In particular, these statutes and regulations, and any changes thereto, could subject us to additional costs (including legal and compliance costs), limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. In addition to governmental supervision and regulation, we are subject to changes in other federal and state laws, including changes in tax laws, which could materially affect us and the banking industry generally. We are subject to the rules and regulations of the FRB, the FDIC and the DBO, and may become subject to examination by the CFPB. In addition, we are subject to the rules and regulation of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the SEC and are subject to enforcement actions and other punitive actions by these agencies. If we fail to comply with federal and state regulations, the regulators may limit our activities or growth, impose fines on us or in the case of our bank regulators, ultimately require our bank to cease its operations. Bank regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated in the same manner or are less regulated. Federal and state bank regulatory agencies regulate many aspects of our operations. These areas include:\n\u2022\nthe capital that must be maintained;\n\u2022\nthe kinds of activities that can be engaged in;\n\u2022\nthe kinds and amounts of investments that can be made;\n\u2022\nthe locations of offices;\n\u2022\ninsurance of deposits and the premiums that we must pay for this insurance;\n\u2022\nprocedures and policies we must adopt;\n\u2022\nconditions and restrictions on our executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nhow much cash we must set aside as reserves for deposits.\nIn addition, bank regulatory authorities have the authority to bring enforcement actions against banks and bank holding companies, including the Bank and BBCN, for unsafe or unsound practices in the conduct of their businesses or for violations of any law, rule or regulation, any condition imposed in writing by the appropriate bank regulatory agency or any written agreement with the authority. Enforcement actions against us could include a federal conservatorship or receivership for the bank, the issuance of additional orders that could be judicially enforced, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, the issuance of directives to enter into a strategic transaction, whether by merger or otherwise, with a third party, the termination of insurance of deposits, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties, and the enforcement\nof such actions through injunctions or restraining orders. In addition, if we were able to grow beyond $10 billion in assets, including as a result of our proposed merger with Wilshire, we would be subject to enhanced CFPB examination as well as be required to perform more comprehensive stress-testing on our business and operations. See \u201cAdditional risks relating to our proposed merger with Wilshire\u201d below.\nSBA lending is an important part of our business. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the federal government, and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA loans. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the federal government. As an SBA Preferred Lender, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender\u2019s Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as a Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, and as a result we could experience a material adverse effect to our financial results. Any changes to the SBA program, including changes to the level of guarantee provided by the federal government on SBA loans, may also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe generally sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. These sales have resulted in both premium income for us at the time of sale, and created a stream of future servicing income. We may not be able to continue originating these loans or selling them in the secondary market. Furthermore, even if we are able to continue originating and selling SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market, we might not continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans. When we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and if a customer defaults on the non-guaranteed portion of a loan, we share any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to SBA loan products may change in the future. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies and especially our organization, changes in the laws, regulations and procedures applicable to SBA loans could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which may result in substantial losses for our stockholders. The market price of our common stock may be subject to fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nissuing new equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe amount of our common stock outstanding and the trading volume of our stock;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial performance estimates of us or by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ncompetitive developments, including announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions that affect the Bank\u2019s performance; and\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation or regulations that affect the Bank.\nWe may raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We periodically evaluate opportunities to access capital markets, taking into account our financial condition, regulatory capital ratios, business strategies, anticipated asset growth and other relevant considerations. It is possible that future acquisitions, organic growth or changes in regulatory capital requirements could require us to increase the amount or change the composition of our current capital, including our common equity. For all of these reasons and others, and always subject to market conditions, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other capital securities in public or private transactions.\nThe issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or that represent the right to receive common stock, or the exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to holders of our\ncommon stock. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive or other rights that would entitle them to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends in the future, as well as the ability of the Bank to make dividend payments to us, will be subject to regulatory, statutory and other restrictions. There can be no assurance that we will continue payment of regular cash dividends. Our ability to pay dividends at that time will be subject to statutory and other limitations applicable to us or to the Bank.\nOur results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected as a result of future impairment of our intangible assets. Future acquisitions could result in increases in the amount of our goodwill or other intangible assets. We assess the carrying value of intangible assets, including goodwill, at least annually in order to determine whether such assets are impaired. We make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. Effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and disclosures to stockholders, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and disclosures or prevent fraud, our business may be adversely affected and our reputation and operating results would be harmed. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures or difficulties encountered in their implementation may also result in regulatory enforcement action against us, adversely affect our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and applicable federal and state law may limit\nthe ability of another party to acquire us, which could cause our stock price to decline. Various provisions of our charter documents could delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. These include, among other things, advance notice requirements to submit stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings and the authorization to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock by action of the Board of Directors acting alone, thus without obtaining stockholder approval. In addition, applicable provisions of federal and state law require regulatory approval in connection with certain acquisitions of our common stock and supermajority voting provisions in connection with certain transactions. In particular, both federal and state law limit the acquisition of ownership of, generally, 10% or more of our common stock without providing prior notice to the regulatory agencies and obtaining prior regulatory approval or nonobjection or being able to rely on an exemption from such acquisition. Collectively, these provisions of our charter documents and applicable federal and state law may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nOur common stock is equity and therefore is subordinate to our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness and preferred stock. Our common stock constitutes equity interests and does not constitute indebtedness. As such, common stock will rank junior to all current and future indebtedness and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including in the event of our liquidation. We may, and the bank and our other subsidiaries may also, incur additional indebtedness from time to time and may increase our aggregate level of outstanding indebtedness. Additionally, holders of common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock that may be outstanding from time to time. The Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. If we issue preferred shares in the future that have a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, then the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur common stock is not insured and you could lose the value of your entire investment. An investment in our common stock is not a deposit and is not insured against loss by any government agency.\nAdditional risks relating to our proposed merger with Wilshire\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated, cannot be met or may have a material adverse effect on the combined company following the merger. Before the merger may be completed, we must obtain various approvals or consents from bank regulatory authorities, including the FRB, the FDIC and the DBO. These approvals or consents require consideration by the bank regulatory authorities of various factors, including assessments of the managerial and financial resources and future prospects of the resulting institutions and the competitive effect of the contemplated transactions. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended, also requires that the bank regulatory authorities, in deciding whether to approve the merger, assess the records of performance of BBCN Bank and Wilshire Bank in meeting the credit needs of the communities they serve, including low and\nmoderate income neighborhoods. As part of the review process under the Community Reinvestment Act, it is not unusual for the bank regulatory authorities to receive protests and other adverse comments from community groups and others. Any such protests or adverse comments could prolong the period during which the merger is subject to review by the bank regulatory authorities. The bank regulatory authorities also may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. Although we do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the growth, revenues or other aspects of the business of the combined company following the merger.\nThere can be no assurance as to whether the regulatory approvals or consents will be received, the timing of those approvals and consents, or whether any conditions will be imposed. The Merger Agreement contains a condition to the obligation of each of BBCN and Wilshire to close the merger that the required regulatory approvals and consents generally do not require any action, condition or restriction reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company after the merger. Accordingly, if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals and consents, the Merger Agreement may be terminated and the merger may not be completed.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending. Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair both our ability and Wilshire\u2019s ability to attract or motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and could cause customers, vendors and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with either us or Wilshire. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, the combined company\u2019s business following the merger could be negatively affected. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from making acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the merger occurs, without the consent of Wilshire. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nThe merger may distract our management and management of Wilshire from their other responsibilities which could adversely affect our business now and following the merger. The merger of Wilshire with us could cause the management of both us and Wilshire to focus their time and energies on matters related to the merger that otherwise would be directed to their respective businesses and operations. Any such distraction on the part of management, if significant, could affect the ability of us and/or Wilshire to service existing business and develop new business and may adversely affect their businesses and earnings. As a result, the business of the combined company following the merger may be less than valuable than we currently expect.\nCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected. We and Wilshire have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of BBCN and Wilshire upon the completion of the merger. It is possible that the integration process could result in:\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees,\n\u2022\nthe disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, or\n\u2022\ninconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe loss of key employees could adversely affect the ability of us, Wilshire and/or the combined company to successfully conduct businesses in the markets in which we and Wilshire now operate, which could have an adverse effect on their financial results and the value of our common stock. In addition, if the combined company experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us, Wilshire and/or the combined company to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us, Wilshire and/or the combined company and move their business to competing financial institutions. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on us each of us and Wilshire during this transition period and for an undetermined period after consummation of the merger.\nThe combined company may fail to realize cost savings for the merger. Although we expect to realize cost savings from the merger when fully phased in, it is possible that these potential cost savings may not be realized fully or realized at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. For example, future business developments may require the combined company to continue to operate or maintain some facilities or support functions that are currently expected to be combined or reduced. Cost savings also depend on our ability to combine the businesses of BBCN and Wilshire in a manner that permits those costs savings to be realized. If we are not able to combine the two companies successfully, these anticipated cost savings may not be fully realized or realized at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed. The Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to close. Those conditions include BBCN Bancorp stockholder approval, Wilshire shareholder approval, regulatory approvals, the continued accuracy of certain representations and warranties by both parties and the performance by both parties of certain covenants and agreements. In addition, BBCN Bancorp or Wilshire may choose to terminate the Merger Agreement if the other party makes a change in recommendation. In addition to the foregoing, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors or Wilshire\u2019s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, under certain circumstances BBCN or Wilshire may be required to pay a $40 million termination fee. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing the merger will be fulfilled or that the merger will be completed.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and result in other adverse consequences. If the merger is not completed for any reason, we will be subject to a number of material risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market prices of its shares reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed;\n\u2022\ncosts relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and, in specified circumstances, termination fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed and its anticipated benefits not realized;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day business operations or pursuit of other strategic opportunities and the potential disruption to our employees and business relationships during the period before the completion of the merger may make it difficult to regain financial and market positions if the merger does not occur; and\n\u2022\nif our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, holders of our common stock cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or greater consideration than that which it is expected to receive in the merger.\nThe termination fee and the restrictions on solicitation contained in the Merger Agreement may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us. Until the completion of the merger, with certain exceptions, we and Wilshire are each prohibited from initiating, soliciting, encouraging or knowingly facilitating any inquiries with respect to an acquisition proposal, such as a merger, business combination or similar transaction, with any person or entity other than each other. In addition, we and Wilshire have each agreed to pay a termination fee of $40 million to the other if it terminates the Merger Agreement to, among other things, enter into a definitive agreement relating to an acquisition proposal or if the other party terminates the Merger Agreement because, among other things, its board of directors fails to recommend the merger or makes a change in its recommendation of the merger, fails to prepare and mail to its stockholders this document or fails to comply with the provisions of the Merger Agreement prohibiting solicitation of other acquisition proposals. These provisions could discourage other companies from trying to acquire us even though such other companies might be willing to offer greater value to our stockholders than offered in the Merger Agreement. The payment of the termination fee also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nGoodwill resulting from the merger may adversely affect our results of operations. Goodwill and other intangible assets are expected to increase substantially as a result of the merger. Potential impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets could adversely affect each of our financial condition and results of operations. We assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment annually and more frequently when required by generally accepted accounting principles. We are required to record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their fair values. Our assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets could indicate that an impairment of the carrying value of such assets may have occurred that could result in a material, non-cash write-down of such assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future earnings.\nThe market price of our common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting our shares currently. Upon completion of the merger, holders of Wilshire common stock will become holders of our common stock. Our business differs in important respects from that of Wilshire, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of ourcommon stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of BBCN and Wilshire.\nHolders of our common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management. Holders of our common stock currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting us. Upon the completion of the merger, Wilshire shareholders will own approximately 41% of the outstanding shares of BBCN common stock immediately after the merger. As a result, our current stockholders as a group will own approximately 59% of the outstanding shares of our common stock immediately after the merger. Because of\nthis, our current stockholders may have less influence on the combined company than they now have on our management and policies.\nLitigation may be filed against the board of directors of Wilshire and/or BBCN that could prevent or delay the completion of the merger or result in the payment of damages following completion of the Merger. In connection with the merger, it is possible that Wilshire shareholders and/or BBCN stockholders may file putative class action lawsuits against boards of directors of Wilshire and/or BBCN. Among other remedies, these shareholders and/or stockholders could seek to enjoin the merger. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain. If a dismissal is not granted or a settlement is not reached, such potential lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to BBCN and Wilshire, including any costs associated with indemnification obligations of BBCN and/or Wilshire. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is consummated may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and market price.\nImplementation of the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act-in particular provisions that are applicable to banks and bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in assets-may delay the receipt of regulatory approvals and increase our operating costs or otherwise have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations after the merger. The Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010 significantly changes the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and the rule-making process is still underway.\nSeveral requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act for new banking regulations are applicable to certain banks and bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in assets. As a result of the merger, the combined company is expected to surpass this threshold, and these provisions, subject to a phase in period, may significantly increase compliance or operating costs of the combined company or otherwise have a significant impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. Such provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. Currently, the FDIC and the DBO examine both Wilshire Bank and BBCN Bank for compliance with consumer protection laws. However, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, and accordingly will assume examination and enforcement authority over the combined company following the merger.\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act increased the authority of the FRB to examine BBCN and its non-bank subsidiaries and gave the FRB the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for an electronic debit transaction by a payment card issuer that, together with its affiliates, has assets of $10 billion or more, and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer (the \u201cDurbin Amendment\u201d). By regulation, the FRB has limited the fees for such a transaction to the sum of 21 cents plus five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to one cent for fraud prevention costs. [Following the merger, the effect of the Durbin Amendment will be to lower our interchange or \u201cswipe\u201d revenue, but such lower fees are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum Designated Reserve Ratio (\u201cDRR\u201d). The FDIC has determined that the DRR should be 2.0% and has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15% on institutions with assets less than $10 billion. Following the Merger, we will not be entitled to benefit from the offset. The FDIC has not announced how it will implement this offset or how larger institutions will be affected by it.\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires a publicly traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in assets to establish and maintain a risk committee responsible for enterprise-wide risk management practices, comprised of an independent chairman and at least one risk management expert. The risk committee must approve and periodically review the risk-management policies of the bank holding company\u2019s global operations and oversee the operations of its risk-management framework. The bank holding company\u2019s risk-management framework must be commensurate with its structure, risk profile, complexity, activities and size. Assuming that the merger is consummated in the second half of 2016, these requirements should first apply to the combined company commencing on October 1, 2018. However, the combined company will need to build the necessary infrastructure to comply with these enhanced risk management requirements well before the effective date.\n\u2022\nA bank holding company with more than $10 billion in assets is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to conduct annual stress tests using various scenarios established by the FRB, including a baseline, adverse and severely adverse\neconomic conditions (known as \u201cDodd-Frank Act Stress Tests\u201d or \u201cDFAST\u201d). The stress tests are designed to determine whether the capital planning of the combined company, assessment of its capital adequacy and risk management practices adequately protect it and its affiliates in the event of an economic downturn. The combined company must establish adequate internal controls, documentation, policies and procedures to ensure the annual stress adequately meets these objectives. The board of directors of the combined company will be required to review the combined company\u2019s policies and procedures at least annually. The combined company will be required to report the results of its annual stress tests to the FRB, and it will be required to consider the results of the combined company\u2019s stress tests as part of its capital planning and risk management practices. Assuming the merger is consummated in the second half of 2016, the combined company is anticipated to be subject to the DFAST regime commencing on January 1, 2018, but well in advance of that date, the combined company will need to undertake the planning and other actions that it deems reasonably necessary to achieve timely compliance.\nIt is difficult to predict the overall compliance cost of these provisions, which will become effective (with a phase-in period) when the combined company surpasses $10 billion in consolidated assets as a result of the merger. However, compliance with these provisions will likely require additional staffing, engagement of external consultants and other operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on the future financial condition and results of operations of the combined company.", "PERMNO": 85741, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HOPE"}
