RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock involves risks. The investor should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding to make an investment decision regarding the Company\u2019s stock. The risk factors may cause future earnings to be lower or the financial condition to be less favorable than expected. In addition, other risks that the Company is not aware of, or which are not believed to be material, may cause earnings to be lower, or may deteriorate the financial condition of the Company. Consideration should also be given to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\nChanges in U.S. or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and in the local market area. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels, consumer confidence and spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the economy in the United States generally and in the Company\u2019s market area in particular. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. A return to elevated levels of unemployment, declines in the values of real estate, or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes could impair the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and reduce demand for banking products and services.\nThe geographic concentration of our operations makes the Company susceptible to downturns in local economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial and commercial real estate lending operations are concentrated in central Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington D. C. The Company\u2019s success depends in part upon economic conditions in these markets. Adverse changes in economic conditions in these markets could limit growth in loans and deposits, impair the Company\u2019s ability to collect amounts due on loans, increase problem loans and charge-offs and otherwise negatively affect performance and financial condition. Declines in real estate values could cause some of the residential and commercial real estate loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose the Company to a greater risk of loss in the event that the recovery on amounts due on defaulted loans is resolved by selling the real estate collateral.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our actual loan losses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAn allowance for loan losses is maintained in an amount that is believed to be adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The Company has an aggressive program to monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become non-performing, however, at any time there are loans included in the portfolio that will result in losses, but that have not been identified as non-performing or potential problem credits. There can be no assurance that the ability exists to identify all deteriorating credits prior to them becoming non-performing assets, or that the Company will have the ability to limit losses on those loans that are identified. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Additionally, future additions may be required based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers, or as a result of assumptions by management in determining the allowance. Additionally, banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from the Company\u2019s. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a negative effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nIf non-performing assets increase, earnings will be adversely impacted.\nAt December 31, 2016, non-performing assets, which are comprised of non-accrual loans, 90 days past due loans and other real estate owned, totaled $33.8 million, or 0.66%, of total assets, compared to non-performing assets of $37.2 million, or 0.80% of total assets at December 31, 2015. Non-performing assets adversely affect net income in various ways. Interest income is not recorded on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned. The Company must record a reserve for probable losses on loans, which is established through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses, and from time to time must write-down the value of properties in the Company\u2019s other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity. Finally, if the estimate for the recorded allowance for loan losses proves to be incorrect and the allowance is inadequate, the allowance will have to be increased and, as a result, Company earnings would be adversely affected. A downturn in the Company\u2019s market areas could increase credit risk associated with the loan portfolio, as it could have a material adverse effect on both the ability of borrowers to repay loans as well as the value of the real property or other property held as collateral for such loans. There can be no assurance that non-performing loans will not increase in the future, or that the Company\u2019s non-performing assets will not result in further losses in the future.\nThe Company may be subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgage loans.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold, it is customary to make representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require the repurchase or substitution of mortgage loans in the event the Company breaches any of these representations or warranties. In addition, there may be a requirement to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. The Company receives a limited number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers as a result of borrower fraud and early payment default of the borrower on mortgage loans. The Company has enhanced its underwriting policies and procedures, however, these steps may not be effective or reduce the risk associated with loans sold in the past. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase materially, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny delays in the Company\u2019s ability to foreclose on delinquent mortgage loans may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe origination of mortgage loans occurs with the expectation that if the borrower defaults then the ultimate loss is mitigated by the value of the collateral that secures the mortgage loan. The ability to mitigate the losses on defaulted loans depends upon the ability to promptly foreclose upon the collateral after an appropriate cure period. In some states, the large number of mortgage foreclosures that have occurred has resulted in delays in foreclosing. Any delay in the foreclosure process will adversely affect the Company by increasing the expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and exposes the Company to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect earnings and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s net income depends to a great extent upon the level of net interest income. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease net interest income and net income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investments, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in market interest rates, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.\nChanges in market interest rates are affected by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including inflation, unemployment, money supply, international events, and events in world financial markets. The Company attempts to manage its risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, re-pricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, but interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the net interest margin and results of operations. Changes in the market interest rates for types of products and services in various markets also may vary significantly from location to location and over time based upon competition and local or regional economic factors. At December 31, 2016, the Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity simulation model projected that net interest income would decrease by 2.84% if interest rates immediately rose by 200 basis points. The results of an interest rate sensitivity simulation model depend upon a number of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nThe Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio is subject to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.\nThe investment securities portfolio has risk factors beyond the Company\u2019s control that may significantly influence its fair value. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults of the issuers of the securities, lack of market pricing of the securities, and instability in the credit markets. Lack of market activity with respect to some securities has, in certain circumstances, required the Company to base its fair market valuation on unobservable inputs. Any changes in these risk factors, in current accounting principles or interpretations of these principles could impact the Company\u2019s assessment of fair value and thus the determination of other-than-temporary impairment of the securities in the investment securities portfolio. Investment securities that previously were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired could require further write-downs due to continued erosion of the creditworthiness of the issuer. Write-downs of investment securities would negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings and regulatory capital ratios.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risks.\nMarket conditions could negatively affect the level or cost of available liquidity, which would affect the Company\u2019s ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. Core deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances are the Company\u2019s primary source of funding. A significant decrease in the core deposits, an inability to renew Federal Home Loan Bank advances, an inability to obtain alternative funding to core deposits or Federal Home Loan Bank advances, or a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings.\nAt December 31, 2016, goodwill totaled $85.8 million. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. There could be a requirement to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the normal annual assessment if there is a disruption in the Company\u2019s business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future, which would adversely affect the results of operations. A goodwill impairment charge does not adversely affect regulatory capital ratios or tangible capital. Based on an analysis, it was determined that the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units exceeded the carrying value of their assets and liabilities and, therefore, goodwill was not considered impaired at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company depends on its executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of its long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nThe Company believes that its continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of its management team and its ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. In particular, the Company relies on the leadership of its Chief Executive Officer, Daniel J. Schrider. The loss of service of Mr. Schrider or one or more of the Company\u2019s other executive officers or key personnel could reduce the Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement its long-term business strategy, its business could suffer and the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and the Company cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether the Company will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. The Company believes its management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and the Company\u2019s markets and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have entered into employment agreements with the Company, it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. The Company\u2019s success also depends on the experience of its branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact the Company\u2019s banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results.\nThe market price for the Company\u2019s stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated, ranging between $24.36 and $40.64 per share during the 12 months ended December 31, 2016. The overall market and the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may experience volatility. There may be a significant impact on the market price for the common stock due to, among other things:\n\u00b7 past and future dividend practice;\n\u00b7 financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results or the quality of the Company\u2019s assets;\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 changes in expectations as to the future financial performance;\n\u00b7 announcements of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions and other material events by the Company or its competitors;\n\u00b7 the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to the Company;\n\u00b7 future sales of the Company\u2019s equity or equity-related securities;\n\u00b7 the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n\u00b7 changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility or other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events.\nThere can be no assurance that a more active or consistent trading market in the Company\u2019s common stock will develop. As a result, relatively small trades could have a significant impact on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe cost savings that the Company estimates for mergers and acquisitions may not be realized.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s mergers and acquisitions may depend, in part, on the ability to realize the estimated cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with the Company\u2019s existing operations. It is possible that the potential cost savings could turn out to be more difficult to achieve than anticipated. The cost savings estimates also depend on the ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized. If the estimates turn out to be incorrect or there is an inability to combine successfully, the anticipated cost savings may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nCombining acquired businesses with the Company may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than expected, or could result in the loss of customers.\nIt is possible that the process of merger integration of acquired companies could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or acquisition. There also may be disruptions that cause the Company to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits. Customers may not readily accept changes to their banking arrangements or other customer relationships after the merger or acquisition.\nMarket competition may decrease the Company\u2019s growth or profits.\nThe Company competes for loans, deposits, and investment dollars with other banks and other financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers, and private lenders, many of which have substantially greater resources than possessed by the Company. Credit unions have federal tax exemptions, which may allow them to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than taxpaying financial institutions such as commercial banks. In addition, non-depository institution competitors are generally not subject to the extensive regulation applicable to institutions that offer federally insured deposits. Other institutions may have other competitive advantages in particular markets or may be willing to accept lower profit margins on certain products. These differences in resources, regulation, competitive advantages, and business strategy may decrease the Company\u2019s net interest margin, increase the Company\u2019s operating costs, and may make it harder to compete profitably.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry, and compliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations that govern its operations may adversely affect the Company.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance funds and depositors, not shareholders. Sandy Spring Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and by Maryland banking authorities. Sandy Spring Bancorp is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The burdens imposed by federal and state regulations put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies, and leasing companies. Changes in the laws, regulations, and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect the Company and create competitive advantages for others. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, and the Company cannot predict the ultimate effect of these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. Federal economic and monetary policy may also affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract deposits and other funding sources, make loans and investments, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by law.\nThe ability to pay dividends to shareholders largely depends on Sandy Spring Bancorp\u2019s receipt of dividends from Sandy Spring Bank. The amount of dividends that Sandy Spring Bank may pay to Sandy Spring Bancorp is limited by federal laws and regulations. The ability of Sandy Spring Bank to pay dividends is also subject to its profitability, financial condition and cash flow requirements. There is no assurance that Sandy Spring Bank will be able to pay dividends to Sandy Spring Bancorp in the future. The decision may be made to limit the payment of dividends even when the legal ability to pay them exists, in order to retain earnings for other uses.\nRestrictions on unfriendly acquisitions could prevent a takeover of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage takeover attempts that are not approved by the board of directors. The Maryland General Corporation Law includes provisions that make an acquisition of the Company more difficult. These provisions may prevent a future takeover attempt in which the shareholders otherwise might receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices.\nThese provisions include supermajority provisions for the approval of certain business combinations and certain provisions relating to meetings of shareholders. The Company\u2019s articles of incorporation also authorize the issuance of additional shares without shareholder approval on terms or in circumstances that could deter a future takeover attempt.\nFuture sales of the Company\u2019s common stock or other securities may dilute the value and adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn many situations, the board of directors has the authority, without any vote of the Company\u2019s shareholders, to issue shares of authorized but unissued stock, including shares authorized and unissued under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans. In the future, additional securities may be issued, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital. Any such issuance would dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, option holders may exercise their options at a time when the Company would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms.\nAny changes in the Federal or State tax laws may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax law that could increase the effective tax rate payable to the state or federal government. These law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result, could negatively affect the current and future financial performance of the Company.\nChanges in accounting standards or interpretation of new or existing standards may affect how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change accounting regulations and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, bank regulators and the\noutside independent auditors may revise their previous interpretations regarding existing accounting regulations and the application of these accounting standards. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how to record and report the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, there could be a requirement to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nNew capital rules that became effective in 2015 and 2016 generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule for the Basel III capital framework. These rules substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The rules apply to the Company as well as to Sandy Spring Bank. Beginning in 2015, our minimum capital requirements are (i) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (common Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). Our leverage ratio requirement remains at the 4% level previously required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer began to phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required common Tier 1 equity ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nThe Company faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \"PATRIOT Act\") and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes that the Company uses to estimate its inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on its financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models that the Company uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models that the Company uses for determining its probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models that the Company uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Company\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems, misappropriation of funds, and theft of proprietary Company or customer data. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nThe reliance of the Company on third party vendors could expose it to additional cyber risk and liability.\nThe operation of our business involves outsourcing of certain business functions and reliance on third-party providers, which may result in transmission and maintenance of personal, confidential, and proprietary information to and by such vendors. Although we require third-party providers to maintain certain levels of information security, such providers remain vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious attacks that could ultimately compromise sensitive information possessed by our company. Although we contract to limit our liability in connection with attacks against third-party providers, the company remains exposed to risk of loss associated with such vendors.\nThe Company outsources certain aspects of its data processing to certain third-party providers which may expose it to additional risk.\nWe outsource certain key aspects of our data processing to certain third-party providers. While we have selected these third-party providers carefully, we cannot control their actions. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, including those which result from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Replacing these third-party providers could also entail significant delay and expense.\nOur third-party providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-party providers and their personnel. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nThe Company is dependent on its information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including online over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Further, we outsource some of the data processing functions used for remote banking, and accordingly we are dependent on the expertise and performance of our third-party providers. To the extent that our activities, the activities of our customers, or the activities of our third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.", "PERMNO": 83414, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SASR"}
