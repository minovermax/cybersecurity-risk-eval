RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our operations. Set forth below are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results and expectations contained in this report. Additional risks we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to complete a project in a timely manner, miss a required performance standard, or otherwise fail to adequately perform on a project, then we may incur a loss on that project, which may reduce or eliminate our overall profitability.\nOur engagements often involve large-scale, complex projects. The quality of our performance on such projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage the relationship with our clients and our ability to effectively manage the project and deploy appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel, in a timely manner. We may commit to a client that we will complete a project by a scheduled date or that, when completed, a project will achieve specified performance standards. If the project is not completed by the scheduled date or fails to meet required performance standards, we may either incur significant additional costs or be held responsible for the costs incurred by the client to rectify damages due to late completion or failure to achieve the required performance standards. The uncertainty of the timing of a project can present difficulties in planning the amount of personnel needed for the project. If the project is delayed or canceled, we may bear the cost of an underutilized workforce that was dedicated to fulfilling the project. In addition, performance of projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including unavoidable delays from government inaction, public opposition, inability to obtain financing, weather conditions, unavailability of vendor materials, changes in the project scope of services requested by our clients, industrial accidents, environmental hazards, and labor disruptions. To the extent these events occur, the total costs of the project could exceed our estimates, and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, incur a loss on a project, which may reduce or eliminate our overall profitability. Further, any defects or errors, or failures to meet our clients' expectations, could result in claims for damages against us. Failure to meet performance standards or complete performance on a timely basis could also adversely affect our reputation.\nA further downturn in public and private sector construction activity in the regions we serve, or other conditions that impact the construction industry, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA further downturn in construction activity in our geographic service areas may affect demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. During fiscal year 2014, a portion of our contract revenue was generated by services rendered to public agencies in connection with private and public sector construction projects.\nIn the recent past, general economic conditions declined due to a number of factors including slower economic activity, a lack of available credit, decreased consumer confidence and reduced corporate profits and capital spending, leading to a slowdown in construction, particularly residential housing construction, in the western United States. As a result of this slowdown, both our engineering services segment and public finance services segment suffered declines in revenue and operating margin compression and we made several reductions in workforce and facility leases. While economic conditions have improved from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014, the recovery has been slow with regard to our traditional engineering and public finance services segments. If the economy declines again, we will need to evaluate whether reductions in headcount and facilities in geographic areas that are underperforming are again needed.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may also be adversely affected by conditions that impact the construction sector in general, including, among other things:\n\u2022 Changes in national and local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics;\n\u2022 Slow-growth or no-growth initiatives or legislation;\n\u2022 Adverse changes in local and regional governmental policies on investment in infrastructure;\n\u2022 Adverse changes in federal and state policies regarding the allocation of funds to local and regional agencies;\n\u2022 The impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 Changes in real estate tax rates and assessments;\n\u2022 Increases in interest rates and changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing;\n\u2022 Adverse changes in other governmental rules and fiscal policies; and\n\u2022 Earthquakes and other natural disasters, which can cause uninsured losses, and other factors which are beyond our control.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the local and regional economies of California and New York could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse economic and other conditions affecting the local and regional economies of California and New York may reduce the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During fiscal year 2014, approximately 57% and 32% of our contract revenue was derived from services rendered to public agencies, utilities, and private industry in California and New York, respectively. California and New York each experienced an economic downturn in fiscal year 2009, which negatively impacted our revenue and profitability and continues to negatively impact revenues in our Engineering Services and Public Finance Services segments. Any future downturns could have similar significant adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nReductions in state and local government budgets could negatively impact their capital spending and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeveral of our state and local government clients are currently facing budget deficits, resulting in smaller budgets and reduced capital spending, which has negatively impacted our revenue and\nprofitability. Our state and local government clients may continue to face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding new or existing projects. In addition, existing and potential clients may either postpone entering into new contracts or request price concessions. If we are not able to reduce our costs quickly enough to respond to the revenue decline from these clients that may occur, our operating results would be adversely affected. Accordingly, these factors affect our ability to accurately forecast our future revenue and earnings from business areas that may be adversely impacted by market conditions.\nBecause we primarily provide services to municipalities, public utilities and other public agencies, we are more susceptible to the unique risks associated with government contracts.\nWe primarily work for municipalities, public utilities and other public agencies. Consequently, we are exposed to certain risks associated with government contracting, any one of which can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These risks include:\n\u2022 The ability of the public agency to terminate the contract with 30 days' prior notice or less;\n\u2022 Changes in government spending and fiscal policies which can have an adverse effect on demand for our services;\n\u2022 Contracts that are subject to government budget cycles, and often are subject to renewal on an annual basis;\n\u2022 The often wide variation of the types and pricing terms of contracts from agency to agency;\n\u2022 The difficulty of obtaining change orders and additions to contracts; and\n\u2022 The requirement to perform periodic audits as a condition of certain contract arrangements.\nEach year, client funding for some of our government contracts may rely on government appropriations or public-supported financing. If adequate public funding is delayed or is not available, then our profits and revenue could decline.\nEach year, client funding for some of our government contracts may directly or indirectly rely on government appropriations or public-supported financing. Legislatures may appropriate funds for a given project on a year-by-year basis, even though the project may take more than one year to perform. In addition, public-supported financing such as state and local municipal bonds may be only partially raised to support existing projects. Similarly, the impact of the economic downturn on state and local governments may make it more difficult for them to fund projects. In addition to the state of the economy and competing political priorities, public funds and the timing of payment of these funds may be influenced by, among other things, curtailments in the use of government contracting firms, increases in raw material costs, delays associated with insufficient numbers of government staff to oversee contracts, budget constraints, the timing and amount of tax receipts, and the overall level of government expenditures. If adequate public funding is not available or is delayed, then our profits and revenue could decline.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders, which may impact our ability to execute on our current or future business strategies.\nWe anticipate that our current cash, cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and borrowing ability under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes during the next 12 months. It is possible, however, that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise, we may need additional financing to execute on our current or future business strategies, including hiring additional personnel, developing new or enhancing existing service lines, expanding our business geographically, enhancing our operating infrastructure, acquiring complementary businesses, or otherwise responding to competitive pressures. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, meet obligations in the normal course of business, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited.\nWe depend on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our business.\nOur largest client, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, accounted for approximately 25% of our consolidated contract revenue in fiscal year 2014 and 16% in fiscal year 2013. Prior to July 2012, this revenue primarily related to a contract we entered into in fiscal year 2009 with Consolidated Edison, which has terminated. We entered into a new contract with Consolidated Edison in July 2012, but this contract is for fewer services than the 2009 contract with Consolidated Edison. Our top five customers collectively accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue in fiscal year 2014. The loss of, or reduction in orders from, these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements, which may significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.\nTo prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. For example, we typically recognize revenue of our fixed price contracts over the life of a contract based on the proportion of costs incurred to date compared to the total costs estimated to be incurred for the entire project. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:\n\u2022 the application of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting and revenue recognition on contracts, change orders, and contract claims, including related unbilled accounts receivable;\n\u2022 unbilled accounts receivable, including amounts related to requests for equitable adjustment to contracts that provide for price redetermination, primarily with the U.S. federal government. These amounts are recorded only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable;\n\u2022 provisions for uncollectible receivables, client claims, and recoveries of costs from subcontractors, vendors, and others;\n\u2022 provisions for income taxes, valuation allowances, and unrecognized tax benefits;\n\u2022 value of goodwill and recoverability of other intangible assets;\n\u2022 valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\n\u2022 valuation of contingent earn-out liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations;\n\u2022 valuation of stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022 accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from those estimates, which may significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.\nOur profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain adequate utilization of our workforce.\nThe cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. The rate at which we utilize our workforce is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and assimilate new employees;\n\u2022 our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces;\n\u2022 our ability to manage attrition;\n\u2022 our need to devote time and resources to training, business development, professional development, and other non-chargeable activities; and\n\u2022 our ability to match the skill sets of our employees to the needs of the marketplace.\nIf we over-utilize our workforce, our employees may become disengaged, which could impact employee attrition. If we under-utilize our workforce, our profit margin and profitability could suffer.\nLegislation may be enacted that limits the ability of state, regional or local agencies to contract for our privatized services. Such legislation would affect our ability to obtain new contracts and may decrease the demand for our services.\nLegislation is proposed periodically, particularly in the state of California, that attempts to limit the ability of governmental agencies to contract with private consultants to provide services. Should such legislation pass and be upheld, demand for our services may be materially adversely affected. During fiscal year 2014, approximately 57% of our contract revenue was derived from services rendered to public agencies, including public utilities, in California. While attempts at such legislation have failed in the past, such measures could be adopted in the future.\nState and other public employee unions may bring litigation that seeks to limit the ability of public agencies to contract with private firms to perform government employee functions in the area of public improvements. Judicial determinations in favor of these unions could affect our ability to compete for contracts and may have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nFor more than 20 years, state and other public employee unions have challenged the validity of propositions, legislation, charters and other government regulations that allow public agencies to contract with private firms to provide services in the fields of engineering, design and construction of public improvements that might otherwise be provided by public employees. These challenges could have the effect of eliminating, or severely restricting, the ability of municipalities to hire private firms for the purpose of designing and constructing public improvements, and otherwise require them to use union employees to perform the services.\nFor example, the Professional Engineers in California Government, or PECG, a union representing state civil service employees, began challenging Caltrans' hiring of private firms in 1986, and in 2002 began a judicial challenge of Caltrans' hiring practices based on Caltrans' interpretation of the effect of Proposition 35 (Professional Engineers in California Government, et al. v. Kempton). The California Supreme Court ruled in favor of Caltrans, concluding that Caltrans may hire private contractors to\nperform architectural and engineering services on public works. Although Caltrans was successful in this litigation, similar claims may be brought in the future and we cannot predict their outcome. If a state or other public employee union is successful in its challenge and as a result the ability of state agencies to hire private firms is severely limited, such a decision would likely lead to additional litigation challenging the ability of the state, counties, municipalities and other public agencies to hire private engineering, architectural and other firms, the outcome of which could affect our ability to compete for contracts and may have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nChanges in elected or appointed officials could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain an existing contract with or obtain additional contracts from a public agency.\nSince the decision to retain our services is made by individuals, such as city managers, city councils and other elected or appointed officials, our business and financial results or condition could be adversely affected by the results of local and regional elections. A change in the individuals responsible for selecting consultants for and awarding contracts on behalf of a public agency due to an election could adversely affect our ability to retain an existing contract with or obtain additional contracts from such public agency.\nFixed price contracts under which we perform some of our services impose risks to our ability to maintain or grow our profitability.\nIn fiscal year 2014, approximately 42% of our contract revenue was derived from fixed price contracts. Under fixed price contracts, we perform services under a contract at a stipulated price which protects clients but exposes us to a greater number of risks than time-and-materials and unit-based contracts. These risks include:\n\u2022 Underestimation of costs;\n\u2022 Ambiguities in specifications;\n\u2022 Problems with new technologies;\n\u2022 Unforeseen costs or difficulties;\n\u2022 Failures of subcontractors;\n\u2022 Delays beyond our control; and\n\u2022 Economic and other changes that may occur during the contract period.\nThe occurrence of any such risk could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur use of the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition on our fixed price contracts could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue and profits.\nWe account for our fixed price contracts on the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition. Generally, our use of this method results in recognition of revenue and profit ratably over the life of the contract, based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to total costs expected to be incurred for the entire project. The effects of revisions to revenue and estimated costs, including the achievement of award fees and the impact of change orders and claims, are recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any period and their effects could be material. Although we have historically made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion of long-term contracts, the uncertainties inherent in the estimating process make it possible for actual costs to vary materially from estimates, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profit.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our business and operating results. Our failure to conduct due diligence effectively, or our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of the acquisitions, which could weaken our results of operations.\nA key part of our growth strategy, as shown by our January 2015 acquisitions discussed below under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Recent Developments,\" is to acquire other companies that complement our lines of business or that broaden our technical capabilities and geographic presence. We may continue to acquire companies as an element of our growth strategy; however, our ability to make acquisitions is restricted under our amended credit agreement. Acquisitions involve certain known and unknown risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts. For example:\n\u2022 we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to acquire additional companies on acceptable terms;\n\u2022 we compete with others to acquire companies, which may result in decreased availability of, or increased price for, suitable acquisition candidates;\n\u2022 we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing, on favorable terms or at all, to finance any of our potential acquisitions;\n\u2022 we may ultimately fail to consummate an acquisition even if we announce that we plan to acquire a company; and\n\u2022 acquired companies may not perform as we expect, and we may fail to realize anticipated revenue and profits.\nOur acquisition strategy may divert management's attention away from our existing businesses, resulting in the loss of key clients or key employees, and expose us to unanticipated problems or legal liabilities, including responsibility as a successor-in-interest for undisclosed or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses or assets.\nIf we fail to conduct due diligence on our potential targets effectively, we may, for example, not identify problems at target companies, or fail to recognize incompatibilities or other obstacles to successful integration. Our inability to successfully integrate future acquisitions could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of those acquisitions and could severely weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, may preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the combining companies may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, and competitive responses, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of integrating an acquisition include, among others:\n\u2022 issues in integrating information, communications, and other systems;\n\u2022 incompatibility of logistics, marketing, and administration methods;\n\u2022 maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u2022 integrating the business cultures of both companies;\n\u2022 preserving important strategic client relationships;\n\u2022 consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures, and eliminating duplicative operations; and\n\u2022 coordinating and integrating geographically separate organizations.\nEven if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nFurther, acquisitions may cause us to:\n\u2022 issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders' ownership percentage;\n\u2022 use a substantial portion of our cash resources;\n\u2022 increase our interest expense, leverage, and debt service requirements (if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition);\n\u2022 assume liabilities, including environmental liabilities, for which we do not have indemnification from the former owners. Further, indemnification obligations may be subject to dispute or concerns regarding the creditworthiness of the former owners;\n\u2022 record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges;\n\u2022 experience volatility in earnings due to changes in contingent consideration related to acquisition earn-out liability estimates;\n\u2022 incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u2022 lose existing or potential contracts as a result of conflict of interest issues;\n\u2022 incur large and immediate write-offs; or\n\u2022 become subject to litigation.\nIf we are not able to successfully manage our growth strategy, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur expected future growth presents numerous managerial, administrative, operational, and other challenges. Our ability to manage the growth of our operations will require us to continue to improve our management information systems and our other internal systems and controls. In addition, our growth will increase our need to attract, develop, motivate, and retain both our management and professional employees. The inability to effectively manage our growth or the inability of our employees to achieve anticipated performance could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in the perceived risk of acts of terrorism or natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our Homeland Security Services business.\nIf there is a significant decrease in the perceived risk of the likelihood that one or more acts of terrorism will be conducted in the United States, or a significant decrease in the perceived risk of the occurrence of natural disasters, our ability to grow and generate revenue through our Homeland Security Services segment, could be negatively affected. Our Homeland Security Services segment provides training and consulting services to local and regional agencies related to preparing for and responding to incidents of terrorism and natural disaster. Should the perceived risk of such incidence decline, federal and state funding for homeland security and emergency preparedness could be reduced, which might decrease demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and otherwise conduct our business effectively.\nAs primarily a professional and technical services company, we are labor-intensive and, therefore, our ability to attract, retain, and expand our senior management and our professional and technical staff is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for qualified engineers is competitive and, from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the required expertise within the timeframe demanded by our clients. In addition, we rely heavily upon the expertise and leadership of our senior management. If we are unable to retain executives and other key personnel, the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled, which may require that we devote time and resources to identify, hire, and integrate new employees. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could adversely affect our business. We do not maintain key-man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or senior managers. Our failure to attract and retain key individuals could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and conduct our business effectively.\nWe operate in a highly fragmented industry, and we may not be able to compete effectively with our larger competitors.\nThe market for energy efficiency, engineering and planning, economic and financial consulting and national preparedness and interoperability services is competitive and highly fragmented. Contract awards are based primarily on quality of service, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, reputation, geographic presence, stability and price. Some of our competitors in certain service areas have more personnel and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. In particular, our energy efficiency and sustainability consulting services, which represented approximately 49% and 42% of our contract revenue for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, competes with larger energy efficiency consulting firms such as Lockheed-Martin, EnerPath, KEMA (a division of the DNV Group) and Nexant, Inc. Our competitors for engineering related services, which represented approximately 38% and 41% of our contract revenue for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, include many larger consulting firms such as Charles Abbott & Associates, Inc., Bureau Veritas, Harris & Associates, Psomas, RBF Consulting, Tetra Tech, Inc., Stantec, Inc., Michael Baker Corporation, TRC Companies, Inc., AECOM Technology Corporation, CH2M Hill and Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. In certain public finance consulting services, we may compete with large accounting firms. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future with these or other competitors.\nOur services may expose us to liability in excess of our current insurance coverage, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nOur services involve significant risks of professional and other liabilities, which may substantially exceed the fees we derive from our services. In addition, from time to time, we assume liabilities as a result of indemnification provisions contained in our service contracts. We cannot predict the magnitude of these potential liabilities.\nWe currently maintain the following insurance coverage: commercial general liability with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million general aggregate; automobile liability insurance with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence; employer's liability with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence. We also carry professional liability insurance with limits of $5.0 million per claim and $10.0 million annual aggregate and excess liability insurance with a limit of $10.0 million. We are liable to pay these claims from our assets if and when the aggregate settlement or judgment amount exceeds our policy limits. We are liable to pay claims from our assets if and when the aggregate settlement or judgment amount exceeds our policy limits. Our professional liability policy is a \"claims made\" policy. Thus, only claims made during the term of the policy are covered. If we terminate our professional liability policy and do not obtain retroactive coverage, we would be uninsured for claims made after termination even if these\nclaims are based on events or acts that occurred during the term of the policy. Further, our insurance may not protect us against liability because our policies typically have various exceptions to the claims covered and also require us to assume some costs of the claim even though a portion of the claim may be covered. In addition, if we expand into new markets, we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage for these new activities or, if insurance is obtained, the dollar amount of any liabilities incurred could exceed our insurance coverage. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nWe often rely on subcontractors. The quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts would be adversely affected if qualified subcontractors are unavailable for us to engage.\nUnder some of our contracts, we rely on the efforts and skills of subcontractors for the performance of some of the tasks. Subcontractor services and other direct costs comprised approximately 33% of our contract revenue in fiscal year 2014. Our use of subcontractors has decreased in recent years primarily because our subsidiary Willdan Energy Solutions has reduced its utilization of subcontractors. Our subsidiary Willdan Energy Solutions generally utilizes a higher percentage of subcontractors than our other subsidiaries. The absence of qualified subcontractors with whom we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service offerings and therefore our financial results. Additionally, we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or client concerns about the subcontractor.\nIf our contractors and subcontractors fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our revenue, profitability, and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on contractors and subcontractors in conducting our business. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, client concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract. In addition, if a subcontractor fails to deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies, fails to perform the agreed-upon services, or goes out of business, then we may be required to purchase the services or supplies from another source at a higher price, and our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized. This may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services or supplies are needed.\nWe also rely on relationships with other contractors when we act as their subcontractor or joint venture partner. The absence of qualified subcontractors with which we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts. Our future revenue and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their subcontracts or teaming arrangement relationships with us, or if a government agency terminates or reduces these other contractors' programs, does not award them new contracts, or refuses to pay under a contract.\nIf our reports and opinions are not in compliance with professional standards and other regulations, we could be subject to monetary damages and penalties.\nWe issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise, as well as our other professional credentials. Our reports and opinions may need to comply with professional standards, licensing requirements, securities regulations, and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction in which the services are performed. In addition, we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports or opinions even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. For example, if we deliver an inaccurate report or\none that is not in compliance with the relevant standards, and that report is made available to a third party, we could be subject to third-party liability, resulting in monetary damages and penalties.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company such as more costly director and officer liability insurance and legal and financial compliance costs. If new rules and regulations for public companies are put in place, our compliance costs may increase further and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nChanges in resource management, environmental, or infrastructure industry laws, regulations, and programs could directly or indirectly reduce the demand for our services, which could in turn negatively impact our revenue.\nSome of our services are directly or indirectly impacted by changes in U.S. federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations pertaining to the resource management, environmental, and infrastructure industries. Accordingly, a relaxation or repeal of these laws and regulations, or changes in governmental policies regarding the funding, implementation or enforcement of these programs, could result in a decline in demand for our services, which could in turn negatively impact our revenue.\nForce majeure events, including natural disasters and terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate or disrupt our operations, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nForce majeure or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters, as well as terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate by causing the closure of offices, interrupting projects, and forcing the relocation of employees. We typically remain obligated to perform our services after a terrorist action or natural disaster unless the contract contains a force majeure clause that relieves us of our contractual obligations in such an extraordinary event. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure, our operations may be affected significantly, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. We rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property where we do not believe that patent or copyright protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. In addition, if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nSystems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate.\nWe rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and systems to operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays. If we are unable to effectively deploy software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take steps to improve and protect our systems, systems operations could be interrupted or delayed.\nOur computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, and similar events or disruptions. In addition, we face the threat of unauthorized system access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks, and other security breaches and system disruptions. We devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to threats.
