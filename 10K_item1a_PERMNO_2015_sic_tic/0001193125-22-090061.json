As a result, investing in the Company\u2019s common stock involves substantial risk. The Company\u2019s stockholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, as well as the other information we file with the SEC from time to time. If any of these risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider to be immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain statements made in this section constitute \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including those described in this section. For additional information, refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d within this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur current business is highly dependent on the United capacity purchase agreement because United is currently Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner. If United does not agree to extend the agreement or enter into a new agreement, or if the agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, our business would be significantly negatively impacted.\nWe derive nearly all of our operating revenues from the United capacity purchase agreement because United is currently Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner. United accounted for approximately 99.9% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The United capacity purchase agreement expires in February 2023. The parties are in active negotiations regarding the extension of the agreement or the execution of a new agreement. However, neither party is under any obligation to enter into a new or extended agreement, and we can provide no assurance that any new or extended agreement will be reached.\nPursuant to the United capacity purchase agreement, United is permitted to terminate the agreement prior to the expiration of the term in certain circumstances, including upon Air Wisconsin\u2019s material breach of the agreement, Air Wisconsin\u2019s controllable completion factor falling below pre-determined\nlevels for a period of at least four consecutive months, a non-carrier-specific\ngrounding of at least a specified number of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, and certain changes of control of Air Wisconsin. No such termination event has occurred or exists as of the date of this filing. If United does not agree to enter into a new capacity purchase agreement, or if a termination event occurs and United exercises its right to terminate the agreement in accordance with its terms, our business would be significantly negatively impacted. A termination or expiration of this agreement would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, unless we are able to enter into satisfactory substitute arrangements for the utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft. We may not be able to enter into substitute arrangements, and any arrangements we are able to secure may not be as favorable to us as the current agreement.\nAny events that negatively impact the financial or operating performance of United could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, during the COVID-19\npandemic, United has experienced a significant decline in flight demand and revenues. While there has been a modest demand recovery, this reduction in demand as compared to 2019 levels is expected to continue at least through 2022, which we expect will continue to negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s scheduled block hours. In addition, United may be materially and adversely impacted, directly or indirectly, by worldwide political or economic changes or instability, including those associated with the outbreak of war or hostilities, government sanctions, travel restrictions, rising fuel and other commodity prices, currency exchange rate fluctuations and increasing interest rates. If United were to experience significant financial difficulties as a result of these or other reasons, it could negatively impact United\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations under the United capacity purchase agreement and potentially alter its business strategy as it applies to regional airlines. Further, if United were to become bankrupt, the United capacity purchase agreement may not be assumed in bankruptcy and could be terminated, and such termination would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAir Wisconsin may experience difficulty hiring, training and retaining a sufficient number of qualified pilots and mechanics, which may negatively affect Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and our financial condition.\nHistorically, the supply of qualified pilots to the airline industry has been limited, which has created difficulty hiring, training and retaining a sufficient number of qualified pilots. In July 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration (the \u201cFAA\u201d) issued stringent pilot qualification and crew member flight training standards, which increased the required training time for new airline pilots (the \u201cFAA Qualification Standards\u201d), and the FAA also mandated stricter rules to minimize pilot fatigue, increasing the number of pilots required to be employed for Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and correspondingly increasing Air Wisconsin\u2019s labor costs.\nAs a result of the significant decline in passenger demand and drastically reduced flight departures during the early stage of the COVID-19\npandemic, there was no shortage of qualified pilots in the airline industry. During the first two years of the COVID-19\npandemic, for many reasons, such as reduced flying opportunities, travel restrictions and COVID-19\nvaccine mandates, many pilots decided to retire or seek employment in other industries. However, as passenger demand for air travel has increased, Air Wisconsin has experienced challenges hiring and maintaining sufficient numbers of qualified pilots due to a number of factors, including the increased flight hour requirements under the FAA Qualification Standards, the statutory mandatory retirement age of 65, and attrition resulting from voluntary retirement decisions. Air Wisconsin has also experienced challenges with pilot attrition to other airlines. Air Wisconsin has historically expended significant resources to recruit and train pilots, including as a result of upward pressure on pilot compensation and limited availability of flight simulators and instructors, and Air Wisconsin may experience additional cost increases in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nAir Wisconsin has also recently experienced difficulty hiring and retaining qualified mechanics to service its aircraft, due to a variety of factors, including voluntary retirement decisions, decisions not to return after furloughs during the COVID-19\npandemic, and the hiring needs of other airlines. There is also a risk that some mechanics may have decided to leave the airline industry or may decide to do so in the future. If Air Wisconsin is unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified mechanics, it could have an adverse impact on its business and operations.\nThere is also a risk that Air Wisconsin would lose employees, including additional pilots and mechanics, if a COVID-19\nvaccine mandate were imposed by any federal, state or local government authority. If future pilot or mechanic attrition rates outpace Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to hire and retain qualified pilots and mechanics, Air Wisconsin may need to increase its labor costs to attract and retain sufficient qualified pilots and mechanics or it may be unable to fly the number of flights required under the United capacity purchase agreement, which may result in penalties under the agreement that would negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and our financial condition.\nDisagreements regarding the interpretation of the United capacity purchase agreement, as well as other business disputes with United, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, and negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s relationship with United.\nLong-term contractual agreements, such as the United capacity purchase agreement, are subject to interpretation, and disputes may arise if the parties apply different interpretations to the agreements. Currently, a dispute exists under the United capacity purchase agreement with respect to certain amounts owed to Air Wisconsin by United. We cannot predict the outcome of the dispute. Failure to resolve this dispute could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our relationship with United which, in turn, could impact the negotiation of an extension to the United capacity purchase agreement or the execution of a new agreement with United.\nTo the extent Air Wisconsin experiences additional disagreements with United regarding the interpretation of the United capacity purchase agreement or otherwise, Air Wisconsin would be required to expend additional management time and financial resources to resolve them. Those disagreements may result in litigation, arbitration, settlement negotiations or other proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of disputes which may arise in the future on the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement or any future agreement we may enter into with United. An unfavorable result of a future dispute with United could require Air Wisconsin to modify the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement, enter into a new agreement with United, or change its business strategy, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf United reduces or discontinues its use of single class 50-seat\naircraft, Air Wisconsin\u2019s opportunities for growth with United may be limited, and it may be difficult to enter into substitute arrangements with another airline.\nIn June 2021, United announced that its long-term fleet strategy involves significantly reducing, but not eliminating, the use of single class 50-seat\naircraft, which includes the CRJ-200\nregional jet comprising the Air Wisconsin fleet. According to United, its new fleet strategy would reduce single class 50-seat\naircraft flight departures from 33% of United\u2019s total departures down to approximately 10% by 2026. Although United has reduced its fleet of single class 50 seat aircraft through actions it has taken with other regional airlines, such as ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. and Trans States Airlines, it is possible that United might not agree to extend the United capacity purchase agreement, or enter into a new agreement, as part of its fleet planning process. If the agreement is not extended or a new agreement is not entered into, our business would be significantly impacted, and it is unlikely we would have an immediate source of revenues or earnings to offset the financial impact. Alternatively, United could agree to extend the agreement, but on terms materially different from the current agreement. American Airlines has also announced that it intends to significantly reduce the single class 50-seat\naircraft in its fleet, and Delta Airlines has announced that it intends to retire all of the single class 50-seat\naircraft in its fleet. Therefore, Air Wisconsin may not be able to enter into substitute arrangements with other airlines, and any arrangements it is able to secure may not be as favorable to us as the current United capacity purchase agreement. Since our primary business strategy currently involves flying single class 50-seat\naircraft, the publicly announced fleet strategy changes by several major carriers, including Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner, represent a substantial risk to our business.\nIf United provides Air Wisconsin with inefficient flight schedules, or makes certain changes to the expected utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft under the United capacity purchase agreement, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement, United has the ability to schedule Air Wisconsin\u2019s flights in any manner that serves United\u2019s purposes, subject to certain reasonable operating constraints which do not prevent United from scheduling Air Wisconsin\u2019s flights in a manner Air Wisconsin deems inefficient. From time to time, United schedules Air Wisconsin\u2019s flights in a manner that creates operational inefficiencies for Air Wisconsin, such as by building in long crew layovers or overnights, which can cause crew staffing issues and result in limited crew availability to fly other scheduled Air Wisconsin flights, or by providing Air Wisconsin with flight schedules that are inconsistent with Air Wisconsin\u2019s existing operational footprint. These actions have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain factors have led, and may in the future lead, United to modify the anticipated utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft under the United capacity purchase agreement, some of which are beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control. Any factors that continue to cause United to schedule the utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft on routes or at frequencies materially different than we have forecasted could further reduce our ability to realize operating efficiencies, which would continue to negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. United has stated that it does not expect the recovery from the COVID-19\npandemic to follow a linear path and, as such, the actual number of flights United schedules under the United capacity purchase agreement in any particular period may be significantly different from the number of flights we initially anticipated or which United initially communicated for the period.\nAir Wisconsin\u2019s current growth opportunities, strategic operating plan and future growth opportunities may be limited by the United capacity purchase agreement or a number of factors impacting the airline industry.\nIn addition to the fleet strategy changes discussed above, growth opportunities within United\u2019s current flight network may be limited by various factors, including \u201cscope\u201d clauses in United\u2019s current collective bargaining agreements with its pilots that restrict the number and size of regional aircraft that may be operated in its flight systems that are not flown by its pilots. Although United has significant room under its scope clauses with respect to 50-seat\naircraft, which comprise Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet, these clauses could limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to operate larger aircraft for United, which would limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s expansion opportunities. United is under no obligation to provide Air Wisconsin with an opportunity to fly additional aircraft within its system or to otherwise expand its relationship with Air Wisconsin.\nAir Wisconsin\u2019s ability to expand its operations in the future may be limited by a number of factors impacting the airline industry, including pilot and mechanic shortages, access to airport terminals and facilities, capital expenditures required to maintain or expand fleet operations, significant changes in fuel prices or other variable costs, regulatory changes, changes in the availability of necessary parts and equipment, and intense competition and pricing pressure. Given the competitive nature of the airline industry, we believe limited growth opportunities exist and as a result Air Wisconsin may be required to accept less favorable contract terms in order to secure new or additional flying opportunities. Due to United\u2019s stated intention in June 2021 to significantly reduce its use of single class 50-seat\naircraft by 2026, there may not be any new or additional flying opportunities available to Air Wisconsin with United. In addition, due to American Airlines\u2019 and Delta Airlines\u2019 stated intentions to significantly reduce or retire their use of single class 50-seat\naircraft, there may not be substitute flying opportunities with other major airlines. Further, even if Air Wisconsin is offered the ability to pursue growth opportunities in the future, they may involve economic terms or financing commitments that are unfavorable to Air Wisconsin or do not result in profitable operations.\nThe amounts Air Wisconsin receives under the United capacity purchase agreement may be less than the corresponding costs Air Wisconsin incurs.\nUnder the United capacity purchase agreement, a portion of the revenues Air Wisconsin receives is based upon predetermined rates calculated by reference to certain factors, such as the number of covered aircraft, the number of block hours flown and the number of departures. The primary operating costs intended to be compensated by the predetermined rates include salaries and benefits, training costs, crew room costs, maintenance expenses, simulator and spare parts costs, and overhead costs. If Air Wisconsin\u2019s costs for those items exceed the compensation paid under the agreement, our financial position and operating results will be negatively affected. For example, Air Wisconsin has experienced upward pressure on pilot and mechanic compensation as it seeks to attract and retain qualified staff, which increases are not adjusted for by the United capacity purchase agreement and, therefore, negatively impact our operating results.\nAir Wisconsin currently operates only one aircraft type, and relies on one aircraft manufacturer and one engine manufacturer, and any operating restrictions or safety concerns applicable to this aircraft or engine type, or any failure to receive sufficient maintenance and support services from these manufacturers, would negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nAir Wisconsin currently relies on a single aircraft type, the CRJ-200\nregional jet, and a single engine type, the General Electric (\u201cGE\u201d) CF34-3B1\nengine. The issuance of FAA or manufacturer directives restricting or prohibiting the use of this aircraft type or engine type, or Air Wisconsin\u2019s inability to obtain necessary parts and services related to this aircraft type or engine type, would negatively impact our business and financial results. In addition, any concerns raised regarding the safety or reliability of the CRJ-200\nregional jet or the GE CF34-3B1\nengine, whether or not directly associated with Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet, could result in concerns about Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet that could negatively impact our business.\nAir Wisconsin has been highly dependent upon Bombardier, Inc. (\u201cBombardier\u201d), as the sole manufacturer of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, and GE, as the sole manufacturer of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft engines, to provide sufficient parts and related maintenance and support services to it in a timely manner. In June 2020, Bombardier consummated an agreement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd (\u201cMitsubishi\u201d), pursuant to which Mitsubishi purchased Bombardier\u2019s regional jet program, including all aspects of the CRJ-200\nregional jet, such as type certificates, maintenance, support, refurbishment, marketing and sales activities. Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations could be materially and adversely affected by the failure or inability of Mitsubishi or GE to provide required maintenance or support services, or as a result of unscheduled or unanticipated maintenance requirements for Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft or engines.\nAir Wisconsin\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing may be limited, and, in the event Air Wisconsin is unable to repay its debt and other contractual obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nThe airline business is capital intensive. As of December 31, 2021, Air Wisconsin had approximately $67.6 million in total third-party debt, which was incurred in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and which is secured by substantially all of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, engines and parts. To the extent Air Wisconsin finances its activities with additional debt, it would become subject to additional debt service obligations, as well as additional covenants that may restrict its ability to pursue its business strategy or otherwise constrain its growth and operations. Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to pay the high level of fixed costs associated with operating a regional airline will therefore depend on its operating performance, cash flows and ability to secure adequate financing, which will in turn depend on, among other things, the success of its current business strategy, availability and cost of financing, as well as general economic and political conditions and other factors that may be beyond its control. We cannot be certain Air Wisconsin\u2019s working capital and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to make its required payments under its debt and other contractual arrangements.\nIf Air Wisconsin is unable to pay its debts as they come due or fails to comply with its obligations under the agreements governing its debt, and is unable to obtain waivers of such defaults, its secured lender could foreclose on any of Air Wisconsin\u2019s assets securing such debt. Additionally, a failure to pay Air Wisconsin\u2019s property leases, debt or other fixed cost obligations, or a breach of its other contractual obligations, could result in a variety of further adverse consequences, including the exercise of remedies by its creditors and lessors, such as acceleration. In such a situation, Air Wisconsin may not be able to cure its breach, fulfill its contractual obligations, make required lease payments or otherwise cover its fixed costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the agreements that Air Wisconsin has entered into with the Treasury for payroll support contain various covenants. If Air Wisconsin fails to comply with its obligations under those agreements, it may be required to repay the funds provided to it under those agreements. Any such default, acceleration, insolvency or failure to comply would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of Air Wisconsin\u2019s workforce is represented by labor unions, and the terms of Air Wisconsin\u2019s collective bargaining agreements may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our financial results.\nA significant majority of Air Wisconsin\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions, including the Air Line Pilots Association, International (\u201cALPA\u201d), the Association of Flight Attendants (\u201cAFA\u201d), the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers AFL-CIO\n(\u201cIAMAW\u201d), and the Transport Workers Union of America (\u201cTWU\u201d). The terms and conditions of future collective bargaining agreements may be affected by the results of collective bargaining negotiations at other airlines that may have a greater ability, due to larger scale, greater efficiency, or other factors, to bear higher costs than Air Wisconsin, which may result in higher industry wages and increased pressure on Air Wisconsin to increase the wages and benefits of its employees. Future agreements may be on terms that are less favorable to Air Wisconsin than its current agreements or not comparable to agreements entered into by its competitors. Moreover, we cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements. Any agreements reached in collective bargaining may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our financial results. If Air Wisconsin is unable to reach agreement with any of its unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, it may be subject to work interruptions, stoppages or shortages.\nMaintenance costs may increase further, and out-of-service\nperiods may result in aircraft being unavailable for flying.\nThe average age of Air Wisconsin\u2019s CRJ-200\nregional jets as of December 31, 2021 was approximately 19.3 years. As Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet continues to age, its maintenance costs may increase, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of its operating expenses, and may result in out-of-service\nperiods during which aircraft are dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable for flying under the United capacity purchase agreement. In addition, as noted above, there is an industry wide shortage of aircraft mechanics. Air Wisconsin has increased its labor costs to attract and retain qualified mechanics. However, as passenger demand for air travel has increased and additional aircraft are brought back into service to address the increased demand, the turnaround time for routine and heavy maintenance has lengthened. As a result, Air Wisconsin has experienced, and may continue to experience, delays and increased costs in obtaining both in-house\nand third party maintenance services. Any continued increase in Air Wisconsin\u2019s maintenance costs or decreased revenues resulting from out-of-service\nperiods could have a further adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe loss of key personnel upon whom Air Wisconsin depends to operate its business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Among other things, the agreements that Air Wisconsin has entered into with the Treasury for payroll support impose significant restrictions on Air Wisconsin\u2019s executive compensation. Such restrictions, over time, will likely result in lower executive compensation in the airline industry than is prevailing in other industries, which may present retention challenges in the case of executives presented with alternative opportunities. Any inability to attract or retain qualified management personnel and other employees would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInformation technology security breaches, hardware or software failures, or other information technology infrastructure disruptions may negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nThe performance and reliability of Air Wisconsin\u2019s technology, the technology of United, and the technology of our third-party service providers, are critical to Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to compete effectively. Any internal technological error or failure or large-scale external interruption in the technological infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt Air Wisconsin\u2019s internal network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of Air Wisconsin\u2019s technology, or that of United or our third-party service providers, could impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to conduct its business, lower the utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft and result in increased costs and penalties. Air Wisconsin\u2019s technological systems, software and related data, those of United, and those supplied by our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption or exploitation due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues.\nIn addition, as a part of Air Wisconsin\u2019s ordinary business operations, it collects and stores sensitive data, including personal information of its employees and information of United. Air Wisconsin\u2019s information systems are subject to an increasing threat of evolving cybersecurity attacks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to Air Wisconsin\u2019s systems or information through fraud or other means of deception. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. Air Wisconsin may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of Air Wisconsin\u2019s technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, employees\u2019, passengers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information and disruption to its operations, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe COVID-19\npandemic, and the outbreak of any other disease or similar public health threat that we may face in the future, could result in additional adverse effects on the business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity of Air Wisconsin and United.\nUnited, Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner, began experiencing a significant decline in domestic and international demand related to the COVID-19\npandemic during the first quarter of 2020. United has stated that it expects demand will remain below pre-pandemic\nlevels throughout 2022. As a result of lowered demand, United significantly reduced the number of Air Wisconsin\u2019s scheduled departures and block hours relative to 2019 levels. In the year ended December 31, 2021, Air Wisconsin\u2019s scheduled departures and block hours were approximately 81,755 and 121,409, respectively, as compared to scheduled departures and block hours of approximately 106,840 and 170,708, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Air Wisconsin\u2019s monthly departures and scheduled block hours generally increased from June 2020 until October 2021, but rarely reached pre-pandemic\nlevels and have declined slightly since October 2021, mostly as a result of pilot shortages. There can be no assurance as to whether departures and scheduled block hours will return to pre-pandemic\nlevels. United has stated publicly that it does not expect recovery from COVID-19\nto follow a linear path and, as such, the actual number of flights United schedules under the United capacity purchase agreement in any particular period may be significantly different from the number of flights we initially anticipated, or which United initially communicated for the period.\nThe magnitude and scope of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our business and future results of operations are highly uncertain and subject to change. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control, including the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies employed by United, the duration and spread of COVID-19,\nthe impact of COVID-19\non long-term demand for air travel, the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our financial health and operations and those of United, United\u2019s compliance with the United capacity purchase agreement, and future governmental actions, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, a further outbreak of COVID-19,\nincluding spread of new variants that may be more contagious or virulent than prior versions or that may be resistant to currently approved vaccines, an outbreak of another disease or similar public health threat, or any other event that would affect consumer demand for air travel or impose travel restrictions, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity, and those of United.\nSeveral regional and larger carriers have ceased operations as a direct or indirect result of the COVID-19\npandemic. ExpressJet Airlines, Inc., Miami Air International, Trans States Airlines and Compass Airlines, each of which are domestic regional or charter airlines, have either filed for Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy or ceased or severely limited operations due, at least in part, to the COVID-19\npandemic\u2019s impact on their business.\nThe airline industry is often negatively impacted by numerous factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe airline business is affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control, including air traffic congestion at airports, air traffic control inefficiencies, facility disruptions, acts of war or terrorism, cancellations, increased security measures, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and the outbreak of disease. Factors that cause flight delays frustrate passengers increase operating costs and decrease revenues, which in turn adversely affect profitability. Because Air Wisconsin\u2019s revenues (other than the portion of its revenues based on the number of aircraft covered under the United capacity purchase agreement) depend primarily on Air Wisconsin\u2019s completion of flights, and secondarily on service factors such as timeliness of departure and arrival, customer satisfaction, cancellations or delays, any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to the factors noted above, Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and our financial condition are currently affected, and may in the future be affected, by many other factors and conditions beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe on-going\nshortage of qualified pilots and mechanics;\n\u2022\nactual or potential changes in political conditions, including wars, outbreak of hostilities, terrorism, or government sanctions;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for airline travel or tourism, in consumer preferences, or demographic trends;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive environment due to pricing, industry consolidation, or other factors;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes, strikes, work stoppages, or similar matters impacting employees; and\n\u2022\nactual or potential changes in economic conditions, including rising fuel and other commodity prices, currency exchange rate fluctuations, increasing interest rates, and changes in discretionary spending and consumer confidence.\nThe effect of any of the foregoing factors or conditions on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations is difficult to forecast; however, the occurrence of any or all of such factors or conditions could materially and adversely affect its operations and our financial condition.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and has undergone a period of consolidation and transition leaving fewer potential major airline partners.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive. Air Wisconsin competes primarily with other regional airlines, some of which are owned or operated by major airlines. The airline industry has undergone substantial consolidation, including the mergers between Alaska Airlines and Virgin America, American Airlines and US Airways, Southwest and AirTran Airways, United and Continental Airlines and Delta and Northwest Airlines.\nAny additional consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry, such as the American Airlines and Jet Blue Airways alliance, could further limit the number of potential airline partners with whom Air Wisconsin could enter into commercial agreements. In addition, any further consolidation activity involving United, reduction in the size of its network or decision to accelerate the reduction of single class 50-seat\naircraft such as the CRJ-200\nregional jet could alter its business strategy or its perception of the value of its relationship with Air Wisconsin, which could limit opportunities for Air Wisconsin to provide additional service to United. Similarly, any further consolidation or restructuring of any major air carrier\u2019s regional jet programs, including as a result of long-term fleet strategy changes announced by several major carriers, could negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s future growth opportunities.\nTerrorist activities or warnings have dramatically impacted the airline industry and will likely continue to do so.\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath negatively impacted the airline industry in general. If additional terrorist attacks are launched, there may be lasting consequences, which may include loss of life, property damage, increased security measures, higher insurance costs, increased concerns about future terrorist attacks and additional government regulation, among other factors. Additional terrorist attacks, and warnings that such attacks may occur, could negatively impact the airline industry and result in decreased passenger traffic, increased flight delays or cancellations, as well as increased security, fuel and other costs and whether or not involving Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. Increased global political instability, including the outbreak of war and hostilities, could result in an increased risk of terrorist activities.\nHigh and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operating results and financial condition and liquidity.\nAlthough the United capacity purchase agreement provides that United sources, procures and directly pays third-party vendors for substantially all fuel used in the performance of the agreement, aircraft fuel is critical to Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations. The timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources as well as related service and delivery infrastructure. Air Wisconsin can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout Air Wisconsin\u2019s system. Supplies and prices of fuel are also impacted by factors, such as geopolitical events, economic growth indicators, fiscal/monetary policies, fuel tax policies, changes in regulations, environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets. Both actual changes in these factors, as well as changes in related market expectations, can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel prices in short periods of time. Rising fuel prices may lead to increases in airline fares or fees that may not be sustainable, may reduce the general demand for air travel and may eventually impact the amount of flying that United schedules Air Wisconsin to perform. Any such schedule reductions may impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s operating results. In addition, since single class 50 seat aircraft, such as those in Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet, are less fuel efficient than certain larger aircraft, increased fuel costs affects Air Wisconsin\u2019s competitiveness in the industry.\nThe occurrence of an aviation accident or incident involving Air Wisconsin or its aircraft type could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAn accident or incident involving Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft could result in significant potential claims of injured passengers and others, as well as negative impacts on its operations resulting from the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service. If substantial claims resulting from an accident are made in excess of our related liability insurance coverage, then our operational and financial results would be harmed. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured, could cause a public perception that Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations are less safe or reliable than other airlines, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nGiven that Air Wisconsin currently operates a single aircraft type, any accident or incident involving the CRJ-200\nregional jet aircraft type, whether or not operated by Air Wisconsin, may result in Air Wisconsin temporarily or permanently suspending service on all or a large portion of its fleet. Any grounding of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft could have an adverse impact on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations, its relationship with United, and our financial results. In addition, certain non-carrier-specific\ngroundings of at least a specified number of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft would provide United the right to terminate the United capacity purchase agreement.\nFurther, any accident or incident involving a CRJ-200\nregional jet, regardless of the operator or geographic location of the incident, could cause a public perception that the aircraft type is less safe and reliable than other aircraft types, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Any such accident or incident could result in an acceleration of the implementation of fleet strategy changes by major air carriers that would reduce or eliminate the use of 50-seat\naircraft, including the CRJ-200\nregional jet.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to significant governmental regulation and potential regulatory changes.\nAll air carriers, including Air Wisconsin, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d), the FAA and other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements. In addition, airports and municipalities enact rules and regulations that affect Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations. A decision by the FAA to ground, or require time consuming inspections of or maintenance on, all or any of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft for any reason may have a material adverse effect on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and our financial condition. Further, Air Wisconsin\u2019s business may be subject to additional costs as a result of potential regulatory changes, which additional costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to various environmental and noise laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and noise, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water and the use, management, disposal and release of, and exposure to, hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. Certain legislative bodies and regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on climate change and have taken actions to implement additional laws, regulations, and programs intended to protect the environment. For example, the federal government, as well as several state and local governments, have implemented legislative and regulatory proposals and voluntary measures intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with laws, regulations, and other programs intended to reduce emissions or otherwise protect the environment may require Air Wisconsin to reduce its emissions, secure carbon offset credits or otherwise pay for emissions, or make capital investments to modify certain aspects of its operations to reduce emissions. Future policy, legal, and regulatory developments relating to the protection of the environment could have a direct effect on its operations (or an indirect effect through its third-party providers of parts or services or airport facilities at which it operates) and increase its costs and have a material adverse effect on its operations. Any such developments could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAir Wisconsin is also subject to environmental laws and regulations that require it to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under certain laws, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict and joint and several, meaning that Air Wisconsin could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to it, which liability could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe requirement that Air Wisconsin remain a citizen of the United States limits the potential purchasers of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nUnder DOT regulations and federal law, Air Wisconsin must be owned and controlled by citizens of the United States as that term is defined in the Federal Aviation Act and interpreted by the DOT. The restrictions imposed by federal law and regulations limit who can purchase Air Wisconsin\u2019s equity securities in the following ways:\n\u2022\nat least 75% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s voting equity securities must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by persons or entities who are citizens of the United States;\n\u2022\nat least 51% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s total outstanding equity securities must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens and no more than 49% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s equity securities may be held, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have entered into \u201copen skies\u201d air transport agreements with the U.S. which allow unrestricted access on air service routes between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country; and\n\u2022\ncitizens of foreign countries that have not entered into \u201copen skies\u201d air transport agreements with the U.S. may hold no more than 25% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s total outstanding equity securities.\nThe restrictions on foreign ownership of Air Wisconsin\u2019s equity securities may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder of the Company and may adversely affect the trading price or trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nBecause the trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock is limited, the common stock may continue to be illiquid.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is traded under the symbol \u201cHRBR\u201d on the OTC Market, the trading volume for the common stock has been and continues to be limited. The Company has not listed, and does not currently intend to list, the Company\u2019s common stock for trading on any national securities exchange. Accordingly, we expect the common stock to continue to be illiquid for the foreseeable future. Investors should be aware that an active trading market for the common stock may never develop or be sustained.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been volatile. We believe the Company\u2019s stock price will be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that United will not agree to extend the United capacity purchase agreement or enter into a new agreement on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that United elects to terminate the United capacity purchase agreement prior to the expiration of the term as a result of the occurrence of a termination event specified in the agreement;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions and speculation as to the future terms of any capacity purchase agreement we may enter into with United or any other airline partner;\n\u2022\nfuture announcements regarding fleet strategy changes by major air carriers, including regarding any decision to reduce or eliminate single class 50-seat\naircraft;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the COVID-19\npandemic or other pandemics and widespread outbreaks of communicable diseases on passenger demand for air travel, consumer behavior and tourism;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results from period to period;\n\u2022\nthe repayment, restructuring or refinancing of Air Wisconsin\u2019s debt obligations and our actual or perceived need for additional capital;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions about our financial stability and the financial stability of Air Wisconsin\u2019s business partners;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions regarding Air Wisconsin\u2019s operating performance, reliability and customer service, and the operating performance, reliability and customer service of its business partners and competitors;\n\u2022\nfactors and perceptions impacting the airline industry generally, including future passenger demand for air travel;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant contracts, acquisitions or divestitures by us or Air Wisconsin\u2019s competitors, including any new or amended capacity purchase agreement with United or another airline partner;\n\u2022\nbankruptcies or other financial issues impacting Air Wisconsin\u2019s business partners or competitors;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment impacting Air Wisconsin\u2019s business and industry;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to the Company\u2019s publicly announced stock repurchase program or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe illiquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading practices of the Company\u2019s stockholders and other market participants;\n\u2022\nperceptions about securities that are traded on the OTC Market;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the application of accounting guidance;\n\u2022\nactual or potential changes in political conditions, including wars, outbreak of hostilities, terrorism, or government sanctions; and\n\u2022\nactual or potential changes in economic conditions, including rising fuel and other commodity prices, currency exchange rate fluctuations, increasing interest rates, and changes in discretionary spending and consumer confidence.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by companies across industries. These changes may occur without regard to the financial condition or operating performance of the affected companies. Accordingly, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with the Company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe concentration of ownership of the Company\u2019s capital stock among a small number of stockholders could allow such stockholders to exert significant influence over the Company\u2019s business plans and strategic objectives, control all matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval, or deter a change in control transaction, any of which could negatively affect the trading price or trading volume of its common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had 53,316,299 shares of common stock outstanding. As of the same date, Amun LLC (\u201cAmun\u201d) held 20,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, representing approximately 28.7% of the fully diluted shares of capital stock of the Company, and Southshore Aircraft Holdings, LLC, through its affiliates (together, \u201cSouthshore\u201d), held shares of the Company\u2019s Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries C Preferred\u201d), which are immediately convertible into 16,500,000 shares of common stock, representing approximately 23.6% of the fully diluted shares of capital stock of the Company (in each case assuming the full conversion of the Series C Preferred into common stock).\nThe shares of Series C Preferred are generally authorized to vote with the Company\u2019s common stock. As a result, Amun and Southshore collectively control a majority of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock and, therefore, are able to exercise significant influence over the establishment and implementation of the Company\u2019s business plans and strategic objectives, as well as to control all matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval. These stockholders may manage the Company\u2019s business in ways with which certain investors may disagree and may be adverse to their interests. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control transaction, depriving the Company\u2019s stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their investment, or otherwise negatively affecting the trading price or trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nMr. Bartlett, one of the Company\u2019s directors, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock held by Amun due to his status as a member of the board of managers of Amun and his ownership of equity interests in Amun. In addition, Mr. Bartlett may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares of the Series C Preferred held by Southshore due to his status as a member of the board of managers of Southshore and his ownership of equity interests in Southshore. Accordingly, Mr. Bartlett may be able to exercise influence over decisions involving the voting or disposition of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. However, Mr. Bartlett does not control voting or investment decisions made by either Amun or Southshore.\nThe Company may suspend its obligation to comply with SEC filing requirements in future periods, and thereby cease filing reports and other information with the SEC, which could have the effect of reducing the trading volume and trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn February 2012, the Company\u2019s predecessor, Harbor Biosciences, Inc., filed a Form 15 with the SEC to deregister its common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The filing of the Form 15 had the effect of suspending the Company\u2019s obligation, pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to file reports and other information with the SEC. As a result, prior to the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019, the last periodic report filed by the Company was the Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2011. As of January 1, 2020, the Company no longer met the eligibility criteria under Rule 12h-3\nof the Exchange Act to suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, requiring the Company to resume filing reports and other information with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.\nThe Company has incurred significant direct and indirect costs, and diversion of management time and resources, as a result of the requirement to comply with certain reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, including those incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of Annual Reports on Form 10-K,\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q\nand Current Reports on Form 8-K,\nthe audit of the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report in accordance with SEC rules and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) standards, and compliance with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company expects to incur significant additional costs relating to its public reporting obligations, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company would again become eligible to suspend its public reporting obligations if it (i) determines in accordance with applicable SEC rules it has fewer than 300 stockholders of record as of certain points in time, (ii) does not file registration statements pursuant to the Securities Act (which it does not currently intend to do), and (iii) meets certain other requirements under applicable SEC rules. If the Company becomes eligible to suspend its public reporting obligations in future periods, it may elect to take the actions necessary to suspend those obligations, which would result in the Company no longer being required to file SEC reports. If the Company ceases filing reports and other information with the SEC, it would significantly reduce the amount of publicly available information about the Company and its business and operations, which could have the effect of reducing the trading volume and price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nFurther, notwithstanding that the Company is currently required to file certain reports and information with the SEC pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company does not have a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company is not required to comply with, and does not intend to follow, certain disclosure requirements typically applicable to public reporting companies, including the requirement to file proxy statements, information statements, tender offer disclosures, and beneficial ownership filings. Accordingly, there may be significantly less information available about the Company, including its governance policies and ownership structure, than is available for other public reporting companies, which could have the effect of further reducing demand for the Company\u2019s common stock and the trading price.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s governing documents and the United capacity purchase agreement might deter acquisition bids, which could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, contain provisions that, among other things:\n\u2022\nprohibit the transfer of any shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock that would result in (i) any person or entity becoming a \u201cFive-Percent Stockholder\u201d (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-T(g))\nof the Company\u2019s then- outstanding capital stock, or (ii) an increase in the percentage ownership of any person or entity who is already a \u201cFive-Percent Stockholder\u201d of the Company\u2019s then-outstanding capital stock;\n\u2022\nauthorize the board of directors, without stockholder approval, to authorize and issue preferred stock with powers, preferences and rights that may be senior to the Company\u2019s common stock, that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock and could also have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the board of directors and propose matters to be brought before an annual or special meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company;\n\u2022\ngive the board of directors exclusive authority to set the number of directors and increase or decrease the number of directors by one or more resolutions, which may prevent stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the board of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize a majority of the board of directors to appoint a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which may prevent stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrestrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders.\nIn addition, the United capacity purchase agreement provides that a change of control of Air Wisconsin results in a termination event under the agreement, pursuant to which United may terminate its relationship with Air Wisconsin.\nThese provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur, or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial, any of which could also adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, limit certain transfers of the Company\u2019s stock in order to preserve the Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, which could adversely affect the trading price of its common stock.\nTo reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to use its current or future net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes, the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, prohibit certain transfers of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock that could result in adverse tax consequences by impairing the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards. These transfer restrictions are subject to a number of rules and exceptions, and generally may only be repealed or amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds\nof the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. These transfer restrictions apply to the beneficial owners of the shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. The transfer restrictions contained in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, may limit demand for the Company\u2019s common stock, which may adversely affect the trading price. In addition, this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur, or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nThe Company currently does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock and, consequently, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock may be the appreciation in value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company has not historically paid dividends on shares of its common stock and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. The United capacity purchase agreement, Air Wisconsin\u2019s credit agreements and the agreements that Air Wisconsin has entered into with the Treasury for payroll support contain restrictions that limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to pay, or prohibit it from paying, dividends to the Company. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions contained in current or future credit agreements or capacity purchase agreements, business prospects and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant. Consequently, investors should consider that their only opportunity to achieve a positive return on their investment in the Company\u2019s common stock may be the appreciation in value of the common stock. However, as a result of numerous risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, the trading price may not appreciate and may decline significantly.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company has availed itself of reduced disclosure requirements, which may make the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations, and it will continue to be a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as either (i) the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates\nas of the end of its most recently completed second quarter is less than $250 million or (ii) the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates\nis less than $700 million and the annual revenues of the Company are less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company has relied on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public reporting companies. These exemptions include reduced financial disclosure and disclosure regarding executive compensation. Investors may find the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive because it relies on these exemptions, which could lead to a less active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock and negatively impact the trading price.\nComplying with the requirements of public reporting companies under the Exchange Act, including the requirement for management to assess our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, could increase our operating costs and divert management\u2019s attention from executing our business strategy.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with the SEC with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these various reporting and compliance obligations has substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some of our business activities more difficult or costly, and increased demands on our management team. Significant additional resources and management oversight may be required to maintain and, as required, enhance our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, which could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results.\nFurther, the Company\u2019s status as a public reporting company has significantly increased the cost of its director and officer liability insurance, and the Company may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs in the future to obtain similar coverage. These factors, or other risks associated with being a public reporting company, could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of the board of directors and executive officers, and it may increase the cost of their services.\nWe could identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in future periods.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in preventing or remediating future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. We expect to continue to incur significant costs and diversion of management resources in an effort to enhance our controls and procedures. These efforts may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. Any newly identified material weaknesses could result in material misstatements of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Any such misstatements of our financial statements could lead to restatements of our financial statements, which could result in an adverse impact to our financial results and a decline in the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nShare repurchases could increase the volatility of the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nThe board of directors has adopted a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased an aggregate of 1,547,006 shares of its common stock pursuant to the repurchase program. Although the board of directors has authorized the repurchase program, and the Company has completed the purchase of shares of common stock, it does not obligate us to repurchase any additional dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time and for any reason. The additional number of shares to be repurchased, and the timing of any such repurchases, will depend on a number of factors, including the trading price of the common stock, the Company\u2019s financial performance and liquidity position, general market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. Our ability to repurchase shares may also be limited by restrictive covenants in future borrowing arrangements we may enter into from time to time. Repurchases of the Company\u2019s common stock could increase the volatility of the trading price and reduce the trading volume, either of which could have a negative impact on the trading price. Similarly, the future announcement of the termination or suspension of the repurchase program, or our decision not to utilize the full authorized repurchase amount under the repurchase program, could result in a decrease in the trading price. There can be no assurance that any repurchases we do elect to make will enhance stockholder value because the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares. Although the repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, we cannot guarantee that it will do so.\nThe Company may be at increased risk of securities class action and other litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the price of a company\u2019s securities. If the Company faces such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of our compliance with Exchange Act reporting obligations, a significant amount of information regarding our business and operations, including our financial condition and operating results, is publicly available, which may result in threatened or actual litigation or other disputes with our stockholders, our employees or other constituents. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could suffer and, even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish reports about our business, an active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock may not develop.\nThe extent of any trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will depend, in part, on any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We are not currently aware of any analysts who cover the Company nor do we expect any analysts to commence coverage in the foreseeable future. Investors should not purchase the Company\u2019s common stock with the expectation that we will have analyst coverage, or that an active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will be developed or sustained.", "PERMNO": 85376, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HRBR"}
