{"cik": "1357615", "company": "KBR, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Operations of our Business\nOur results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts.\nA portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly derived from new contract awards. Reductions in the number and amounts of new awards, delays in the timing of the awards or potential cancellations of such prospects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could adversely impact our long-term projected results. It is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale international and domestic projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions as well as governmental and environmental approvals. Since a portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. In addition, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and, as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project to proceed.\nThe uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. In some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of affordable trained engineers, craft labor, and other skilled workers, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected and our costs may increase.\nOur rate of growth and the success of our business depend upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of affordable trained engineers, craft labor and other skilled workers either through direct hire or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals. The market for these professionals is competitive. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected, the costs of executing our existing and future projects may increase and our financial performance may decline.\nDependence on craft labor, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could adversely affect our profits.\nWe rely on local craft labor, third-party subcontractors as well as third party equipment manufacturers to complete many of our projects. To the extent that we cannot engage qualified craft labor, subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials in the amounts and at the costs originally estimated, our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed-price contracts, we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts. In addition, if a subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services, equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason including, but not limited to, the deterioration of its financial condition, we may be required to purchase the services, equipment or materials from another source at a higher price. This may reduce the profit we expect to realize or result in a loss on a project for which the services, equipment or materials were needed.\nSome of our U.S. government work requires KBR and certain of its employees to qualify for and retain a government-issued security clearance.\nWe currently hold U.S. government-issued facility security clearances and certain of our employees have qualified for and hold U.S. government-issued personal security clearances which are necessary in order to qualify for and ultimately perform certain of our U.S. government contracts. Obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves lengthy processes, and it is difficult to identify, recruit and retain employees who already hold security clearances. If our employees are unable to obtain or retain security clearances or if our employees who hold security clearances terminate employment with us and we are unable to find replacements with equivalent security clearances, we may be unable to perform our obligations to customers whose work requires cleared employees, or such customers could terminate their contracts or decide not to renew them upon their expiration. Our facility security clearances could be marked as \"invalid\" for several reasons including unapproved foreign ownership, control or influence, mishandling of classified materials, or failure to properly report required activities. An inability to obtain or retain our facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract could disqualify us from bidding for and winning new contracts with security requirements as well as termination of any existing contracts requiring such clearances.\nOur use of the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues and profits.\nA significant portion of our revenues and profits are measured and recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition. Our use of this accounting method results in recognition of revenues and profits over the life of a contract, based generally on the proportion of costs incurred to date to total costs expected to be incurred for the entire project, the ratio of hours performed to date to our estimate of total expected hours at completion, or the physical progress on the project. The effects of revisions to estimated revenues and estimated costs are recorded when the amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any period and their effects could be material. The uncertainties inherent in estimating the progress towards completion or the recoverability of claims of long-term engineering, program management, construction management or construction contracts make it possible for actual revenues and costs to vary materially from our estimates, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits.\nWe conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and partnerships exposing us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.\nWe conduct a portion of our operations through large project-specific joint ventures where control may be shared with unaffiliated third parties. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. Also, we typically share liabilities on a joint and several basis with our joint venture partners under these arrangements. If our partners do not meet their contractual obligations, the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform and deliver its contracted services, requiring us to make additional investments or perform additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of services to the customer. We could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners, which may result in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses on the project. Additionally, these factors could have a material adverse effect on the business operations of the joint venture and, in turn, our business operations and reputation.\nOperating through joint ventures in which we have a minority interest could result in us having limited control over many decisions made with respect to projects and internal controls relating to projects. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls as we are. As a result, internal control issues may arise, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to establish or preserve relationships with our joint venture partners, we may agree to risks and contributions of resources that are proportionately greater than the returns we could receive, which could reduce our income and returns on these investments compared to what we may have received if the risks and contributed resources were proportionate to our returns.\nThe nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subjects us to risks associated with cost over-runs, operating cost inflation and potential claims for liquidated damages.\nWe conduct our business under various types of contracts where costs must be estimated in advance of our performance. Approximately 10% of the value of our backlog is attributable to fixed-price contracts where we bear a significant portion of the risk of cost over-runs. These types of contracts are priced, in part, on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on assumptions including prices and availability of experienced labor, equipment and materials as well as productivity, performance and future economic conditions. If these estimates prove inaccurate, if there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, poor project execution, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of equipment and materials or our suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred. Additionally, we may be required to pay liquidated damages upon our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts. Our failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for fixed-price contracts or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within a specified time frame or cost estimate could result in reduced profits or, in certain cases, a loss for that contract. If the contract is significant, or we encounter issues that impact multiple contracts, cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our engineering and construction business exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes which may exceed or be excluded from existing insurance coverage.\nWe engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or other third parties or delays in completion or commencement of commercial operations, exposing us to legal proceedings, investigations and disputes. The nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. When it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits. Our professional liability coverage is on a \u201cclaims-made\u201d basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposures, the policies have deductibles, which result in our assumption of exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible could result in a significant loss for us, which may reduce our profits and cash available for operations.\nWe occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope which may result in additional direct and indirect costs. Often these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results.\nFor example, we are working in a joint venture with JGC and Chiyoda, on a joint and several basis, for the design, procurement, fabrication, construction, commissioning and testing of the Ichthys Onshore LNG export facility in Darwin, Australia. As further discussed in Notes 7 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements, the project has experienced significant cost increases associated with a variety of issues related to changes to the scope of work, delays and lower than planned subcontractor productivity. These issues have resulted in unapproved change orders and claims with the client as well as estimated recoveries of claims against suppliers and subcontractors that have been included in the project estimated profit at completion. Additionally, we anticipate making working capital advances to the joint venture to fund our proportionate share of the ongoing project execution activities which we expect to be approximately $300 million to $400 million over the next 12 months. The joint ventures current estimates for the change orders, customer claims and estimated recoveries of claims against suppliers and subcontractors may prove inaccurate and potentially result in refunding the client for amounts previously paid to the joint venture by its client or the inability of the joint venture to recover additional costs from its suppliers and subcontractors. The joint venture may also incur higher costs to complete the project than currently anticipated. Any of these events could result in material changes to the estimated revenue, costs and profits at completion on the project and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur U.S. government contract work is regularly reviewed and audited by our customer, U.S. government auditors and others, and these reviews can lead to withholding or delay of payments to us, non-receipt of award fees, legal actions, fines, penalties and liabilities and other remedies against us.\nU.S. government contracts are subject to specific regulations such as the FAR, the Truth in Negotiations Act, CAS, the Service Contract Act and DoD security regulations. Failure to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes may result in contract price adjustments, financial penalties or contract termination. Our U.S. government contracts are subject to audits, cost reviews and investigations by U.S. government contracting oversight agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (the \"DCAA\"). The DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including our labor, billing, accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. The DCAA has the authority to conduct audits and reviews to determine if KBR is complying with the requirements under the FAR and CAS, pertaining to the allocation, period assignment and allowability of costs assigned to U.S. government contracts. The DCAA presents its report findings to the Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\"). Should the DCMA determine that we have not complied with the terms of our contract and applicable statutes and regulations, payments to us may be disallowed, which could result in adjustments to previously reported revenues and refunding of previously collected cash proceeds. Additionally, we may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the Federal False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages.\nGiven the demands of working for the U.S. government, we may have disagreements or experience performance issues. When performance issues arise under any of our U.S. government contracts, the U.S. government retains the right to pursue remedies, which could include termination under any affected contract. If any contract were so terminated, our ability to secure\nfuture contracts could be adversely affected. Other remedies that could be sought by our government customers for any improper activities or performance issues include sanctions such as forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. Further, the negative publicity that could arise from disagreements with our customers or sanctions as a result thereof could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry, reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInternational and political events may adversely affect our operations.\nA portion of our revenues is derived from foreign operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries where we transact business. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include, but not be limited to:\n\u2022\nexpropriation and nationalization of our assets in that country;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\ncivil unrest, acts of terrorism, war or other armed conflict;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions;\n\u2022\nconfiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; or\n\u2022\ngovernmental activities or judicial actions that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments, limit the movement of funds, result in the deprivation of contract rights or result in the inability for us to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.\nDue to the unsettled political conditions in many oil-producing countries and other countries where we provide governmental logistical support, our financial performance is subject to the adverse consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest, strikes, currency controls and governmental actions. Our operations are conducted in areas that have significant political risk. In addition, military action or unrest in such locations could restrict the supply of oil and gas, disrupt our operations in such locations and elsewhere and increase our costs related to security worldwide.\nThe Referendum of the United Kingdom's Membership of the European Union could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThe 2016 referendum by the British voters to exit the European Union (\"Brexit\") adversely impacted global markets, including currencies, and resulted in the weakening of the British pound against other currencies. A weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our U.K. operations and contracts, denominated in the British pound sterling, to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. This mainly impacts the U.K. portion of our GS business segment where both revenues and costs tend to be denominated in British pounds. Volatility in exchange rates may continue as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our international operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nChanges in our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, many of which are developing countries. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and a change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings, which could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are audited by various U.S. and foreign tax authorities in the ordinary course of business, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. A significant increase in our tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.\nWe work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees and contractors or substantial costs.\nSome of our services are performed in high-risk locations, including but not limited to, Iraq, Afghanistan, certain parts of Africa and the Middle East, where the country or surrounding area is suffering from political, social or economic issues, war or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we have and may continue to incur substantial costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. Despite these precautions, we have suffered the loss of employees and contractors in the past that resulted in claims and litigation. In the future, the safety of our personnel in these and other locations may continue to be at risk, exposing us to the potential loss of additional employees and contractors that could lead to future claims and litigation.\nWe ship a significant amount of cargo using seagoing vessels exposing us to certain maritime risks.\nWe execute different projects in remote locations around the world and procure equipment and materials on a global basis. Depending on the type of contract, location, nature of the work and the sourcing of equipment and materials, we may charter seagoing vessels under time and bareboat charter arrangements and assume certain risks typical of those agreements. Such risks may include damage to the ship, liability for cargo and liability which charterers and vessel operators have to third parties \u201cat law.\u201d In addition, we ship a significant amount of cargo and are subject to hazards of the shipping and transportation industry.\nDemand for our services provided under government contracts are directly affected by spending by our customers.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with agencies and departments of the U.S., U.K. and Australia governments, which is directly affected by changes in government spending and availability of adequate funding. Additionally, government regulations generally include the right for government agencies to modify, delay, curtail, renegotiate or terminate contracts at their convenience any time prior to their completion. As a significant government contractor, our financial performance is affected by the allocation and prioritization of government spending. Factors that could affect current and future government spending include:\n\u2022\npolicy or spending changes implemented by the current administration, defense department or other government agencies;\n\u2022\nchanges, delays or cancellations of government programs or requirements;\n\u2022\nadoption of new laws or regulations that affect companies providing services to the governments;\n\u2022\ncurtailment of the governments\u2019 outsourcing of services to private contractors; or\n\u2022\nlevel of political instability due to war, conflict or natural disasters.\nWe face uncertainty with respect to our government contracts due to the fiscal and economic and budgetary challenges facing our customers. Potential contract cancellations, modifications or terminations may arise from resolution of these issues and could cause our revenues, profits and cash flows to be lower than our current projections. The loss of work we perform for governments or decreases in governmental spending and outsourcing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nCrude oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile and a decline in the price of oil and natural gas could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCurrent global economic conditions, including oil and gas price volatility, have reduced and continue to negatively impact our customers' willingness and ability to fund their projects. These conditions reduce customers' revenues and earnings and make it difficult for our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business trends and activities, thereby causing our clients to slow or curtail spending on our services, or seek contract terms more favorable to them.\nOur revenues are dependent on capital expenditures for LNG, refining and distribution facilities and other investments by oil and gas companies. The demand for these facilities and the ability of our customers to obtain capital on attractive terms to finance these projects is also substantially dependent upon crude oil and natural gas prices. These commodities are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Demand for the services we provide could significantly decrease in the event of a sustained reduction in demand for crude oil or natural gas, or a decline in oil and gas prices. Oil and gas companies (our customers) have reduced or deferred their major expenditures due to declines in crude oil and natural gas prices and other market uncertainties.\nDemand for our hydrocarbon services and technologies depends on demand and capital spending by customers in their target markets, many of which are cyclical in nature.\nDemand for many of our services in our commodity-based markets depends on capital spending by oil and natural gas companies, including national and international oil companies, and by industrial companies, which is directly affected by trends in oil, natural gas and commodities prices. Market prices for oil, natural gas and commodities have significantly declined in recent years reducing the revenues and earnings of our customers. As a result, many leading international and national oil companies have reduced capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for refining and distribution facilities by large oil and gas companies have a significant impact on the activity levels of our businesses. Demand for LNG facilities for which we provide services could decrease in the event of a sustained reduction in the price and demand for crude oil or natural gas. Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies or longer-term higher material and contractor prices impacting facility costs can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale projects. Prices of oil, natural gas and commodities are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Factors affecting the prices of oil, natural gas and other commodities include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nworldwide or regional political, social or civil unrest, military action and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for oil, natural gas, and industrial services;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations or policies, including the policies of governments regarding the use of energy and the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\na reduction in energy demand as a result of energy taxation or a change in consumer spending patterns;\n\u2022\nglobal economic growth or decline;\n\u2022\nthe global level of oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\noil refining capacity;\n\u2022\nshifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u2022\npotential acceleration of the development and expanded use of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulation, including limitations on fossil fuel consumption based on concerns about its relationship to climate change; and\n\u2022\nreduction in demand for the commodity-based markets in which we operate.\nOur backlog of unfilled orders is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and, therefore, may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenues or earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our backlog was approximately $10.6 billion. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or that the projects will be profitable. Many of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination or suspension at the discretion of the customer. From time to time, changes in project scope may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the timing of the revenues and profits that we actually earn. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services or equipment required by the project. Delays, suspensions, cancellations, payment defaults, scope changes and poor project execution could materially reduce or eliminate profits that we actually realize from projects in backlog. We cannot predict the impact that future economic conditions may have on our backlog, which could include a diminished ability to replace backlog once projects are completed or could result in the termination, modification or suspension of projects currently in our backlog. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIntense competition could reduce our market share and profits.\nWe serve markets that are global and highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. These highly competitive markets require substantial resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel. Our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process, which is standard in the industries we compete in. We are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing, schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services. Any increase in competition or reduction in our competitive capabilities could have a material adverse effect on the margins we generate from our projects as well as our ability to maintain or increase market share.\nThe U.S. government awards its contracts through a rigorous competitive process and our efforts to obtain future contracts from the U.S. government may be unsuccessful.\nThe U.S. government conducts a rigorous competitive process for awarding most contracts. In the services arena, the U.S. government uses multiple contracting approaches. Historically, omnibus contract vehicles have been used for work that is done on a contingency or as-needed basis. In more predictable \u201csustainment\u201d environments, contracts may include both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable elements. The U.S. government has also favored multiple award task order contracts in which several contractors are selected as eligible bidders for future work. Such processes require successful contractors to continually anticipate customer requirements and develop rapid-response bid and proposal teams as well as have supplier relationships and delivery systems in place to react to emerging needs. We face rigorous competition and pricing pressures for any additional contract awards from the U.S. government, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under the various multiple award task order contract criteria. It may be more difficult for us to win future awards from the U.S. government and we may have other contractors sharing in any U.S. government awards that we win. In addition, negative publicity regarding findings stemming from audits by the DCAA, congressional investigations and litigation may adversely affect our ability to obtain future awards.\nA portion of our revenues is generated by large, recurring business from certain significant customers. A loss, cancellation or delay in projects by our significant customers in the future could negatively affect our revenues.\nWe provide services to a diverse customer base, including international and national oil and gas companies, independent refiners, petrochemical producers, fertilizer producers and domestic and foreign governments. We depend on a limited number of significant customers. A considerable percentage of our revenues, particularly in our GS business segment, is generated from transactions with certain significant customers. Revenues from the U.S. government represented 46% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss of our significant customers, or the cancellation or delay in their projects, could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our intellectual property rights become obsolete, our competitive position could be adversely impacted.\nWe utilize a variety of intellectual property rights in providing services to our customers. We view our portfolio of process and design technologies as one of our competitive strengths and we use it as part of our efforts to differentiate our service offerings. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or infringed upon. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Since we license technologies from third parties, there is a risk that our relationships with licensors may terminate, expire or be interrupted or harmed. In some, but not all cases, we may be able to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights from alternative sources. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could diminish. In addition, if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. As a result, our business and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur current business strategy includes the possibility of acquisitions, which may present certain risks and uncertainties.\nWe may seek business acquisitions as a means of broadening our offerings and capturing additional market opportunities by our business segments and we may be exposed to certain additional risks resulting from these activities. These risks include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nvaluation methodologies may not accurately capture the value proposition;\n\u2022\nfuture completed acquisitions may not be integrated within our operations with the efficiency and effectiveness initially expected, resulting in a potentially significant detriment to the associated product/service line financial results and posing additional risks to our operations as a whole;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty managing our growth from acquisition activities;\n\u2022\nkey personnel within an acquired organization may resign from their related positions resulting in a significant loss to our strategic and operational efficiency associated with the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our daily operations may be reduced by the redirection of employees and other resources to acquisition activities;\n\u2022\nwe may assume liabilities of an acquired business (e.g. litigation, tax liabilities, contingent liabilities, environmental issues), including liabilities that were unknown at the time of the acquisition, that pose future risks to our working capital needs, cash flows and the profitability of related operations;\n\u2022\nwe may assume unprofitable projects that pose future risks to our working capital needs, cash flows and the profitability of related operations;\n\u2022\nbusiness acquisitions may include substantial transactional costs to complete the acquisition that exceed the estimated financial and operational benefits; or\n\u2022\nfuture acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, if at all. Moreover, to the extent an acquisition results in additional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might have an adverse effect on our credit capacity.\nWe rely on information technology (\"IT\") systems to conduct our business, and disruption, failure or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on IT systems in order to achieve our business objectives. From time to time, including in connection with acquisitions, we design and implement new or enhance existing enterprise IT systems to execute various functions within our business. These activities may involve substantial risks to our ongoing business processes including, but not limited to, accurate and timely customer invoicing, employee payroll processing, vendor payment processing and financial reporting. If these implementation activities are not executed successfully or if we encounter significant delays in our implementation efforts, we could experience interruptions to our business processes. Under certain contracts with the U.S. government subject to the FAR and CAS, the adequacy of our business processes and related systems could be called into question. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to secure confidential and proprietary information maintained on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and information contained within our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, cyber-attacks, other malicious activities from unauthorized third parties, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, or computer viruses. The failure of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. We have experienced security threats in the past, none of which we considered to be significant to our business or results of operations, but future significant disruptions or failures could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.\nAn impairment of all or part of our goodwill or our intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our net earnings and net worth.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $968 million of goodwill and $239 million of intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheets, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. We perform an annual and an interim analysis of our goodwill, as appropriate, to determine if it has become impaired. The analysis requires us to make assumptions in estimates of fair value of our reporting units. If actual results are significantly different from the estimates, we may be required to write down the impaired portion of goodwill. An impairment of all or a part of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and net worth.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulations and Law\nWe could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with international export and domestic laws, which are the subject of rigorous enforcement by the U.S. government.\nTo the extent that we export products, technical data and services outside of the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations governing trade and exports, including, but not limited to, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control within the Department of the Treasury. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines upon us as well as the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. U.S. government contract violations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or sanctions, contract termination, forfeiture of profit or suspension of payment, any of which could make us lose our status as an eligible U.S. government contractor and cause us to suffer serious harm to our reputation. Any suspension or termination of our U.S. government contractor status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, violations of which could include suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with the U.S. state or local governments, U.S. government agencies or the U.K. MoD, third-party claims, loss of customers, adverse financial impact, damage to reputation and adverse consequences on financing for current or future projects.\nThe FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws (\"Anti-bribery Laws\") in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these Anti-bribery Laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with Anti-bribery Laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our staff concerning Anti-bribery Laws and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, agents and other third parties who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with the requirements of these Anti-bribery Laws. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance. We cannot provide complete assurance that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third parties working on our behalf. If we are found to be liable for violations of these laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur work sites are inherently dangerous and we are subject to various environmental, worker health and safety laws and regulations. If we fail to maintain safe work sites or to comply with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur work sites often expose our employees and others to chemical and manufacturing processes, large pieces of mechanized equipment, and moving vehicles. Failure to implement effective safety procedures may result in injury, disability or loss of life to these parties. In addition, the projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of environmental, worker health and safety laws and regulations governing the generation, management and use of regulated materials, the discharge of materials into the environment, the remediation of environmental contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances and human health and safety. Violations of these laws and regulations can cause significant delays and additional costs to a project. When we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. We may be subject to claims alleging personal injury, property damage or natural resource damages by employees, customers and third parties as a result of alleged exposure to or contamination by hazardous substances. In addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental and employee safety laws. A claim, if not covered by insurance at all or only partially, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, more stringent regulation of our customers operations with respect to the protection of the environment could also adversely affect their operations and reduce demand for our services.\nVarious U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. These laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge or causation of the presence of contaminants. The liability under these laws is joint and several. The ongoing costs of complying with existing environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate.\nWe may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nContinued attention to issues concerning climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations that seek to restrict, or otherwise impose limitations or costs upon, the emission of greenhouse gases. International agreements and national, regional and state legislation and regulatory measures or other restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases could affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels, or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on us and our customers.\nRisks Related to Financial Conditions and Markets\nCurrent or future economic conditions in the credit markets may negatively affect the ability to operate our or our customers\u2019 businesses, finance working capital, implement our acquisition strategy and access our cash and short-term investments.\nWe finance our business using cash provided by operations, but also depend on the availability of credit, including letters of credit and surety bonds. Our ability to obtain capital or financing on satisfactory terms will depend in part upon prevailing market conditions as well as our operating results. If adequate credit or funding is not available, or is not available on terms satisfactory to us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nDisruptions of the capital markets could also adversely affect our clients\u2019 ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. In addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects, may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. Our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice.\nFurthermore, any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules. These disruptions could materially impact our backlog and financial performance.\nIn addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our Credit Agreement (as defined below) may be unable to meet their contractual obligations to us if they suffer catastrophic demands on their liquidity. We also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties, including vendors, suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively affected by events in the capital markets. If those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of service to our clients. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held at major banks and financial institutions located primarily in North America, the U.K. and Australia. Deposits are in amounts that exceed available insurance. Although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy, been forced into receivership or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that this may occur in the future. If this were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash and investments which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations.\nWe may change our dividend policy in the future.\nWe have maintained a regular cash dividend program since 2007. We anticipate continuing to pay quarterly dividends during 2018. However, any future payment of dividends, including the timing and amount of any such dividends, is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and may depend upon our earnings, liquidity, financial condition, alternate capital deployment opportunities, or any other factors that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our regular cash dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to obtain new contract awards if we are unable to provide our customers with letters of credit, surety bonds or other credit enhancements.\nCustomers may require us to provide credit enhancements, including letters of credit, bank guarantees or surety bonds. We are often required to provide performance guarantees to customers to indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. Failure to provide the required credit enhancements on terms required by a customer may result in an inability to bid, win or comply with the contract. Historically, we have had adequate letters of credit capacity but such capacity beyond our Credit Agreement is generally at the provider\u2019s sole discretion. Due to events that affect the banking and insurance markets generally, letters of credit or surety bonds may be difficult to obtain or may only be available at significant cost. Moreover, many projects are often very large and complex, which often necessitates the use of a joint venture, often with a market competitor, to bid on and perform the contract. However, entering into joint ventures or partnerships exposes us to the credit and performance risk of third parties, many of whom may not be financially strong. If our joint ventures or partners fail to perform, we could suffer negative results. In addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our current Credit Agreement. Any inability to bid for or win new contracts due to the failure of obtaining adequate letters of credit, surety bonding or other customary credit enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and future revenues.\nOur Credit Agreement imposes restrictions that limit our operating flexibility and may result in additional expenses, and this credit agreement may not be available if financial covenants are violated or if an event of default occurs.\nOur Credit Agreement provides a credit line up to $1 billion and matures in September 2020 (our \"Credit Agreement\"). It contains a number of covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur liens and indebtedness, sell assets, repurchase our equity shares and make certain types of investments. We are also subject to certain financial covenants, including maintenance of a maximum ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA and a minimum consolidated net worth, all as defined in the Credit Agreement.\nA breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our Credit Agreement, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments from our lenders to remedy a default. In the event of any default not cured or waived, the lenders are not obligated to provide funding or issue letters of credit and could elect to require us to apply available cash to collateralize any outstanding letters of credit and declare any outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, thus requiring us to apply available cash to repay any borrowings then outstanding. If we are unable to cash collateralize our letters of credit or repay borrowings with respect to our Credit Agreement when due, our lenders could proceed against the guarantees of our major\ndomestic subsidiaries. If any future indebtedness under our Credit Agreement is accelerated, we can provide no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nOur debt levels have increased as a result of our 2016 acquisitions.\nOur increased debt levels and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate cash flow from operations to the repayment of debt, interest and other related amounts, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, payment of dividends and share repurchase programs;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nreducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\ncausing us to be more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nexposing us to increased interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations are at variable interest rates; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our risk of a covenant violation under our Credit Agreement.\nProvisions in our charter documents, Delaware law and our Credit Agreement may inhibit a takeover or impact operational control which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware corporate law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. These provisions include, among others, prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, advance notice for making nominations at meetings of stockholders, providing for the state of Delaware as the exclusive forum for lawsuits concerning certain corporate matters and the issuance of preferred stock with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock without stockholder approval. These provisions would apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, our Credit Agreement contains a default provision that is triggered upon a change in control of at least 25%, which would impede a takeover and/or make a takeover more costly.\nWe are subject to foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to reinvest earnings from operations. Our ability to mitigate our foreign exchange risk through hedging transactions may be limited.\nWe generally attempt to denominate our contracts in U.S. Dollars or in the currencies of our costs. However, we do enter into contracts that subject us to currency risk exposure, primarily when our contract revenues are denominated in a currency different from the contract costs. A portion of our consolidated revenues and consolidated operating expenses are in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risks, including risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries.\nThe governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations of a particular currency. We are often required to pay all or a portion of our costs associated with a project in the local currency. As a result, we generally attempt to negotiate contract terms with our customer, who is often affiliated with the local government, or has a significant local presence, to provide that we are only paid in the local currency for amounts that match our local expenses. If we are unable to match our local currency costs with revenues in the local currency, we would be exposed to the risk of adverse changes in currency exchange rates.\nIf we need to sell or issue additional common shares to refinance existing debt or to finance future acquisitions, our existing shareholder ownership could be diluted.\nPart of our business strategy is to expand into new markets and enhance our position in existing markets, both domestically and internationally, which may include the acquiring and merging of complementary businesses. To successfully fund and complete such potential acquisitions, we may issue additional equity securities that may result in dilution of our existing shareholder ownership's earnings per share.\nWe make equity investments in privately financed projects in which we could sustain significant losses.\nWe participate in privately financed projects that enable governments and other customers to finance large-scale projects, such as the acquisition and maintenance of major military equipment, capital projects and service purchases. These projects typically include the facilitation of nonrecourse financing, the design and construction of facilities and the provision of operation and maintenance services for an agreed-upon period after the facilities have been completed. We may incur contractually reimbursable costs and typically make investments prior to an entity achieving operational status or receiving project financing. If a project is unable to obtain financing, we could incur losses on our investments and any related contractual receivables. After completion of these projects, the return on our investments can be dependent on the operational success of the project and market factors which may not be under our control. As a result, we could sustain a loss on our equity investment in these projects.\nWe may be required to contribute additional cash to meet our significant underfunded benefit obligations associated with pension benefit plans we manage.\nWe have frozen defined benefit pension plans for employees primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. At December 31, 2017, our defined benefit pension plans had an aggregate funding deficit (the excess of projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets) of approximately $391 million, the majority of which is related to our defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. In the future, our pension deficits may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan performance and other factors that may require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost to satisfy our funding requirements. If we are required or elect to make up all or a portion of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our financial position could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur U.K. defined benefit pension plan has an aggregate funding deficit. Our U.K. pension plan has been frozen to new participants for a number of years, but can still have an aggregate funding deficit due to assumptions and factors noted below. For our frozen defined benefit pension plan in the U.K., the annual minimum funding requirements are based on a binding agreement with the plan trustees that is negotiated on a triennial basis. This agreement also includes other assurances and commitments regarding the business and assets that support the U.K. pension plan. Our next triennial valuation period begins in April 2018. It is possible that, following future valuations of our U.K. pension plan assets and liabilities or following future discussions with the trustees, the annual funding obligation will change. The future valuations under the U.K. pension plan can be affected by a number of assumptions and factors, including legislative changes, assumptions regarding interest rates, inflation, mortality, compensation increases and retirement rates, the investment strategy and performance of the plan assets, and (in certain circumstance) actions by the U.K. pensions regulator. Adverse changes in the equity markets, interest rates, changes in actuarial assumptions and legislative or other regulatory actions could increase the risk that the funding requirements increase following the next triennial negotiation. A significant increase in our funding requirements for the U.K. pension plan could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial position.", "PERMNO": 91579, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "KBR"}
