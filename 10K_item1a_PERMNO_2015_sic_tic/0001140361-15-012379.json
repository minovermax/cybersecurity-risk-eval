{"cik": "1171662", "company": "TRIPLE-S MANAGEMENT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe must deal with several risk factors during the normal course of business. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to our Capital Stock\nCertain of our current and former providers may bring materially dilutive claims against us.\nBeginning with our founding in 1959 and until 1994, we encouraged, and at times required, the doctors and dentists that comprised our provider network to acquire our shares. Between approximately 1985 and 1994, our predecessor managed care subsidiary, Seguros de Servicios de Salud de Puerto Rico, Inc. (\u201cSSS\u201d) generally entered into an agreement with each new physician or dentist who joined our provider network to sell the provider shares of SSS at a future date (each agreement, a \u201cshare acquisition agreement\u201d). These share acquisition agreements were necessary because there were not enough authorized shares of SSS available during this period and afterwards for issuance to all new providers. Each share acquisition agreement committed SSS to sell, and each new provider to purchase, five $40-par-value shares of SSS at $40 per share after SSS had increased its authorized share capital in compliance with the Puerto Rico Insurance Code and was in a position to issue new shares. Despite repeated efforts in the 1990s, SSS was not successful in obtaining shareholder approval to increase its share capital, other than in connection with the Corporation\u2019s reorganization in 1999, when SSS was merged into a newly-formed entity having authorized capital of 25,000 $40-par-value shares, or twice the number of authorized shares of SSS. SSS\u2019s shareholders did not, however, authorize the issuance of the newly formed entity\u2019s shares to providers or any other third party. In addition, subsequent to the reorganization, our shareholders did not approve attempts to increase our share capital in 2002 and 2003.\nNotwithstanding the fact that TSS and its predecessor, SSS, were never in a position to issue new shares to providers as contemplated by the share acquisition agreements because shareholder approval for such issuance was never obtained, and the fact that SSS on several occasions in the 1990s offered providers the opportunity to purchase shares of its treasury stock and such offers were accepted by very few providers, providers who entered into share acquisition agreements may claim that the share acquisition agreements entitled them to acquire our or TSS\u2019s shares at a subscription price equivalent to that provided for in the share acquisition agreements. SSS entered into share acquisition agreements with approximately 3,000 providers, the substantial majority of whom never came to own shares of SSS. Such share acquisition agreements provide for the purchase and sale of approximately 15,000 shares of SSS. If we or TSS were required to issue a significant number of shares in respect of these agreements, the interest of our existing shareholders would be substantially diluted. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, only one judicial claim to enforce any of these agreements has been brought against the Company. The case was settled by the parties and, on August 2013, dismissed by the court with prejudice. Additionally, we have received several inquiries with respect to share acquisition agreements. Those agreements do not include anti-dilution protections and we do not believe that the amounts of any claims under the agreements with SSS should be multiplied to reflect the 3,000-for-one stock split effected by us on May 1, 2007. We cannot provide assurances, however, that claimants will not successfully seek to increase the size of their claims by reference to the stock split.\nWe have been advised by our counsel that, on the basis of a reasoned analysis, while the matter is not free from doubt and there are no applicable controlling precedents, we should prevail in any litigation of these claims because, among other defenses, the condition precedent to SSS\u2019s obligations under the share acquisition agreements never occurred, and any obligation it may, or we may be deemed to, have had under the share acquisition agreements should be understood to have expired prior to our corporate reorganization, which took effect in 1999, although the share acquisition agreements do not expressly provide for any expiration.\nWe believe that we should prevail in any litigation with respect to these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation, including with respect to the magnitude of any claims that may be asserted by any plaintiff, and the interests of our shareholders could be materially diluted to the extent that claims under the share acquisition agreements are successful.\nHeirs of certain of our former shareholders may bring materially dilutive claims against us.\nFor much of our history, we and our predecessor entity have restricted the ownership or transferability of our shares, including by reserving to us or our predecessor a right of first refusal with respect to share transfers and by limiting ownership of such shares to physicians and dentists. In addition, we and our predecessor, consistent with the requirements of our and our predecessor\u2019s bylaws, have sought to repurchase shares of deceased shareholders at the amount originally paid for such shares by those shareholders. Nonetheless, former shareholders\u2019 heirs who were not eligible to own or be transferred shares because they were not physicians or dentists at the time of their purported inheritance (\u201cnon-medical heirs\u201d), may claim an entitlement to our shares or to damages with respect to the repurchased shares notwithstanding applicable transfer and ownership restrictions. Our records indicate that there may be as many as approximately 450 former shareholders whose non-medical heirs may claim to have inherited up to 10,500,000 shares after giving effect to the 3,000-for-one stock split. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are defending various judicial claims by non-medical heirs of former shareholders whose shares were repurchased upon their death seeking the return of or compensation. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings - Claims by Heirs of Former Shareholders\u201d. In addition, from time to time, we receive inquiries from non-medical heirs with respect to shares we had redeemed.\nWe believe that we should prevail in litigation with respect to these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation regarding these non-medical heirs. The interests of our existing shareholders could be materially diluted to the extent that any such claims are successful.\nThe dual class structure may not successfully protect against significant dilution of your shares of Class B common stock.\nWe designed our dual class structure of capital stock to offset the potential impact on the value of our Class B common stock attributable to any issuance of shares of common stock for less than market value in respect of a successful claim against us under any share acquisition agreement or by a non-medical heir. We believe that this mechanism will effectively protect investors in our shares of Class B common stock against any potential dilution attributable to the issuance of any shares in respect of such claims at below market prices. We cannot, however, provide any assurances that this mechanism will be effective under all circumstances.\nWhile we expect to prevail against any such claims brought against us and, to the extent that we do not prevail, would expect to issue Class A common stock in respect of any such claim, there can be no assurance that the claimants in any such lawsuit will not seek to acquire Class B common stock. The issuance of a significant number of shares of Class B common stock, if followed by a material further issuance of shares of common stock to separate claimants could impair the effectiveness of the anti-dilution protections of the Class B common stock. In addition, we cannot provide any assurances that the anti-dilution protections afforded our Class B common stock will not be challenged by share acquisition providers and/or non-medical heir claimants to the extent that these protections limit the percentage ownership of us that may be acquired by such claimants. We believe that such a challenge should not prevail, but cannot provide any assurances of the outcome.\nIn the event that claimants acquire shares of our managed care subsidiary, TSS, at less than fair value, we will not be able to prevent dilution of the value of the Class B shareholders\u2019 ownership interest in us to the extent that the net value received by such claimants exceeds the value of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Finally, the anti-dilution protection afforded by the dual class structure may cease to be of further effect at any time because all remaining shares of Class A common stock may, at the sole discretion of our board of directors and after considering relevant factors, including market conditions at the time, be converted into shares of Class B common stock. On May 17, 2013, the Company converted 6,660,423 shares of Class A common stock to Class B common stock. Concurrently with the conversion, 6,210,423 of such converted shares were sold in a registered secondary public offering.\nFuture sales of our Class B common stock, or the perception that such future sales may occur, may have an adverse impact on its market price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that large sales could occur, could cause the market price of our Class B common stock to decline. Either of these limits our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities. As of December 31, 2014 there were 24,654,497 shares of Class B common stock and 2,377,689 shares of Class A common stock. Our Class A common stock is no longer subject to contractual lockup; thus, such shares are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act by persons other than our \u2018\u2018affiliates\u2019\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, although such shares will continue not to be listed on the NYSE and will not be fungible with our listed shares of Class B common stock. All or any portion of our shares of Class A common stock may at the sole discretion of our board of directors and after considering relevant factors, including market conditions at the time, be converted to shares of Class B common stock.\nThe price of our Class B stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nOur share price is likely to fluctuate in the future because of the volatility of the stock market in general and a variety of factors, including those discussed under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d herein, many of which are beyond our control. Market fluctuations could result in volatility in the price of shares of our Class B common stock. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts or investors, or if we are perceived by the market to suffer material business or reputational damage, we may experience a significant decline in the trading price of our Class B common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur inability to contain managed care costs may adversely affect our business and profitability.\nA substantial portion of our managed care revenue is generated by premiums consisting of monthly payments per member that are established by contracts with our commercial customers or CMS (for our Medicare Advantage plans), all of which are typically renewable on an annual basis. If our medical expenses exceed our estimates, except in very limited circumstances or as a result of risk score adjustments for member acuity in the case of the Medicare Advantage products, we will be unable to increase the premiums we receive under these contracts during the then-current terms. As a result, our profitability in any year depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to adequately predict and effectively manage our medical expenses related to the provision of managed care services through underwriting criteria, medical management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Government-imposed limitations on Medicare reimbursement have also caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care costs. Also, we have in the past and may in the future enter into new lines of business in which it may be difficult to estimate anticipated costs. Numerous factors affecting the cost of managed care, including changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies such as genetic laboratory screening for diseases including breast cancer, electronic recordkeeping, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment including the implementation of ACA, may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage managed care costs, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to implement increases in premium rates on a timely basis may adversely affect our business and profitability.\nIn addition to the challenge of managing managed care costs, we face pressure to contain premium rates. Our customers may move to a competitor at policy renewal to obtain more favorable premiums. Also, the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance may disapprove proposed rate increases in the individual and small business markets. Future Medicare premium rate levels may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain medical expense or other budgetary constraints. CMS has recently announced projected Medicare Advantage plan rates for contract year 2016, which would, if implemented, functionally reduce the overall payments to our Medicare Advantage plans, largely due to the continued transitional phase-in required under the ACA to align Medicare Advantage benchmarks with the traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Continued changes in the Medicare Advantage program, including with respect to funding, which cuts are expected to continue to be phased in through 2017, may lead to continued reductions in the amount of reimbursement, elimination of coverage for certain benefits, or reductions in the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for Medicare. A limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is under soft market conditions for commercial lines and consequently is highly competitive, and we believe that it will remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Competitors may offer products at prices and on terms that are not consistent with economic standards in an effort to maintain or increase their business. The property and casualty insurance industry has historically been cyclical, with periods characterized by intense price competition and less restrictive underwriting standards followed by periods of higher premium rates and more selective underwriting standards. The competitive environment in which we operate is also impacted by current general economic conditions, which could reduce the volume of business available to us, as well as to our competitors.\nOur profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our current provider agreements and to enter into other appropriate agreements.\nOur profitability is dependent upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals, physicians and other managed care providers. We face heavy competition from other managed care plans to enter into contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers in our provider networks. Consolidation in our industry, both on the provider side and on the managed care side, only exacerbates this competition. In recent years some groups of providers have been pressing for legislation that would allow them to collectively negotiate certain contract terms through cooperatives. Although such legislation has not been passed, the Public Corporation for the Supervision and Insurance of Cooperatives in Puerto Rico has adopted rules that allow certain providers to negotiate collectively service fees through cooperatives, on a voluntary basis, with insurance companies and healthcare organizations. To the extent collective negotiations with providers become mandatory or we otherwise are required to enter into collective negotiations with providers, we expect that maintaining or securing new cost-effective managed care provider contracts would become more difficult, which could result in a loss in membership or higher medical costs and could adversely affect our business.\nA reduction in the enrollment in our managed care programs could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nA reduction in the number of enrollees in our managed care programs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could contribute to a reduction in enrollment include: failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers; suspension or loss of our ability to enroll new customers; premium increases and benefit changes; our exit from a specific market; reductions in workforce by existing customers; negative publicity and news coverage; failure to maintain the BCBS license; and any general economic downturn that results in business failures.\nWe are dependent on a small number of government contracts to generate a significant amount of the revenues of our managed care business.\nOur managed care business participates in government contracts that generate a significant amount of our consolidated operating revenues, including:\n\u2022 Medicare: We provide services through our Medicare Advantage products pursuant to a limited number of contracts with CMS. These contracts generally have terms of one year and must be renewed each year. Each of our contracts with CMS is cancellable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations. If we are unable to renew, or to successfully re-bid or compete for any of these contracts, or if the process for bidding materially changes or if any of these contracts are terminated, our business could be materially impaired. During each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, contracts with CMS represented 47.6%, 47.0% and 47.6% of our consolidated premiums earned, net, respectively, and -5.5%, 52.5% and 5.0% of our consolidated operating income, respectively.\n\u2022\nCommercial: One of our managed care subsidiaries is a qualified contractor to provide managed care coverage to federal government employees within Puerto Rico. Such coverage is provided pursuant to a contract with the OPM that is subject to termination in the event of noncompliance not corrected to the satisfaction of the OPM. During each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 premiums generated under this contract represented 7.2%, 7.0% and 6.4% of our consolidated premiums earned, net, respectively. The operating income generated under this contract represented 2.2%, 2.6% and 1.6% of our consolidated operating income during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Under the commercial business, we also provide health coverage to certain employees of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities. Earned premium revenue related to such health plans represented 5.8%, 6.4% and 7.5% of our consolidated premiums earned, net, respectively.\n\u2022 Medicaid: We participate in the government of Puerto Rico Health Reform Program (similar to Medicaid) to provide health coverage to medically indigent citizens in Puerto Rico. Under the current agreement, TSS is a third party administrator responsible for the provision of administrative services to subscribers in all service regions which currently services approximately 1,420,000 members. The administrative services we provide under the current agreement include case, disease and utilization management, network management and credentialing, enrollment and enrollee services and claims administration, among others. Our current contract for the Medicaid business is subject to termination in the event of any non-compliance by TSS that is not corrected or cured to the satisfaction of ASES, the government entity overseeing this program, or on 90 days\u2019 prior written notice in the event that ASES determines that there is an insufficiency of funds to finance the program.\nASES executed an agreement with TSS, dated January 21, 2015 (the \u201c2015 Contract\u201d), for the offering of health care services for the Medicaid subscribers in the Metro North and West regions of the government of Puerto Rico\u2019s health insurance program (the \u201cService Regions\u201d), which we believe includes approximately 430,000 subscribers. Under the terms of the 2015 Contract, TSS is responsible for providing of medical, mental, pharmacy and dental healthcare services to Medicaid subscribers in the Service Regions on an at-risk basis, commencing April 1, 2015 and continuing until June 30, 2017.\nUnder the 2015 Contract, and as a result of a separate letter agreement signed on January 14, 2015 to reflect an adjustment in co-payments (the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d), ASES will pay TSS a revised rate per member per month of $174.16 for the Metro North Region and $140.61 for the West Region. The 2015 Contract also provides for the payment of civil monetary penalties or liquidated damages by TSS to the extent it does not meet its obligations, which damages vary in amount depending on the nature of TSS\u2019s default. In lieu of imposing any liquidated damages, penalties or sanctions against TSS, ASES may withhold an amount not to exceed 10% of the per member per month payment for certain limited events of non-compliance, until such event is cured. Moreover, the 2015 Contract contains representations and warranties and indemnity, termination and default provisions customary for these types of transactions with the Government of Puerto Rico. Also, the 2015 Contract contains certain termination rights for both TSS and ASES, including ASES\u2019s right to terminate the 2015 Contract as a result of insufficient government funds to pay ASES\u2019s obligations under the 2015 Contract. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, operating income generated under our current agreement represented 37.1%, 32.5% and 45.8% of our consolidated operating income, respectively.\nIf any of these contracts is terminated for any reason, including by reason of any noncompliance by us, or not renewed or replaced by a comparable contract, our consolidated premiums and profitability earned could be materially adversely affected. See \u201c-Risks Relating to the Regulation of our Industry-As a Medicare Advantage program participant, we are subject to complex regulations. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be exposed to criminal sanctions and significant civil penalties, and our Medicare Advantage contracts may be terminated or our operations may be required to change in a manner that has a material impact on our business\u201d and \u201c-Risks Relating to the Regulation of our Industry- If we fail to comply with our corrective action plans with CMS and ASES regarding our provider credentialing and re-credentialing procedures, we may be subject to CMS compliance actions and ASES sanctions, ranging in each case from monetary penalties to contract termination\u201d for more information on the risk of termination of our contracts. In addition, if the liquidity of the Government of Puerto Rico, its agencies, municipalities and public corporations becomes significantly affected by the recent downgrades by the rating agencies or as a result of the inability to raise funding in the market or generate enough revenues, we may face credit losses in our premium and fees receivable from these and other government related entities, which could be significant.\nLocal government administration may implement a new regional pilot program in an effort to increase access to healthcare through the addition of new beneficiaries of the Health Reform Program, and the creation of a standard basic coverage aimed to promote the use of preventive health services and organ transplant benefits.\nThe Government of Puerto Rico has announced its intention to request CMS approval to begin a pilot program in an effort to bring universal healthcare coverage to Puerto Rico. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the details of this pilot program have not been detailed. However, the Department of Health of Puerto Rico has indicated its intention to implement this program during 2015. This new initiative may impact utilization of health care services and the medical loss ratio. As of the date of this Annual report on Form 10-K, there is uncertainty on how this initiative, if approved by CMS, will be implemented and its likelihood of success. Also, unfavorable changes in the number of beneficiaries under the program design of the standard basic coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA change in our managed care commercial product mix may impact our profitability.\nOur managed care products that involve greater potential risk, such as fully insured arrangements, generally tend to be more profitable than ASO products and those managed care products where employer groups retain the risk, such as self-funded financial arrangements. There has been a trend in recent years among our Commercial customers of moving from fully-insured plans to ASO, or self-funded arrangements. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, 68% of our managed care commercial customers had fully insured arrangements and 32% had ASO arrangements. Unfavorable changes in the relative profitability or customer participation among our various products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported claims would affect our reported financial results.\nA portion of the claim liabilities recorded by our insurance segments represents an estimate of amounts needed to pay and adjust anticipated claims with respect to insured events that have occurred, including events that have not yet been reported to us. These amounts are based on estimates of the ultimate expected cost of claims and on actuarial estimation techniques. Judgment is required in actuarial estimation to ascertain the relevance of historical payment and claim settlement patterns under each segment\u2019s current facts and circumstances. Accordingly, the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amount provided. We regularly compare prior period liabilities to re-estimate claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development; any difference between these amounts is adjusted in the operations of the period determined. Additional information on how each reportable segment determines its claim liabilities, and the variables considered in the development of this amount, is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d. Actual experience will likely differ from assumed experience, and to the extent the actual claims experience is less favorable than estimated based on our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase and future earnings could be adversely affected.\nThe termination or modification of our license agreements to use the BCBS name and mark could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive use of the BCBS name and mark in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla. We believe that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield name and mark are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. The termination of these license agreements or changes in their terms and conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS name and mark. Failure to comply with any of these requirements and restrictions could result in the termination of a license agreement. The standards under a license agreement may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. From time to time there have been proposals considered by the BCBSA to modify the terms of a license agreement to restrict various potential business activities of licensees. To the extent that such amendments to a license agreement are adopted in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our future expansion plans or results of operations.\nUpon any event causing termination of the license agreements, we would no longer have the right to use the BCBS name and mark in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla. Furthermore, the BCBSA would be free to issue a license to use the BCBS name and marks in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limitations on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency and the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. Accordingly, termination of a license agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the BCBSA requires us to comply with certain specified levels of risk based capital (\u201cRBC\u201d). RBC is designed to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparing each company\u2019s adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the \u201cRBC ratio\u201d). Although we are currently in compliance with these requirements, we may be unable to continue to comply in the future. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the revocation or loss of our BCBS licenses.\nUpon termination of a license agreement, the BCBSA would impose a \u201cRe-establishment Fee\u201d upon us, which would allow the BCBSA to \u201cre-establish\u201d a BCBSA presence in the vacated service area with another managed care company. The fee is currently $98.33 per licensed enrollee. If the re-establishment fee were applied to our total BCBS enrollees as of December 31, 2014, we would be assessed approximately $210.4 million by the BCBSA.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Blue Cross and Blue Shield License\u201d for more information.\nOur ability to manage our exposure to underwriting risks in our life insurance and property and casualty insurance businesses depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance coverage.\nReinsurance is the practice of transferring part of an insurance company\u2019s liability and premium under an insurance policy to another insurance company. We use reinsurance arrangements to limit and manage the amount of risk we retain, to stabilize our underwriting results and to increase our underwriting capacity. In the year ended December 31, 2014, 36.9%, or $52.1 million, of the premiums written in the property and casualty insurance segment and 5.8%, or $5.5 million, of the premiums written in the life insurance segment were ceded to reinsurers. In the year ended December 31, 2013, 37.9%, or $57.6 million, of the premiums written in the property and casualty insurance segment and 6.3%, or $8.7 million, of the premiums written in the life insurance segment were ceded to reinsurers. The premiums ceded and the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to changing market conditions and may vary significantly over time. Any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance coverage will increase our risk of loss. We may be unable to maintain our desired reinsurance coverage or obtain other reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or obtain new coverage, it will be difficult for us to manage our underwriting risks and operate our business profitably.\nIt is also possible that the losses we experience on insured risks for which we have obtained reinsurance will exceed the coverage limits of the reinsurance. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business\u00beLarge scale natural disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d If the amount of our reinsurance coverage is insufficient, our insurance losses could increase substantially.\nIf our reinsurers do not pay our claims or do not pay them in a timely manner, we may incur losses.\nWe are subject to loss and credit risk with respect to the reinsurers with whom we deal. In accordance with general industry practices, our property and casualty and life insurance subsidiaries annually purchase reinsurance to lessen the impact of large unforeseen losses and mitigate sudden and unpredictable changes in our net income and shareholders\u2019 equity. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to policyholders. In the event that all or any of the reinsurance companies are unable to meet their obligations under existing reinsurance agreements or pay on a timely basis, we will continue to be liable to our policyholders notwithstanding such defaults or delays. If our reinsurers are not capable of fulfilling their financial obligations to us, our insurance losses would increase, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade in our A.M. Best rating or our inability to increase our A.M. Best rating could affect our ability to write new business or renew our existing business in our property and casualty segment.\nRatings assigned by A.M. Best are an important factor influencing the competitive position of the property and casualty insurance companies in Puerto Rico. In 2014, A.M. Best maintained our property and casualty insurance subsidiary\u2019s rating of \u201cA-\u201d (the fourth highest of A.M. Best\u2019s 16 financial strength ratings) with a stable outlook. A.M. Best ratings represent independent opinions of financial strength and ability to meet obligations to policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Financial strength ratings are used by brokers and customers as a means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers. A.M. Best reviews its ratings periodically and we may not be able to maintain our current ratings in the future. A downgrade of our property and casualty subsidiary\u2019s rating could severely limit or prevent us from writing desirable property business or from renewing our existing business. The lines of business that property and casualty subsidiary writes and the market in which it operates are particularly sensitive to changes in A.M. Best financial strength ratings.\nSignificant competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\nManaged Care\nThe managed care industry in Puerto Rico is very competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively while appropriately pricing the business subscribed, our business and financial condition could be materially affected. Competition in the insurance industry is based on many factors, including premiums charged, services provided, speed of claim payments and reputation. This competitive environment has produced and will likely continue to produce significant pressures on the profitability of our managed care company. In addition, the managed care market in Puerto Rico is mature. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Puerto Rico\u2019s population decreased by 2.2% between 2000 and 2010, however the national population rate grew 9.7% during the same period. According to the US Census Bureau, the older population is an important and growing segment of the United States population. In fact, more people were 65 years and older in 2010 than in any previous census. Between 2000 and 2010, the population 65 years and older increased at a faster rate (15.1%) than the total U.S. population. In Puerto Rico, for the same period, the population 65 years and older increased by 27.5 %. As a result, in order to increase our profitability we must increase our membership in the Medicare Advantage program, increase market share in the commercial sector, improve our operating profit margins, make acquisitions or expand geographically. In Puerto Rico, several managed care plans and other entities were awarded contracts for Medicare Advantage or stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans. These other plans entered that market in 2006 and 2007. We anticipate that they can aggressively market their benefits to our current and our prospective members. Although we believe that we market an attractive offering, there are no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully with these other plans for new members, or that our current members will not choose to terminate their relationship with us and enroll in these other plans. Concentration in our industry also has created an increasingly competitive environment, both for customers and for potential acquisition targets, which may make it difficult for us to grow our business. The parent companies of some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. We may have difficulty competing with larger managed care companies, which can create downward price pressures on premium rates. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Competitive pressures faced by us may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture legislation at the federal and local levels also may result in increased competition in our market. While we do not anticipate that any of the current legislative proposals of which we are aware would increase the competition we face, future legislative proposals, if enacted, might do so.\nComplementary Products\nThe property and casualty insurance market in Puerto Rico is extremely competitive. Due to Puerto Rico\u2019s stagnant economy, there are few new sources of business in this segment. As a result, property and casualty insurance companies compete for the same accounts through pricing, policy terms and quality of services. We also face heavy competition in the life and disability insurance market.\nWe believe these trends will continue. There can be no assurance that these competitive pressures will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a holding company, we are largely dependent on rental payments, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries, although the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us is subject to the regulations of the Commissioner of Insurance, including maintenance of minimum levels of capital, as well as covenant restrictions in their indebtedness.\nWe are a holding company whose assets include, among other things, all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our subsidiaries, including our regulated insurance subsidiaries. We principally rely on rental income and dividends from our subsidiaries to fund our debt service, dividend payments and operating expenses, although our subsidiaries may not declare dividends every year. We also benefit to a lesser extent from income on our investment portfolio.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to the regulations of the Commissioner of Insurance. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital requirements. Our failure to meet these standards could subject us to regulatory actions.\u201d These regulations, among other things, require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital, thereby restricting the amount of earnings that can be distributed. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make any payments to us will also depend on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, if any, and other business and legal restrictions. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and creditors of our subsidiaries have a superior claim to such subsidiaries\u2019 assets. Our subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or otherwise contribute or distribute funds to us in an amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations. In addition, from time to time, we may find it necessary to provide financial assistance, either through subordinated loans or capital infusions to our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, we are subject to RBC requirements by the BCBSA. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-The termination or modification of our license agreements to use the BCBS name and mark could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\u201d\nOur results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry.\nResults of companies in the insurance industry, and particularly the property and casualty insurance industry, historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. The industry\u2019s profitability can be affected significantly by:\n\u2022 rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products;\n\u2022 volatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made and natural catastrophes;\n\u2022 changes in reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers\u2019 liability develop; and\n\u2022 fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment, which affect returns on invested capital.\nHistorically, the financial performance of the insurance industry has fluctuated in cyclical periods of low premium rates and excess underwriting capacity resulting from increased competition, followed by periods of high premium rates and a shortage of underwriting capacity resulting from decreased competition. Fluctuations in underwriting capacity, demand and competition, and the impact on us of the other factors identified above, could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe that underwriting capacity and price competition in the current market is increasing. This additional underwriting capacity may result in increased competition from other insurers seeking to expand the kinds or amounts of business they write or cause some insurers to seek to maintain market share at the expense of underwriting discipline. We may not be able to retain or attract customers in the future at prices we consider adequate.\nIf we do not effectively manage the growth of our operations, we may not be able to achieve our profitability targets.\nOur growth strategy includes enhancing our market share in Puerto Rico, entering new geographic markets, introducing new insurance products and programs, further developing our relationships with independent agencies or brokers and pursuing acquisition opportunities. Our strategy is subject to various risks, including risks associated with our ability to:\n\u2022 successfully implement our underwriting, pricing, claims management and product strategies over a larger operating region;\n\u2022 properly design and price new and existing products and programs and reinsurance facilities for markets in which we have no direct experience;\n\u2022 identify, train and retain qualified employees;\n\u2022 identify, recruit and integrate new independent agencies and brokers and expand the range of Triple-S products carried by our existing agents and brokers;\n\u2022 develop a network of physicians, hospitals and other managed care providers that meets our requirements and those of applicable regulators; and\n\u2022 augment our internal monitoring and control systems as we expand our business.\nAny such risks or difficulties could limit our ability to implement our growth strategies or result in diversion of senior management time and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are expanding our business operations outside of Puerto Rico and the United States.\nCurrent and potential business operations outside Puerto Rico and the United States may be affected by our ability to identify profitable new geographic markets to enter and our ability to operate in any such new geographic markets. We may also be subject to changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting our business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments. We may be also affected by our ability to obtain licenses in new areas where we wish to market our products. Deterioration of social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency rates could affect our financial results.\nWe face intense competition to attract and retain employees and independent agents and brokers.\nWe are dependent on retaining existing employees, attracting and retaining additional qualified employees to meet current and future needs and achieving productivity gains. Our life insurance subsidiary, TSV, has historically experienced a very high level of turnover in its home service agents, through which it places a majority of its premiums, and we expect this trend to continue. Our inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in order to market our products effectively, we must continue to recruit, retain and establish relationships with qualified independent agents and brokers. We may not be able to recruit, retain and establish relationships with agents and brokers. Independent agents and brokers are typically not exclusively dedicated to us and may frequently also market our competitors\u2019 managed care products. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers. If such agents and brokers do not help us to maintain our current customer accounts or establish new accounts, our business and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur investment portfolios are subject to varying economic and market conditions.\nWe have exposure to market risk and credit risk in our investment activities. The fair values of our investments vary from time to time depending on economic and market conditions. Fixed maturity securities expose us to interest rate risk as well as credit risk. Equity securities expose us to equity price risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. These and other factors also affect the equity securities owned by us. The outlook of our investment portfolio depends on the future direction of interest rates, fluctuations in the equity markets and the amount of cash flows available for investment. For additional information, see \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for an analysis of our exposure to interest and equity price risks and the procedures in place to manage these risks. Our investment portfolios may lose money in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to local laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain riskier investment categories, such as below-investment-grade fixed income securities, mortgage loans, and real estate and equity investments, among others, which could generate higher returns on our investments. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, any investments exceeding regulatory limitations would be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital.\nThe securities and credit markets could experience extreme volatility and disruption.\nAdverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets could significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities, other investments, our profitability and our financial position.\nAs an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfolio that is comprised particularly of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S. financial markets, volatility, uncertainty and/or disruptions in the global capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments\u2019 monetary policy. Theses factors can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our profitability and/or our financial position by:\n\u2022 Significantly reducing the value of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio, and creating net realized capital losses that reduce our operating results and/or net unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\u2022 Lowering interest rates on high quality short-term debt securities and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results.\n\u2022 Making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for example if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-to-period volatility in our operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\u2022 Reducing our ability to issue other securities.\nWe evaluate our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. It also requires us to make certain assessments about the potential recovery of the assets we hold. For the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of investment securities is based upon specific identification.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of realized losses associated with other-than-temporary impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2012, there were no realized losses associated with other-than-temporary impairments.\nThe gross unrealized losses of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities were $0.3 million and $11.8 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The gross unrealized gains of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities were $117.9 million and $88.8 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Given current market conditions, there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.\nWe believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under credit agreement, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements. However, continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions could significantly affect the availability of credit.\nOur business is geographically concentrated in Puerto Rico and weakness in the economy and the the fiscal health of the government has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us.\nWe are exposed to geographical risk because our principal lines of business are concentrated in Puerto Rico. We are also exposed to government risk due to our contract with ASES in connection with the government health plan.\nPuerto Rico\u2019s gross national product contracted in real terms in every year between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2011 (inclusive), and grew by 0.9% (revised figures) and 0.3% (preliminary) in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. According to the Planning Board, for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, gross national product is projected to increase by only 0.1% and 0.2%. However, the monthly economic indicators for fiscal year 2014 indicate that the final gross national product figures for fiscal year 2014 may be lower than the last projection presented by the Planning Board. This persistent contraction or minimal growth has had an adverse effect on employment and tax revenues, and has significantly contributed to central government budget deficits. Factors that can adversely affect Puerto Rico\u2019s ability to increase the level of economic activity include the high cost of energy, the loss of patent protection of several products manufactured in Puerto Rico and global economic and trade conditions.\nThe weakness of Puerto Rico\u2019s economy has adversely affected employment. Total employment in Puerto Rico decreased at an average annual rate of 0.9% from 1,150,291 to 1,006,646 from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2014. A reduction in total employment began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and has continued consistently through fiscal year 2014 due to the current recession and the fiscal adjustment measures implemented by the government. According to the Household Survey, during fiscal year 2014, total employment fell by 2.2% when compared to the prior fiscal year, and the unemployment rate averaged 14.3% compared to 14.0% for the prior fiscal year. Furthermore, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, total employment decreased by 3.3% with respect the first quarter of fiscal year 2014.\nIn February 2014, the credit ratings of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s general obligation bonds and guaranteed bonds, as well as the ratings of most of the Puerto Rico public corporations, were lowered (more than once in most cases) to non-investment grade by Moody\u2019s, S&P, and Fitch Ratings (\u201cFitch\u201d). The continued weakness of the Puerto Rico economy, liquidity constraints and market access were generally cited as the reasons for the downgrades.\nOn June 28, 2014, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act 71-2014, known as the Recovery Act. In light of the general inapplicability of Chapters 9 and 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code to Puerto Rico public corporations, the Recovery Act is intended to provide a legal process governing the enforcement and restructuring of the debts and other obligations of these types of government entities. The Recovery Act specifically excludes the government of Puerto Rico and COFINA (which senior lien bonds comprise the majority of the Company\u2019s Puerto Rico exposure) from its application. However, the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, our counterparty in connection with the services provided under the Government Health Plan, may seek relief under the Recovery Act. As a result of the enactment of the Recovery Act, the rating agencies further downgraded Puerto Rico\u2019s credit rating and that of the majority of its public corporations.\nDuring June and July 2014, certain holders of bonds issued by Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\u201cPREPA\u201d) and an investment manager, on behalf of funds that own PREPA bonds, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking a declaratory judgment that the Recovery Act violates multiple provisions of the United States Constitution. On February 10, 2015, the District Court entered judgment that the Recovery Act is preempted by the federal Bankruptcy Code and is therefore void pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitutions. The District Court also permanently enjoined Puerto Rico officers from enforcing the Recovery Act. Puerto Rico has filed a notice of appeal and has indicated its intent to vigorously defend the constitutionality of the Recovery Act.\nOn February 11, 2015, the Governor filed with the Legislative Assembly a comprehensive tax reform bill. As currently presented, the bill would significantly lower income tax rates and replace the 7% sales and use tax with a 16% value added tax. As proposed, the new tax would apply to services such as medical services paid by commercial health plans and business to business transactions not included in the current sales and use tax. The Governor\u2019s proposal seeks to shift the emphasis from taxing productivity to taxing consumption, while increasing revenues to the government by reducing tax evasion through a broadening of the tax base and simplifying the code. The bill is currently being evaluated by the Legislative Assembly and it too early to determine what changes, if any, will be incorporated and effect the bill, if enacted, will have on the economy and our business.\nAfter the Governor presented his tax reform proposal, both S&P and Moody\u2019s downgraded the credit rating of Puerto Rico and its public corporations. Both rating agencies cited concerns with the weakness in the Puerto Rico economy and current market conditions. They also cited the implementation risk surrounding a comprehensive tax reform of this nature.\nContinued weakness in the Puerto Rico economy or the failure of the Puerto Rico government to manage its fiscal problems in an orderly manner could have an adverse effect on our insured customers, which may be required to forego insurance coverage or scale back on the amount of insurance coverage purchased. In turn, if this trend continues or worsens, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to retain our executive officers and significant employees, and the loss of any one or more of these officers and their expertise could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are highly dependent on the efforts of our senior executives, each of whom has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships. While we believe that we could find replacements, the loss of the leadership, knowledge and experience of our executive officers could adversely affect our business. Replacing many of our executive officers might be difficult or take an extended period of time because a limited number of individuals in the industries in which we operate have the breadth and depth of skills and experience necessary to successfully operate and expand a business such as ours. We do not currently maintain key-man life insurance on any of our executive officers. We only have non-competition agreements in place with three executive officers, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.\nThe success of our business depends on developing and maintaining effective information systems.\nOur business and operations may be affected if we do not maintain and upgrade our information systems and the integrity of our proprietary information. We are materially dependent on our information systems, including Internet-enabled products and information, for all aspects of our business operations. Monitoring utilization and other factors, supporting our managed care management techniques, processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators, and our ability to compete depends on adopting technology on a timely and cost-effective basis. Malfunctions in our information systems, fraud, error, communication and energy disruptions, security breaches or the failure to maintain effective and up-to-date information systems could disrupt our business operations, alienate customers, contribute to customer and provider disputes, result in regulatory violations and possible liability, increase administrative expenses or lead to other adverse consequences. The use of member data by all of our businesses is regulated at federal and local levels. These laws and rules change frequently and developments require adjustments or modifications to our technology infrastructure.\nOur information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, upgrade and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, compliance with legal requirements (such as a new set of standardized diagnostic codes, known as ICD-10), and changing operational needs. In addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties' failure to perform adequately. If we are unable to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the information we rely upon to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, such as the inability to pay claims or to make claims payments on a timely basis, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing and reserves, loss of members, and difficulty in attracting new members, regulatory problems, increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences.\nIn addition, federal regulations, as amended by the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, require that we begin using ICD-10 by October 1, 2015, which will require significant information technology investment. In order to become ICD-10 compliant, we changed TSS\u2019s core business application, which we implemented in the third quarter of 2012. In addition, we completed the version upgrade process of such business application in the third quarter of 2013. If we fail to adequately implement ICD-10, we may incur losses with respect to the resources invested and have other material adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nOur business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security system and patient data stored in our information systems. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations. The internet is a public network and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems, or those of our providers or regulators, which could disrupt our operations, or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, possible liability and loss. We are taking all needed security measures to prevent security breaches, and ensure our business operations won\u2019t be adversely affected by potential security breaches.\nWe face risks related to litigation.\nIn addition to the litigation risks discussed above in \u2018\u2018Risks Relating to Our Capital Stock\u2019\u2019, we are, or may be in the future, a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we may be subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of our products and services. These could include:\n\u2022 claims relating to the denial of managed care benefits or insurance coverage;\n\u2022 medical malpractice actions;\n\u2022 allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities;\n\u2022 provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts;\n\u2022 broker and agents dispute over fees and term of their respective agreements;\n\u2022 disputes related to self-funded business;\n\u2022 disputes over co-payment calculations;\n\u2022 claims related to the failure to disclose certain business practices;\n\u2022 claims relating to customer audits and contract performance; and\n\u2022 claims by regulatory agencies or whistleblowers for regulatory non-compliance, including but not limited to fraud and health information privacy (including HIPAA).\nWe are a defendant in various lawsuits, some of which involve claims for substantial and/or indeterminate amounts and the outcome of which is unpredictable. While we are defending these suits vigorously, we will incur expenses in the defense of these suits. Any adverse judgment against us resulting in damage awards could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nLarge-scale natural disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPuerto Rico has historically been at a relatively high risk of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. If Puerto Rico were to experience a large-scale natural disaster, claims incurred by our managed care, property and casualty and life insurance segments would likely increase and our properties may incur substantial damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-financial covenants in our secured term loans and note purchase agreements may restrict our operations.\nWe are a party to a secured loan with a commercial bank of $41.0 million, for which we have an outstanding balance of $14.5 million as of December 31, 2014. Also, we have outstanding a senior unsecured note with an aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million, this note bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.60% and is due in 2020. The secured term loan and the note purchase agreements governing the notes contain financial and non-financial covenants that restrict, among other things, the granting of certain liens, limitations on acquisitions and limitations on changes in control. These non-financial covenants could restrict our operations. In addition, if we fail to make any required payment under our secured term loans or note purchase agreements governing the notes or to comply with any of the non-financial covenants included therein, we would be in default and the lenders or holders of our debt, as the case may be, could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our secured term loans or note purchase agreements to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest and, in the case of the secured term loans, cease to make further extensions of credit. If the indebtedness under our secured term loans or note purchase agreements is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or re-finance the amounts due and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Covenants related to such indebtedness could also adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our debt service obligations may require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek extraordinary dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. However, these measures might be prohibited by applicable regulatory requirements or unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nWe may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our secured term loan and note purchase agreements and the acceleration of amounts due thereunder. Indebtedness could also limit our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities, and may affect our ability to maintain an investment grade rating for our indebtedness.\nWe may pursue acquisitions in the future.\nWe may acquire additional companies or assets if consistent with our strategic plan for growth. The following are some of the potential risks associated with acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022 disruption of on-going business operations, distraction of management, diversion of resources and difficulty in maintaining current business standards, controls and procedures;\n\u2022 difficulty in integrating information technology of an acquired entity and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022 difficulty in the integration of an acquired entity\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, management, information, human resources and other administrative systems and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;\n\u2022 difficulty in the implementation of controls, procedures and policies appropriate for filers with the SEC at companies that prior to acquisition lacked such controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022 potential unknown or under-estimated liabilities associated with the acquired company;\n\u2022 failure of acquired businesses to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow;\n\u2022 dilutive issuances of equity securities and incurrence of additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022 establish goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of a future business combination, which may be incorrectly valued or become non-recoverable;\n\u2022 other acquisition-related expenses, including amortization of intangible assets and write-offs; and\n\u2022 competition with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies.\nIn addition, we may not successfully realize the intended benefits of any acquisition or investment.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014 we had approximately $25.4 million and $9.2 million of goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet, primarily related to the TSA acquisition, that represent 1.6% of our total consolidated assets and 4.0% of our consolidated stockholders\u2019 equity. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine the recoverability of their carrying values. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, including goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives). Estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of the equity and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record significant impairment losses against future income. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.\nAny future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations and stockholders' equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in stockholders' equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants.\nIn addition, the estimated value of our reporting units may be impacted as a result of the implementation of various Health Care Reform regulations. Such regulations could have significant effects on our future operations, which in turn could unfavorably affect our ability to support the carrying value of certain goodwill and other intangible assets and result in significant impairment charges in future periods. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d.\nRisks Relating to Taxation\nIf we are considered to be a controlled foreign corporation under the related person insurance income rules for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. persons that own our shares of Class B common stock could be subject to adverse tax consequences.\nWe do not expect that we will be considered a controlled foreign corporation under the related person insurance income rules (a \u201cRPII CFC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because RPII CFC status depends in part upon the correlation between an insurance company\u2019s shareholders and such company\u2019s insurance customers and the extent of such company\u2019s insurance business outside its country of incorporation, there can be no assurance that we will not be a RPII CFC in any taxable year. We do not intend to monitor whether we generate RPII or becomes a RPII CFC. If we were a RPII CFC in any taxable year, certain adverse tax consequences could apply to U.S. persons that own the Company\u2019s shares of Class B common stock.\nIf we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. persons that own the Company\u2019s shares of Class B common stock could be subject to adverse tax consequences.\nBased on our current business assets and operations, we do not expect that we will be considered a \u2018\u2018passive foreign investment company\u2019\u2019 (a \u201cPFIC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because PFIC status depends upon the composition of our income and assets and the market value of our assets (including, among others, less than 25 percent owned equity investments) in each year, which may be uncertain and may vary substantially over time, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any taxable year. Our belief that it is not a PFIC is based, in part, on the fact that the PFIC rules include provisions intended to provide an exception for bona fide insurance companies predominately engaged in an insurance business. However, the scope of this exception is not entirely clear and there are no administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions or Treasury regulations that provide guidance as to the application of the PFIC rules to insurance companies. If the Company were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, certain adverse consequences could apply to certain U.S. persons that own our shares of Class B common stock.\nLegislative and other measures that may be taken by Puerto Rico governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIt is expected that during the second quarter of 2015, a new comprehensive tax reform is implemented in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Among others, it is expected that the additional tax on gross income is repealed and the maximum corporate income tax rate is reduced. In addition, it is expected that a broad based value added tax of 16% is implemented replacing the current sales and use tax of 7%. As proposed, the new value added tax would apply to services such as medical services paid by commercial health plans and business to business transactions not included in the current sales and use tax.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry\nChanges in governmental regulations, or the application thereof, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to substantial federal and local regulation and frequent changes to the applicable legislative and regulatory schemes, including general business regulations and laws relating to taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, insurance, Medicare and health care fraud and abuse laws. Please refer to \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation\u201d. Changes in these laws, enactment of new laws or regulations, changes in interpretation of these laws or changes in enforcement of these laws and regulations may materially impact our business. Such changes include without limitation:\n\u2022 initiatives to provide greater access to coverage for uninsured and under-insured populations without adequate funding to health plan or to be funded through taxes or other negative financial levy on health plans;\n\u2022 payments to health plans that are tied to achievement of certain quality performance measures and by health plans that do not satisfy applicable medical loss ratio requirements;\n\u2022 other efforts or specific legislative changes to the Medicare or Medicaid programs, including changes in the bidding process or other means of materially reducing premiums;\n\u2022 local government regulatory changes;\n\u2022 increased government enforcement, or changes in interpretation or application, of fraud and abuse and health information privacy laws; and\n\u2022 regulations that increase the operational burden on health plans that increase a health plan\u2019s exposure to liabilities, including efforts to expand the tort liability of health plans.\nRegulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance, among other things, influence how our insurance subsidiaries conduct business and solicit subscriptions for shares of capital stock, and place limitations on investments and dividends. Possible penalties for violations of such regulations include fines, orders to cease or change practices or behavior and possible suspension or termination of licenses. The regulatory powers of the Commissioner of Insurance are designed to protect policyholders, not shareholders. While we cannot predict the terms of future regulation, the enactment of new legislation could affect the cost or demand of insurance policies, limit our ability to obtain rate increases in those cases where rates are regulated, otherwise restrict our operations, limit the expansion of our business, expose us to expanded liability or impose additional compliance requirements. In addition, we may incur additional operating expenses in order to comply with new legislation and may be required to revise the ways in which we conduct our business.\nFuture regulatory actions by the Commissioner of Insurance or other governmental agencies, including federal regulations, could have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could impact the value of our business model and result in potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe health care reform law and the implementation of that law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThe ACA provides comprehensive changes to the U.S. health care system, which are being phased in at various stages through 2018. The legislation imposes an annual insurance industry assessment of $8 billion in 2014, which will increase to $14.3 billion by 2018, with increasing annual amounts thereafter based on premium growth. Such assessment may not be deductible for income tax purposes. If the cost of the federal premium tax is not included in the calculation of our rates, or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new tax, our results of operations, financial position and liquidity may be materially adversely affected. Also, health plans serving the individual market are subject to the guaranteed issue provisions under which the plans are required to issue coverage to individuals without regard to their health status of pre-existing conditions, which could lead to adverse selection by consumers. On July 16, 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services sent a letter or the Commissioner of Insurance of Puerto Rico notifying that guarantee issue provisions under ACA are not applicable to U.S. territories. However, on July 22, 2013, similar guarantee issue and other market reforms provisions were enacted in Puerto Rico as part of amendments made to the Health Insurance Code of Puerto Rico. If we are unable to adapt our premium structure to address the guaranteed issue requirement, our results of operations, financial position and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.\nThere are numerous outstanding steps required to implement the legislation, including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations. Further, various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level. This legislation could impact us through potential disruption to the employer-based market, potential cost shifting in the health care delivery system to insurance companies and limitations on the ability to increase premiums to meet costs. Because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them, we cannot predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities.\nAlthough we believe the legislation may provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business, the implementation of enacted reforms, such as the continued cuts in the effective Medicare Advantage rates applicable to our plans which are expected to be phased in for our plans through 2017, and the expected sunset of the adittional federal funding of Medicaid granted to Puerto Rico and the other US Territories under ACA in 2019, as well as future regulations and legislative changes, may in fact have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of health care reform, or do not do so as effectively as our competitors, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nAs a Medicare Advantage program participant, we are subject to complex regulations If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be exposed to criminal sanctions and significant civil penalties, and our Medicare Advantage contracts may be terminated or our operations may be required to change in a manner that has a material impact on our business.\nThe laws and regulations governing Medicare Advantage program participants are complex, subject to interpretation and frequent change and can expose us to penalties for non-compliance. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties or other sanctions, including the termination of our Medicare Advantage contracts. In addition, maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations as they change may, in some cases, entail substantial direct costs. For example, recently adopted CMS regulations effective in 2016 will require Medicare Advantage plans to develop, maintain, and implement a business continuity plan that meets certain minimum standards.\nUnder CMS regulations to implement certain ACA requirements that became effective on June 1, 2012, CMS has the authority not to renew our contracts the beginning in 2015 based solely on the Star Ratings of our Medicare Advantage plans if their respective ratings do not achieve three or more stars (out of five stars) for at least one of the three consecutive contract years. See the subcaption \u201cFederal regulations\u201d in Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K for detailed information of the Stars Ratings. By memorandum to select Medicare Advantage organizations and Part D plans dated September 8, 2014, CMS stated that it would not exercise its discretionary authority to terminate contracts held by a Medicare Advantage organization or Part D plan on this basis for 2015. However, CMS indicated that it does intend to exercise this authority to terminate contracts at the end of 2015 with any Medicare Advantage or Part D plan that does not meet this Star Rating requirement with respect to contract year 2016.\nEffective December 31, 2014, TSS entered into a novation agreement with CMS and TSA to transfer their three Medicare Advantage contracts to TSA. As part of this corporate reorganization, TSA currently has two Medicare Advantage plans. Historically, the TSA plans have received annual Star Ratings of three or more stars. As a result, in certain years the TSA plans have received a quality bonus from CMS.\nWe are devoting the resources and management attention we believe necessary to improve our Star Ratings of all our plans in order to avoid termination, but may not be successful in maintaining TSA plans\u2019 Star Ratings at 3 stars or higher. In case any of our Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS is terminated, we are identifying alternatives consistent with the direction provided by CMS regulation to retain lives by offering them enrollment in similar or superior products. Our failure to achieve Star Ratings of 3 or higher for each of our Medicare Advantage plans, or to otherwise improve our administration of these plans, would jeopardize our ability to attract and retain members in these plans, as well as our ability to continue to participate in these federal programs and to successfully bid for future CMS contracts in these programs.\nIn addition, CMS has the existing authority to terminate any of our Medicare Advantage contracts if it determines that any of these plans has failed to substantially carry out the contract or is carrying out the contract in a manner that is inconsistent with the efficient or effective administration of the Medicare Advantage program. Any termination or non-renewal of our Medicare Advantage plans would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nFrom April 30, 2012 through May 4, 2012, the Medicare Advantage programs of TSS and TSA were audited by CMS. This full performance audit review focused on our organization performance in Part D formulary and benefit administration, Part D coverage determinations, appeals and grievances, Part C organizational determinations, appeals and grievances, and dismissals, agent/broker oversight, Part C access to care, Part C and Part D enrollment, disenrollment, late enrollment penalty and compliance program effectiveness. On May 10, 2012, as part of these audits, CMS notified Triple-S Salud that it was noncompliant with multiple CMS drug formulary administration requirements and beneficiary coverage determination, appeals and grievances requirements. On October 9, 2012, CMS imposed a $350,000 civil monetary penalty on TSS for the formulary and benefit administration violations discovered during the audit, as well as for noncompliance with CMS disenrollment requirements. The TSA plan was not subject to any sanctions.\nCMS conducted several validation studies to determine whether the immediate corrective action plans (\u201cCAPs\u201d) were effective in remedying the deficiencies discovered at TSS during the audit. On October 17, 2012 CMS notified TSS that it passed the second validation study for the CAP related to Part D coverage determinations, appeals and grievances. Also on October 17, 2012, CMS issued a draft report of its TSS and TSA plan audits. The report contained various findings in all five plans. Our response to the report was issued on January 30, 2013.\nDuring 2013, CMS issued engagement letters to TSS and TSA to review the validation processes for their respective Medicare Advantage products, including TSS\u2019s Part D product. CMS review went through the corrective measures we implemented in connection with the findings issued during CMS\u2019s audit in 2012. This review on the validation processes was completed and we are waiting CMS\u2019s closing letter on this matter.\nWe may be subject to government audits, regulatory proceedings or investigative actions, which may find that our policies, procedures, practices or contracts are not compliant with, or are in violation of, applicable healthcare regulations.\nFederal and Puerto Rico government authorities, including but not limited to the Commissioner of Insurance, ASES, CMS, the OIG, the Office of the Civil Rights of HHS, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the OPM, regularly make inquiries and conduct audits concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. In addition, beginning in Medicare contract year 2016, CMS will have the right to require Medicare Advantage plan sponsors such as us to hire an independent auditor, working in accordance with CMS specifications, to validate if the deficiencies that were found during a CMS full or partial program audit have been corrected and provide CMS with a copy of the audit findings. If, in the future, we were required by CMS to hire an independent auditor, such audit would entail direct costs to us, in addition to potential penalties in the event of negative audit findings. We may also become the subject of non-routine regulatory or other investigations or proceedings brought by these or other authorities, and our compliance with and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged. In addition, our regulatory compliance may also be challenged by private citizens under the \u201cwhistleblower provisions\u201d of applicable laws. The defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost, diversion of resources, and a possible material adverse effect on our business.\nAn adverse action could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022 recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts;\n\u2022 mandated changes in our business practices;\n\u2022 imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, fines or other sanctions on us and/or our key employees;\n\u2022 loss or non-renewal of our government contracts or loss of our ability to participate in Medicare or other federal or local governmental payor programs; damage to our reputation;\n\u2022 increased difficulty in marketing our products and services;\n\u2022 inability to obtain approval for future services or geographic expansions; and\n\u2022 loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurance company, preferred provider or managed care organization or other licensed entity or to otherwise provide a service.\nOur failure to maintain an effective corporate compliance program may increase our exposure to civil damages and penalties, criminal sanctions and administrative remedies, such as program exclusion, resulting from an adverse review. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could reduce our revenue and profitability and otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nEffective prevention, detection and control systems are critical to maintain regulatory compliance and prevent fraud and failure of these systems could adversely affect the Company.\nFailure to prevent, detect or control systems related to regulatory compliance or the failure of employees to comply with our internal policies, including data systems security or unethical conduct by managers and employees, could adversely affect our reputation and also expose it to litigation and other proceedings, fines and penalties. Federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care and other insurance fraud and abuse a priority. Fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services, improper marketing, and violations of patient privacy rights. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the Company are complex and subject to change. In addition, ongoing vigorous law enforcement, a highly technical regulatory scheme and the Dodd-Frank legislation and related regulations being adopted that enhance regulators\u2019 enforcement powers and whistleblower incentives and protections, mean that its compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources.\nIn addition, provider or member fraud that is not prevented or detected could impact our medical costs or those of our self-insured customers. Further, during an economic downturn, our segments, including our Life Insurance and Property and Casualty segments may see increased fraudulent claims volume which may lead to additional costs because of an increase in disputed claims and litigation.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to address emerging security threats or detect and prevent privacy and security incidents, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. HIPAA regulations also provide access rights and other rights for health plan beneficiaries with respect to their health information. These regulations include standards for certain electronic transactions, including encounter and claims information, health plan eligibility and payment information. Health plans are also subject to beneficiary notification and remediation obligations in the event of an authorized use or disclosure of personal health information. HIPAA also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls, we still have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices.\nOur facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses; coordinated attacks by activist entities; emerging cybersecurity risks; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events. Emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations.\nCompliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain our ability to manage our business model. For example, final HHS regulations released in January 2013 implementing the ARRA amendments to HIPAA may further restrict our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and may impose additional compliance requirements on our business. In addition, HHS has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities. Although we are not aware of HHS plans to audit any of our covered entities, an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are also subject to Puerto Rico Act No. 194 of August 25, 2000, also known as the Patient\u2019s Rights and Responsibilities Act, including provisions more stringent than HIPAA. There is uncertainty regarding many aspects of such state requirements which make compliance with applicable health information laws more difficult. For these reasons, our total compliance costs may increase in the future.\nOn February 11, 2014, ASES notified TSS of its intention to impose a civil monetary penalty of $6.8 million dollars with respect to a breach involving the inadvertent display of protected health information of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. OCR has an open investigation on this matter. See, \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings-Unauthorized Disclosure of Protected Health Information\u201d for more information.\nNoncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including mandatory disclosure to the media, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, among other consequences, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe revised rate calculation system for Medicare Advantage, the payment system for the Medicare Part D and changes in the methodology and payment policies used by CMS to establish rates could reduce our profitability and the benefits we offer our beneficiaries.\nMedicare Advantage managed care plans are paid based off of a CMS-calculated \u201cbenchmark\u201d amount, and plans submit competitive bids that reflect the costs they expect to incur in providing the base Medicare benefits. A Medicare Advantage plan\u2019s actual payment rate is based on a complex statutory formula that takes into account a number of factors, including the relationship between the plan\u2019s bid and the benchmark. In addition, under the ACA, Medicare Advantage plan payment rates are subject to transitionally phased in reductions intended to bring Medicare Advantage rates more in line with Medicare fee-for-service rates, which are being phased in between 2012 and 2017. Medicare generally will rebate a portion of the amount by which the benchmark amount exceeded the accepted bid for certain plans. For plans achieving star rating of at least 3.5 stars, the portion of the savings retained by the plan is higher. For plans achieving star ratings of at least 4 stars, the starting benchmark amount from which the savings is computed is also higher (a \u201cquality bonus\u201d). However, Medicare\u2019s three year Quality Bonus Payment Demonstration, under which bonuses for some plans were higher than required by the ACA, and under which Medicare would also rebate a quality bonus to certain plans achieving star ratings of 3.0 or 3.5 stars, ended in 2014. If the bid is greater than the benchmark, the plan will be required to charge a premium to enrollees equal to the difference between the bid and the benchmark, which could affect our ability to attract enrollees. CMS reviews the methodology and assumptions used in bidding with respect to medical and administrative costs, profitability and other factors. CMS could challenge such methodology or assumptions or seek to cap or limit plan profitability. CMS also could administratively seek to implement certain methodological changes to the Medicare Advantage rate calculations that could result in functionally lower payment rates. For example, on February 20, 2015, CMS projected Medicare Advantage plan rates for contract year 2016, which would, if implemented, functionally reduce the overall payments to our Medicare Advantage plans, largely due to the continued transitional phase-in under the ACA intended to align Medicare Advantage payments with traditional fee-for-service Medicare, as noted above. The implementation of the proposed Medicare Advantage rates, if adopted, as well as the continued implementation of the ACA reduction of Medicare Advantage funding, which is expected to continue to be phased in through 2017, may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, financial position, results of operations or cash flow.\nA number of legislative proposals, as well as ACA, include efforts to save federal funds by implementing significant rate reductions to Medicare Advantage plans through changes in the competitive bidding process, tying the country benchmarks to Medicare fee for service expenditures, or other means.\nWe also face the risk of reduced or insufficient government funding and we may need to terminate our Medicare Advantage contracts with respect to unprofitable markets, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, as a result of the competitive bidding process, our ability to participate in the Medicare Advantage program is affected by the pricing and design of our competitors\u2019 bids. Moreover, we may in the future be required to reduce benefits or charge our members an additional premium in order to maintain our current level of profitability, either of which could make our health plans less attractive to members and adversely affect our membership.\nCMS\u2019s risk adjustment payment system and other Medicare Advantage funding pressures make our revenue and profitability difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments to our results of operations.\nCMS has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for Medicare Advantage plans to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for such plans to enroll and treat less healthy Medicare beneficiaries. CMS phased in this payment methodology with a risk adjustment model that bases a portion of the total CMS reimbursement payments mainly on demographic and the health severity of enrollees. The risk adjusted premiums we receive are based on claims and encounter data that we submit to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience, or other data, and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured, which are possible as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS, when the ultimate adjustment settlements are received from CMS, or we receive notification of such settlement amounts. CMS adjusts premiums on two separate occasions on a retrospective basis. The first retrospective adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year. This initial settlement represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year. CMS then issues a final retrospective risk adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year.\nCMS may make changes to the manner in which it determines risk adjustment payments. For example, in 2014, CMS asked Medicare Advantage plans to submit additional information indicating whether medical conditions were diagnosed in a clinical setting and CMS has indicated that it intends to publish further guidance as to the treatment of risk adjustment data in early 2015. Also, CMS has indicated that it intends to modify member-level risk scored for 2016. As a result of the risk adjustment process and CMS\u2019s ability to modify the manner in which it applies such risk adjustments, it is difficult to predict with certainty our future revenue or profitability. In addition, our own risk scores for any period may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustment to payment from CMS and our Medicare payment revenue. Finally, we generally rely on providers, including certain network providers who are our employees, to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis codes submitted with claims, as the basis for our risk scores under the program. Thus, our ability to meet our premium revenue estimates depends largely on the success of third party efforts to collect and properly reflect medical data, including diagnosis codes that must be submitted with claims. There is no assurance that our providers will be successful in accurately collecting such medical data and diagnosis codes and, to the extent their efforts are not successful, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our premium revenues. Further, the continued implementation of the ACA reduction of Medicare Advantage funding, which is expected to continue to be phased in through 2017, may have a material adverse effect on our premium revenues.\nIf during the open enrollment season our Medicare Advantage members enroll in another Medicare Advantage plan, they will be automatically disenrolled from our plan, possibly without our immediate knowledge.\nPursuant to the MMA, members enrolled in one insurer\u2019s Medicare Advantage program will be automatically disenrolled from that program if they enroll in another insurer\u2019s Medicare Advantage program. If our members enroll in another insurer\u2019s Medicare Advantage program we may not discover that such member has been disenrolled from our program until such time as we fail to receive reimbursement from CMS in respect of such member, which may occur sometime after the disenrollment. As a result, we may discover that a member has disenrolled from our program after we have already provided services to such individual. Our profitability would be reduced as a result of such failure to receive payment from CMS if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from them.\nMedicare and Medicaid spending by the federal government could be decreased as part of the spending cuts associated with the debt ceiling.\nThe Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-155) requires President Obama to submit to Congress a report on the potential sequestration triggered by the failure of the Joint Selective Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose, and Congress to enact, a plan to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion, as required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The sequestration resulted in cuts of 2% in aggregate Medicare payments beginning in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024, unless additional Congressional action is taken.\nWe cannot predict whether Congress will take any action to change the automatic spending cuts. Further, we cannot predict how states will react to any changes that occur at the federal level.\nIf we are deemed to have violated the insurance company change of control statutes in Puerto Rico, we may suffer adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to change of control statutes applicable to insurance companies. These statutes regulate, among other things, the acquisition of control of an insurance company or a holding company of an insurance company. Under these statutes, no person may make an offer to acquire or to sell the issued and outstanding voting stock of an insurance company, which constitutes 10% or more of the issued and outstanding stock of an insurance company, or of the total stock issued and outstanding of a holding company of an insurance company, or solicit or receive funds in exchange for the issuance of new shares of the holding company\u2019s or its insurance subsidiaries\u2019 capital stock, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of Insurance. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation (the articles) prohibit any institutional investor from owning 10% or more of our voting power and any person that is not an institutional investor from owning 5% or more of our voting power. We cannot, however, assure you that ownership of our securities will remain below these thresholds. To the extent that a person, including an institutional investor, acquires shares in excess of these limits, our articles provide that we will have the power to take certain actions, including refusing to give effect to a transfer or instituting proceedings to enjoin or rescind a transfer, in order to avoid a violation of the ownership limitation in the articles. If the Commissioner of Insurance determines that a change of control has occurred, we could be subject to fines and penalties, and in some instances the Commissioner of Insurance would have the discretion to revoke our operating licenses.\nWe are also subject to change of control limitations pursuant to our BCBSA license agreements. The BCBSA ownership limits restrict beneficial ownership of our voting capital stock to less than 10% for an institutional investor and less than 5% for a non-institutional investor, both as defined in our articles. In addition, no person may beneficially own shares of our common stock or other equity securities, or a combination thereof, representing a 20% or more ownership interest, whether voting or non-voting, in our company. This provision in our articles cannot be changed without the prior approval of the BCBSA and the vote of holders of at least 75% of our common stock.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital requirements. Our failure to meet these standards could subject us to regulatory actions.\nPuerto Rico insurance laws and the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance, among other things, require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital, thereby restricting the amount of earnings that can be distributed by our insurance subsidiaries to us. Although we are currently in compliance with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply in the future. Failure to maintain required levels of capital or to otherwise comply with the reporting requirements of the Commissioner of Insurance could subject our insurance subsidiaries to corrective action, including government supervision or liquidation, or require us to provide financial assistance, either through subordinated loans or capital infusions, to our subsidiaries to ensure they maintain their minimum statutory capital requirements.\nWe are also subject to minimum capital requirements pursuant to our BCBSA license agreements. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business-The termination or modification of our license agreements to use the BCBS name and mark could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nPuerto Rico insurance laws and regulations and provisions of our articles and bylaws could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider to be in their best interests and may make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and have the effect of entrenching management.\nPuerto Rico insurance laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and our articles and bylaws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur license agreements with the BCBSA require that our articles contain certain provisions, including ownership limitations. See \u201cRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry-If we are deemed to have violated the insurance company change of control statutes in Puerto Rico, we may suffer adverse consequences.\u201d\nOther provisions included in our articles and bylaws may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. In particular, our articles and bylaws:\n\u2022 permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u2022 divide our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022 limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on shareholders\u2019 ability to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022 impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; and\n\u2022 impose restrictions on shareholders\u2019 ability to amend our articles and bylaws.\nSee also \u201cRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry-If we are deemed to have violated the insurance company change of control statutes in Puerto Rico, we may suffer adverse consequences.\u201d\nPuerto Rico insurance laws and the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance may also delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. For instance, the Commissioner of Insurance must review any merger, consolidation or new issue of shares of capital stock of an insurer or its parent company and make a determination as to the fairness of the transaction. Also, a director of an insurer must meet certain requirements imposed by Puerto Rico insurance laws.\nThese voting and other restrictions may operate to make it more difficult to replace members of our board of directors and may have the effect of entrenching management regardless of their performance.", "PERMNO": 92506, "SIC": 6324, "TIC": "GTS"}
