{"cik": "1319161", "company": "Warner Music Group Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, certain risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely impact our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate and we may suffer reduced profits as a result.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, have experienced ongoing consolidation among major music companies and are driven by consumer preferences that are rapidly changing. Additionally, they require substantial human and capital resources. We compete with other recorded music companies and music publishers to identify and sign new recording artists and songwriters who subsequently achieve long-term success and to renew agreements with established artists and songwriters. In addition, our competitors may from time to time increase the amounts they spend to discover, or to market and promote, recording artists and songwriters or reduce the prices of their products in an effort to expand market share. We may lose business if we are unable to sign successful recording artists or songwriters or to match the prices of the products offered by our competitors. Our Recorded Music business competes not only with other recorded music companies, but also with the recorded music efforts of live events companies and recording artists who may choose to distribute their own works. Our Music Publishing business competes not only with other music publishing companies, but also with songwriters who publish their own works. Our Recorded Music business is to a large extent dependent on technological developments, including access to and selection and viability of new technologies, and is subject to potential pressure from competitors as a result of their technological developments. For example, our Recorded Music business may be further adversely affected by technological developments that facilitate the piracy of music, such as Internet peer-to-peer filesharing and CD-R activity, by an inability to enforce our intellectual property rights in digital environments and by a failure to develop successful business models applicable to a digital environment. The Recorded Music business also faces competition from other forms of entertainment and leisure activities, such as cable and satellite television, motion pictures and videogames in physical and digital formats.\nIf the recorded music industry fails to grow or streaming revenue fails to grow at a sufficient rate to offset download and physical sales declines, our prospects and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn the last several years, recorded music sales have been mainly flat with some slight growth following a long period of decline, while legal digital music has experienced rapid growth since 2003, and revenue streams from downloading and streaming have emerged. In fact, growth in digital sales offset declines in physical sales in 2015. Streaming revenue is important as it is offsetting declines in downloads and physical sales and represents a growing area of our Recorded Music business. According to IFPI, digital downloads accounted for 45% of global digital revenues in 2015. Streaming revenue, which includes revenue from ad-supported and subscription services, accounted for 42% of digital revenues in 2015, up 10 percentage points year-over-year. Although revenues from digital downloads fell by 10.5% in 2015, the decline was offset by an increase in streaming revenue, helping digital revenues grow by 10.2%. Streaming models comprise a range of margins. For some streaming models, our margins are superior to those for downloads and for others, our margins are slightly less. We expect these trends to continue to impact our results for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that this growth pattern will persist or that digital revenue will grow at a rate sufficient to offset declines in physical sales. A declining recorded music industry is likely to lead to reduced levels of revenue and operating income generated by our Recorded Music business. Additionally, a declining recorded music industry is also likely to have a negative impact on our Music Publishing business, which generates a significant portion of its revenues from sales and other exploitation of recorded music.\nThere may be downward pressure on our pricing and our profit margins and reductions in shelf space.\nThere are a variety of factors that could cause us to reduce our prices and reduce our profit margins. They are, among others, price competition from the sale of motion pictures and videogames in physical and digital formats, the negotiating leverage of mass merchandisers, big-box retailers and distributors of digital music, the increased costs of doing business with mass merchandisers and big-box retailers as a result of complying with operating procedures that are unique to their needs and any changes in costs or profit margins associated with new digital business, including the impact of ad-supported music services, some of which may be able to avail themselves of \u201csafe harbor\u201d defenses against copyright infringement actions under copyright laws. Due to \u201csafe harbor\u201d defenses, revenue from ad-supported music services do not fully reflect increases in consumption. In addition, we are currently dependent on a small number of leading digital music services, which allows them to significantly influence the prices we can charge in connection with the distribution of digital music. Over the course of the last decade, U.S. mass-market and other stores\u2019 share of U.S. physical music sales has continued to grow. While we cannot predict how future competition will impact music retailers, as the music industry continues to transform it is possible that the share of music sales by a small number of leading mass-market retailers such as Walmart and Target, as well as online retailers and digital music services such as Amazon, Apple Music and Google Play will continue to grow, which could further increase their negotiating leverage and put pressure on profit margins. See \u201c-We are substantially dependent on a limited number of digital music services, for the online sale of our music recordings and they are able to significantly influence the pricing structure for online music stores.\u201d\nOur prospects and financial results may be adversely affected if we fail to identify, sign and retain artists and songwriters and by the existence or absence of superstar releases and by local economic conditions in the countries in which we operate.\nWe are dependent on identifying, signing and retaining recording artists with long-term potential, whose debut albums are well received on release, whose subsequent albums are anticipated by consumers and whose music will continue to generate sales as part of our catalog for years to come. The competition among record companies for such talent is intense. Competition among record companies to sell and otherwise exploit records is also intense. We are also dependent on signing and retaining songwriters who will write the hit songs of today and the classics of tomorrow. Our competitive position is dependent on our continuing ability to attract and develop artists and songwriters whose work can achieve a high degree of public acceptance. Our financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to identify, sign and retain such artists and songwriters under terms that are economically attractive to us. Our financial results may also be affected by the existence or absence of superstar artist releases during a particular period. Some music industry observers believe that the number of superstar acts with long-term appeal, both in terms of catalog sales and future releases, has declined in recent years. Additionally, our financial results are generally affected by the worldwide economic and retail environment, as well as the appeal of our Recorded Music catalog and our Music Publishing library to consumers.\nWe may have difficulty addressing the threats to our business associated with digital piracy.\nThe combined effect of the decreasing cost of electronic and computer equipment and related technology such as the conversion of music into digital formats have made it easier for consumers to obtain and create unauthorized copies of our recordings in the form of, for example, MP3 files. For example, about 95% of the music downloaded in 2008, or more than 40 billion files, were illegal and not paid for, according to IFPI\u2019s 2009 Digital Music Report. Separately, data provided by comScore and Nielsen and publicly cited on IFPI\u2019s website indicates that 20% of Internet users globally still access unauthorized digital sites/services on desktop-based devices on a regular basis. In addition, while growth of music-enabled mobile consumers offers distinct opportunities for music companies such as ours, it also opens the market up to risks from behaviors such as \u201csideloading\u201d and mobile app-based downloading of unauthorized content. As the business shifts to streaming music or access models, piracy in these models is increasing. For example, the practice of \u201cstream-ripping,\u201d where websites or software programs enable end-users to obtain an unauthorized copy of the audio file associated with a music video, is a growing practice among young people and in parts of the world with high mobile data costs. Research conducted by Ipsos, a recognized third-party market research firm, in conjunction with IFPI, reflects that 30% of consumers across 13 key countries engaged in stream-ripping activity in 2016, with incidence rising to 49% among 16 - 24 year olds. A substantial portion of our revenue comes from the sale of audio products and streaming services that are potentially subject to unauthorized consumer copying and widespread digital dissemination without an economic return to us. The impact of digital piracy on legitimate music sales and subscriptions is hard to quantify but we believe that illegal filesharing and other forms of unauthorized activity have a substantial negative impact on music sales. We are working to control this problem in a variety of ways including by litigation, by lobbying governments for new, stronger copyright protection laws and more stringent enforcement of current laws, through graduated response programs achieved through cooperation with ISPs and legislation being advanced or considered in many countries, through technological measures and by enabling legitimate new media business models. We cannot give any assurances that such measures will be effective. If we fail to obtain appropriate relief through the judicial process or the complete enforcement of judicial decisions issued in our favor (or if judicial decisions are not in our favor), if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to lobby governments to enact and enforce stronger legal penalties for copyright infringement or if we fail to develop effective means of protecting our intellectual property (whether copyrights or other rights such as patents, trademarks and trade secrets) or our entertainment-related products or services, our results of operations, financial position and prospects may suffer.\nOrganized industrial piracy may lead to decreased sales.\nThe global organized commercial pirate trade is a significant threat to content industries, including the music sector. A 2011 study by Frontier Economics cited by IFPI, estimates that digitally pirated music, movies and software was valued at $30 billion to $75 billion and IFPI\u2019s 2015 Digital Music Report cited research conducted by MediaLink on behalf of the Digital Citizens Alliance that placed advertising revenues generated by 596 piracy sites at $227 million. Unauthorized copies and piracy have contributed to the decrease in the volume of legitimate sales. They have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business.\nLegitimate channels for digital distribution of our creative content are a fairly recent development, and their impact on our business is unclear and may be adverse.\nWe have positioned ourselves to take advantage of online and mobile technology as a sales distribution channel and believe that the continued development of legitimate channels for digital music distribution holds promise for us. Digital revenue streams of all kinds are important to offset continued declining revenue from physical CD sales. However, legitimate channels for digital distribution have existed for less than 20 years and we cannot predict their long-term impact on our business. In digital formats, certain costs associated with physical products such as manufacturing, distribution, inventory and return costs do not apply. Partially eroding that benefit are increases in mechanical copyright royalties payable to music publishers that only apply in the digital space.\nWhile there are some digital-specific variable costs and infrastructure investments necessary to produce and sell music in digital formats, we believe it is reasonable to expect that we will generally derive a higher contribution margin from digital sales than physical sales. However, we cannot be sure that we will generally continue to achieve higher margins from digital sales especially as an ever greater percentage of our digital revenue comes from sources other than downloads. Any legitimate digital distribution channel that does develop may result in lower or less profitable sales for us than comparable physical sales. In addition, the mix of digital services is changing and not all services will be equally remunerative. Ad-supported music services, some of which may be able to avail themselves of \u201csafe harbor\u201d defenses against copyright infringement actions under copyright laws, may be substitutional for more remunerative paid services. In addition, the transition to greater sales through digital channels has introduced uncertainty regarding the potential impact of the \u201cunbundling\u201d of the album on our business. In addition, if piracy continues unabated and legitimate digital distribution channels fail to continue to gain consumer acceptance, our results of operations could be harmed. Furthermore, as new distribution channels continue to develop, we may have to implement systems to process royalties on new revenue streams for potential future distribution channels that are not currently known. These new distribution channels could also result in increases in the number of transactions that we need to process. If we are not able to successfully expand our processing capability or introduce technology to allow us to determine and pay royalty amounts due on these new types of transactions in a timely manner, we may experience processing delays or reduced accuracy as we increase the volume of our digital sales, which could have a negative effect on our relationships with artists and brand identity.\nWe are substantially dependent on a limited number of digital music services for the online sale or other exploitation of our music and they are able to significantly influence the pricing structure for online music stores.\nWe derive an increasing portion of our revenues from sales of music through digital distribution channels. We are currently dependent on a small number of leading digital music services that sell consumers digital music. We have limited ability to increase our wholesale prices to digital service providers as a small number of digital service providers control much of the legitimate digital music business. If these providers were to adopt a lower pricing model or if there were structural changes to other pricing models, we may receive substantially less for our music, which could cause a material reduction in our revenues, unless it is offset by a corresponding increase in the number of transactions. We currently enter into short-term contracts with some digital music providers or provide our content on an at will basis to others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into new contracts with any digital music provider. Additionally, digital music services at present accept and make available for sale or other exploitation all the recordings that we and other distributors deliver to them. However, if digital music services in the future decide to limit the types or amount of music they will accept from music-based content owners like us, our revenues could be significantly reduced.\nOur involvement in intellectual property litigation could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon intellectual property, an area that has encountered increased litigation in recent years. If we are alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party, any litigation to defend the claim could be costly and would divert the time and resources of management, regardless of the merits of the claim. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such litigation. If we were to lose a litigation relating to intellectual property, we could be forced to pay monetary damages and to cease the sale of certain products or the use of certain technology. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business.\nDue to the nature of our business, our results of operations and cash flows may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nOur net sales, operating income and profitability, like those of other companies in the music business, are largely affected by the number and quality of albums that we release or that include musical compositions published by us, timing of release schedules and, more importantly, the consumer demand for these releases. We also make advance payments to recording artists and songwriters, which impact our operating cash flows. The timing of album releases and advance payments is largely based on business and other considerations and is made without regard to the impact of the timing of the release on our financial results. We report results of operations quarterly and our results of operations and cash flows in any reporting period may be materially affected by the timing of releases and advance payments, which may result in significant fluctuations from period to period.\nOur business operations in some foreign countries subject us to trends, developments or other events which may affect us adversely.\nWe are a global company with strong local presences, which have become increasingly important as the popularity of music originating from a country\u2019s own language and culture has increased in recent years. Our mix of national and international recording artists and songwriters provides a significant degree of diversification for our music portfolio. However, our creative content does not necessarily enjoy universal appeal. As a result, our results can be affected not only by general industry trends, but also by trends, developments or other events in individual countries, including:\n\u2022\nlimited legal protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of capital;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndifferences and unexpected changes in regulatory environment, including environmental, health and safety, local planning, zoning and labor laws, rules and regulations;\n\u2022\nvarying tax regimes which could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, including regulations relating to transfer pricing and withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and joint ventures;\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal standards and enforcement mechanisms and the associated cost of compliance;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees or rationalizing our workforce;\n\u2022\ntariffs, duties, export controls and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable settlement cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nrecessionary trends, inflation and instability of the financial markets;\n\u2022\nhigher interest rates; and\n\u2022\npolitical instability.\nWe may not be able to insure or hedge against these risks, and we may not be able to ensure compliance with all of the applicable regulations without incurring additional costs. For example, our results for the fiscal year 2016 were impacted by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. See \u201c-Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\u201d Furthermore, financing may not be available in countries with less than investment-grade sovereign credit ratings. As a result, it may be difficult to create or maintain profit-making operations in developing countries.\nIn addition, our results can be affected by trends, developments and other events in individual countries. There can be no assurance that in the future other country-specific trends, developments or other events will not have such a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in any given market and prompt promotional or other actions that affect our margins.\nOur business may be adversely affected by competitive market conditions and we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nWe expect to increase revenues and cash flow through a business strategy which requires us, among other things, to continue to maximize the value of our music assets, to significantly reduce costs to maximize flexibility and adjust to new realities of the market, to continue to act to contain digital piracy and to diversify our revenue streams into growing segments of the music business by entering into expanded-rights deals with recording artists and by operating our artist services businesses and to capitalize on digital distribution and emerging technologies.\nEach of these initiatives requires sustained management focus, organization and coordination over significant periods of time. Each of these initiatives also requires success in building relationships with third parties and in anticipating and keeping up with technological developments and consumer preferences and may involve the implementation of new business models or distribution platforms. The results of our strategy and the success of our implementation of this strategy will not be known for some time in the future. If we are unable to implement our strategy successfully or properly react to changes in market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain our executive officers.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continuing contributions of our executive officers, however, there is no guarantee that they will not leave. Some of our executive officers have employment arrangements. In fiscal year 2016, we did not have a direct employment arrangement with our CEO and certain of our other executive officers have at-will employment letters. Effective October 1, 2016, we began to pay our CEO as an employee but have not entered into an employment agreement with him. Our CEO and each of our executive officers who have at-will employment letters have elected to participate in the Warner Music Group Corp. Senior Management Cash Flow Plan, and the at-will employment letters were a condition to their participation in the Plan. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or the failure to attract other executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business or our business prospects.\nA significant portion of our revenues are subject to rate regulation either by government entities or by local third-party collection societies throughout the world and rates on other income streams may be set by governmental proceedings, which may limit our profitability.\nMechanical royalties and performance royalties are the two largest sources of income to our Music Publishing business and mechanical royalties are a significant expense to our Recorded Music business. In the United States, mechanical royalty rates are set every five years pursuant to an administrative process under the U.S. Copyright Act, unless rates are determined through voluntary industry negotiations, and performance royalty rates are set by performing rights societies and subject to challenge by performing rights licensees. Mechanical royalties are currently paid at a penny rate of 9.1 cents per song, per unit in the United States for physical formats (e.g., CDs and vinyl albums) and permanent digital downloads (recordings in excess of five minutes attract a higher rate) and 24 cents for ringtones. Outside the United States, mechanical and performance royalty rates are typically negotiated on an industry-wide basis. In most territories outside the United States, mechanical royalties are based on a percentage of wholesale prices for physical product and based on a percentage of consumer prices for digital products. The mechanical and performance royalty rates set pursuant to such processes may adversely affect us by limiting our ability to increase the profitability of our Music Publishing business. If the mechanical royalty rates are set too high it may also adversely affect us by limiting our ability to increase the profitability of our Recorded Music business. In addition, rates our Recorded Music business receives in the United States for webcasting and satellite radio are set every five years by an administrative process under the U.S. Copyright Act unless rates are determined through voluntary industry negotiations. It is important as sales shift from physical to diversified distribution channels that we receive fair value for all of the uses of our intellectual property as our business model now depends upon multiple revenue streams from multiple sources. The rates set for Recorded Music and Music Publishing income sources through legally prescribed rate-setting processes could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible and long-lived assets could negatively affect our operating results and equity.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had $1.627 billion of goodwill and $116 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Financial Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and other (\u201cASC 350\u201d) requires that we test these assets for impairment annually (or more frequently should indications of impairment arise) by first assessing qualitative factors and then by quantitatively estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units (calculated using a discounted cash flow method) and comparing that value to the reporting units\u2019 carrying value, if necessary. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, there is a potential impairment and additional testing must be performed. In performing our annual tests and determining whether indications of impairment exist, we consider numerous factors including actual and projected operating results of each reporting unit, external market factors such as market prices for similar assets and trends in the music industry. We performed an annual assessment, at July 1, 2016, of the recoverability of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles as of September 30, 2016, noting no instances of impairment. However, future events may occur that could adversely affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions and the impact of the economic environment on our operating results. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at our reporting units could also result in impairment charges on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the value of the acquired goodwill or acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets is impaired, our operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity could be adversely affected.\nWe also had $2.201 billion of definite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2016. Financial Accounting Standard Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC Topic 360-10-35, (\u201cASC 360-10-35\u201d) requires companies to review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. No such events or circumstances were identified during the year ended September 30, 2016. If similar events occur as enumerated above such that we believe indicators of impairment are present, we would test for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, we would perform the next step, which is to determine the fair value of the asset, which could result in an impairment charge. Any impairment charge recorded would negatively affect our operating results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. We have substantial assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. Prior to intersegment eliminations, 58% of our revenues related to operations in foreign territories for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. During the current fiscal year, we have hedged a portion of our material foreign currency exposures related to royalty payments remitted between our foreign affiliates and our U.S. affiliates.\nWe may not have full control and ability to direct the operations we conduct through joint ventures.\nWe currently have interests in a number of joint ventures and may in the future enter into further joint ventures as a means of conducting our business. In addition, we structure certain of our relationships with recording artists and songwriters as joint ventures. We may not be able to fully control the operations and the assets of our joint ventures, and we may not be able to make major decisions or may not be able to take timely actions with respect to our joint ventures unless our joint venture partners agree.\nThe enactment of legislation limiting the terms by which an individual can be bound under a \u201cpersonal services\u201d contract could impair our ability to retain the services of key artists.\nCalifornia Labor Code Section 2855 (\u201cSection 2855\u201d) limits the duration of time any individual can be bound under a contract for \u201cpersonal services\u201d to a maximum of seven years. In 1987, Subsection (b) was added, which provides a limited exception to Section 2855 for recording contracts, creating a damages remedy for record companies. Legislation was introduced in New York in 2009 to create a statute similar to Section 2855 to limit contracts between artists and record companies to a term of seven years which could be reduced to three years if the artist was not represented in the negotiation and execution of such contracts by qualified counsel experienced with entertainment industry law and practices. Such legislation could result in certain of our existing contracts with artists being declared unenforceable, or may restrict the terms under which we enter into contracts with artists in the future, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations. There is no assurance that California will not introduce legislation in the future seeking to repeal Subsection (b). The repeal of Subsection (b) and/or the passage of legislation similar to Section 2855 by other states could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe face a potential loss of catalog to the extent that our recording artists have a right to recapture rights in their recordings under the U.S. Copyright Act.\nThe U.S. Copyright Act provides authors (or their heirs) a right to terminate U.S. licenses or assignments of rights in their copyrighted works in certain circumstances. This right does not apply to works that are \u201cworks made for hire.\u201d Since the effective date of U.S. federal copyright protection for sound recordings (February 15, 1972), virtually all of our agreements with recording artists provide that such recording artists render services under a work-made-for-hire relationship. A termination right exists under the U.S. Copyright Act for U.S. rights in musical compositions that are not \u201cworks made for hire.\u201d If any of our commercially available sound recordings were determined not to be \u201cworks made for hire,\u201d then the recording artists (or their heirs) could have the right to terminate the U.S. federal copyright rights they granted to us, generally during a five-year period starting at the end of 35 years from the date of release of a recording under a post-1977 license or assignment (or, in the case of a pre-1978 grant in a pre-1978 recording, generally during a five-year period starting at the end of 56 years from the date of copyright). A termination of U.S. federal copyright rights could have an adverse effect on our Recorded Music business. From time to time, authors (or their heirs) have the opportunity to terminate our U.S. rights in musical compositions. However, we believe the effect of any potential termination is already reflected in the financial results of our Music Publishing business.\nIf we acquire, combine with or invest in other businesses, we will face certain risks inherent in such transactions.\nWe have in the past considered and will continue, from time to time, to consider, opportunistic strategic transactions, which could involve acquisitions, combinations or dispositions of businesses or assets, or strategic alliances or joint ventures with companies engaged in businesses that are similar or complementary to ours. Any such strategic combination could be material, be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly.\nAny future strategic transaction could involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\npotential loss of recording artists or songwriters from our rosters;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the acquired businesses or segregating assets to be disposed of;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown and/or contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the acquisition, disposition and/or against any businesses we may acquire;\n\u2022\nreputational or other damages to our business as a result of a failure to consummate such a transaction for, among other reasons, failure to gain anti-trust approval; and\n\u2022\nchanging our business profile in ways that could have unintended consequences.\nIf we enter into significant strategic transactions in the future, related accounting charges may affect our financial condition and results of operations, particularly in the case of any acquisitions. In addition, the financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Conversely, any material disposition could reduce our indebtedness or require the amendment or refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness or a portion thereof. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any strategic transactions. We cannot assure you that if we make any future acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or joint ventures or enter into any business combination that they will be completed in a timely manner, or at all, that they will be structured or financed in a way that will enhance our creditworthiness or that they will meet our strategic objectives or otherwise be successful. We also may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational, financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these transactions. Failure to effectively manage any of these transactions could result in material increases in costs or reductions in expected revenues, or both. In addition, if any new business in which we invest or which we attempt to develop does not progress as planned, we may not recover the funds and resources we have expended and this could have a negative impact on our businesses or our company as a whole.\nWe have outsourced our information technology infrastructure and certain finance and accounting functions and may outsource other back-office functions, which will make us more dependent upon third parties.\nIn an effort to make our information technology, or IT, more efficient and increase our IT capabilities and reduce potential disruptions, as well as generate cost savings, we outsource a significant portion of our IT infrastructure functions to a third-party. This outsourcing initiative is a component of our ongoing strategy to monitor our costs and to seek additional cost savings. As a result, we rely on third parties to ensure that our IT needs are sufficiently met. This reliance subjects us to risks arising from the loss of control over IT processes, changes in pricing that may affect our operating results, and potentially, termination of provisions of these services by our supplier. In addition, in an effort to make our finance and accounting functions more efficient, as well as generate cost savings, we outsource certain finance and accounting functions. A failure of our service providers to perform services in a satisfactory manner may have a significant adverse effect on our business. We may outsource other back-office functions in the future, which would increase our reliance on third parties.\nAdditionally, we are currently in the process of implementing substantial changes to our IT systems. We may not be able to successfully implement these systems in an effective manner. In addition, we may incur significant increases in costs and encounter extensive delays in the implementation and rollout of our new IT systems. If there are technological impediments, unforeseen complications, errors or breakdowns in implementing this new core operating system or if this new core operating system does not meet the requirements of our customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations or customer perceptions may be adversely affected.\nWe have engaged in substantial restructuring activities in the past, and may need to implement further restructurings in the future and our restructuring efforts may not be successful or generate expected cost savings.\nThe recorded music industry continues to undergo substantial change. These changes continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Following the 2004 acquisition of substantially all of the interests of the recorded music and music publishing business of Time Warner, we implemented a broad restructuring plan in order to adapt our cost structure to the changing economics of the music industry. Since then, we have continued to shift resources from our physical sales channels to efforts focused on digital distribution, emerging technologies and other new revenue streams. In addition, in order to help mitigate the effects of the recorded music transition, we continue our efforts to reduce overhead and manage our variable and fixed-cost structure to minimize any impact. In addition, as PLG had meaningful operational overlap with our existing business we implemented a restructuring and integration plan and achieved cost savings in conjunction with the PLG Acquisition. In October 2016, we announced the creation of a new center of excellence for financial shared services in Nashville, Tennessee, which will combine our transactional financial functions in one location. To establish the new center, we will move some of our U.S. departments to Nashville.\nWe cannot be certain that we will not be required to implement further restructuring activities, make additions or other changes to our management or workforce based on other cost reduction measures or changes in the markets and industry in which we compete. Our inability to structure our operations based on evolving market conditions could impact our business. Restructuring activities can create unanticipated consequences and negative impacts on the business, and we cannot be sure that any ongoing or future restructuring efforts will be successful or generate expected cost savings.\nAccess, which indirectly owns all of our outstanding capital stock, controls our company and may have conflicts of interest with the holders of our debt or us in the future. Access may also enter into, or cause us to enter into, strategic transactions that could change the nature or structure of our business, capital structure or credit profile.\nAs a result of the Merger, affiliates of Access indirectly own all of our common stock, and the actions that Access undertakes as our sole ultimate shareholder may differ from or adversely affect the interests of debt holders. Because Access ultimately controls our voting shares and those of all of our subsidiaries, it has the power, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as well as to elect our directors and those of our subsidiaries, to change our management and to approve any other changes to our operations. In addition, Access previously set the compensation for Stephen Cooper, our CEO, pursuant to an arrangement between Mr. Cooper and Access, and we reimbursed Access for any compensation paid to Mr. Cooper pursuant to the Management Agreement. As of October 1, 2016, Mr. Cooper became an employee of ours paid directly by the Company. Access also provides us with financial, investment banking, management, advisory and other services pursuant to the Management Agreement, for which we pay Access a specified annual fee, plus expenses, and a specified transaction fee for certain types of transactions completed by Holdings or one or more of its subsidiaries, plus expenses. Access also has the power to direct us to engage in strategic transactions, with or involving other companies in our industry, including acquisitions, combinations or dispositions, and the acquisition of certain assets that may become available for purchase, and any such transaction could be material. Any such transaction would carry the risks set forth above under \u201c-If we acquire, combine with or invest in other businesses, we will face certain risks inherent in such transactions.\u201d\nAdditionally, Access is in the business of making investments in companies and is actively seeking to acquire interests in businesses that operate in our industry and may compete, directly or indirectly, with us. Access may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, which could have the effect of making such acquisition opportunities unavailable to us. Access could elect to cause us to enter into business combinations or other transactions with any business or businesses in our industry that Access may acquire or control, or we could become part of a group of companies organized under the ultimate common control of Access that may be operated in a manner different from the manner in which we have historically operated. Any such business combination transaction could require that we or such group of companies incur additional indebtedness, and could also require us or any acquired business to make divestitures of assets necessary or desirable to obtain regulatory approval for such transaction. The amounts of such additional indebtedness, and the size of any such divestitures, could be material. Access may also from time to time purchase outstanding debt securities that we issued, and could also subsequently sell any such debt securities. Any such purchase or sale may affect the value of, trading price or liquidity of our debt securities. We may also, from time to time, pay dividends to our stockholders within the requirements of our debt agreements and applicable law. If we were to pay dividends, the funds used to make such dividend payments would not be available to service our indebtedness.\nFinally, because neither we nor our parent company have any securities listed on a securities exchange, we are not subject to certain of the corporate governance requirements of any securities exchange, including any requirement to have any independent directors.\nEvolving regulations concerning data privacy may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could increase the costs of operations or limit our activities.\nWe engage in a wide array of online activities and are thus subject to a broad range of related laws and regulations including, for example, those relating to privacy, consumer protection, data retention and data protection, online behavioral advertising, geo-location tracking, text messaging, e-mail advertising, mobile advertising, content regulation, defamation, age verification, the protection of children online, social media and other Internet, mobile and online-related prohibitions and restrictions. The regulatory framework for privacy and data security issues worldwide has become increasingly burdensome and complex, and is likely to continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission, security and disclosure of personal information by companies operating over the Internet and mobile platforms are receiving ever-increasing public scrutiny. The U.S. government, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for even greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet and mobile platforms, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices, the use of location data and disclosures of privacy practices in the online and mobile environments, including with respect to online and mobile applications. State governments are engaged in similar legislative and regulatory activities. In addition, privacy and data security laws and regulations around the world are being implemented rapidly and evolving. These new and evolving laws are likely to result in greater compliance burdens for companies with global operations. Globally, many government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices with respect to information collected from consumers.\nIn October 2012, one of our subsidiaries entered into a consent agreement to settle certain Federal Trade Commission charges that it violated the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) by improperly collecting personal information from children under 13 without their parents\u2019 verifiable consent. While our subsidiary neither admitted nor denied the agency\u2019s allegations, the settlement imposed a $1 million civil penalty, barred future violations of COPPA, and required that our subsidiary delete information allegedly collected in violation of COPPA, among other requirements.\nThe Federal Trade Commission adopted certain revisions to its rule promulgated pursuant to COPPA, effective as of July 1, 2013, that may impose greater compliance burdens on us. COPPA imposes a number of obligations, such as obtaining verifiable parental permission on operators of websites, apps and other online services to the extent they collect certain information from children who are under 13 years of age. The changes broaden the applicability of COPPA, including by expanding the definition of \u201cpersonal information\u201d subject to the rule\u2019s parental consent and other obligations.\nIn addition, our business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if laws or regulations are adopted, interpreted, or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the collection, use or disclosure of customer data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such collection, use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our operations, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services, mechanisms, platforms and features that make use of data regarding our customers and potential customers.\nIf we or our service providers do not maintain the security of information relating to our customers, employees and vendors and our music-based content, security information breaches through cyber security attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers, employees, vendors and artists, and we could incur substantial additional costs, become subject to litigation and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, even if we or our service providers maintain such security, such breaches remain a possibility due to the fact that no data security system is immune from attacks or other incidents.\nWe receive certain personal information about our customers and potential customers, and we also receive personal information concerning our employees, artists and vendors. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. We maintain security measures with respect to such information, but despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and others that attempt to penetrate the security measures that we have in place. A compromise of our security systems (through cyber-attacks or otherwise which are rapidly evolving and sophisticated) that results in personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, potential customers, employees, artists and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of governmental penalties. We may also be subject to cyber-attacks that target our music-based content, including not-yet-released songs or albums. The theft and premature release of this music-based content may adversely affect our reputation with current and potential artists and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations.\nWe increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, resulting in less direct control over our data. Such third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, which could adversely affect our reputation.\nRisks Related to our Leverage\nOur substantial leverage on a consolidated basis could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of September 30, 2016, our total consolidated indebtedness, including the current portion, was $2.812 billion. In addition, we would have been able to borrow up to $145 million under our Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016 (giving effect to approximately $5 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016).\nOur high degree of leverage could have important consequences for our investors. For example, it may:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions and periods of significant inflation and financial market volatility;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings we make under the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facilities will bear interest at variable rates;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all or borrow additional funds in the future for, among other things, working capital, acquisitions or debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the indentures governing our outstanding notes as well as under the Senior Credit Facilities. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nThe indentures that govern our outstanding notes and the Senior Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Those covenants include restrictions on our ability to, among other things, incur more indebtedness, pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions, make investments, create liens, transfer or sell assets, merge or consolidate and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. See also \u201c-Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\u201d\nAcquisition Corp. may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nAcquisition Corp.\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance its debt obligations depends on its financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Acquisition Corp. may not maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nAcquisition Corp. will rely on its subsidiaries to make payments on its borrowings. If these subsidiaries do not dividend funds to Acquisition Corp. in an amount sufficient to make such payments, if necessary in the future, Acquisition Corp. may default under the indentures or credit facilities governing its borrowings, which would result in all such borrowings becoming due and payable.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make certain other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the credit agreements governing the Senior Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility contain a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\npay dividends on, and redeem and purchase, equity interests;\n\u2022\nmake other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake prepayments on, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans and investments;\n\u2022\nincur certain additional debt;\n\u2022\nenter into guarantees and hedging arrangements;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nchange the business we and our subsidiaries conduct;\n\u2022\nrestrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions;\n\u2022\namend the terms of subordinated debt and unsecured bonds; and\n\u2022\nmake certain capital expenditures.\nOur ability to borrow additional amounts under the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facilities depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants. In addition, under the credit agreement governing the revolving portion of our Senior Credit Facilities, a financial maintenance covenant is applicable if more than $30 million is drawn at the end of a quarter.\nOur failure to comply with obligations under the instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nAll of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business or may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in recording artists and songwriters, capital expenditures or dividends, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indentures governing our outstanding notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. While subject to certain restrictions in our debt agreements, if we were to pay dividends to our shareholders, the funds used to make such dividend payments would not be available to service our indebtedness.\nDespite our indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The indentures governing our outstanding notes and the credit agreements governing the Senior Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility will not fully prohibit us, Holdings or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness under certain circumstances. If we, Holdings or our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in such indentures, we, Holdings or our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness.\nOur ability to incur secured indebtedness is subject to compliance with certain secured leverage ratios that are calculated as of the date of incurrence. The amount of secured indebtedness that we are able to incur and the timing of any such incurrence under these ratios vary from time to time and are a function of several variables, including our outstanding indebtedness and our results of operations calculated as of specified dates or for certain periods.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us could cause the liquidity or market value of our indebtedness to decline and our cost of capital to increase.\nAny future lowering of our ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. Therefore, although reductions in our debt ratings may not have an immediate impact on the cost of debt or our liquidity, they may impact the cost of debt and liquidity over the medium term and future access at a reasonable rate to the debt markets may be adversely impacted.", "PERMNO": 90699, "SIC": 3652, "TIC": "WMG"}
