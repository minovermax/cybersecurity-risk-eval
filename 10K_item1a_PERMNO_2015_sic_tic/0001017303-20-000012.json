{"cik": "1017303", "company": "TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, as well as other disclosures in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, because they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may also impair our business operations. In the event that such risks or uncertainties materialize, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe assume no obligation (and specifically disclaim any such obligation) to update these Risk Factors or any other forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are likely to continue to vary due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results, the market price of our common stock will likely decline. Fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u25cf\ndelays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced products and consumables and the generation of sales from those products;\n\u25cf\nthe geographic distribution of our sales and our supply chain;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our products, both domestically and internationally;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment of new competitive products by others;\n\u25cf\nour responses to price competition;\n\u25cf\nour level of research and development activities;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the amount that we spend to develop, acquire or license new products, consumables, technologies or businesses;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the amount we spend to promote our products and services;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the cost of satisfying our warranty obligations and servicing our installed base of products;\n\u25cf\navailability of third-party components at reasonable prices;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates affecting returns on cash balances and investments, that affect customer demand;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations of world-wide oil and gas prices;\n\u25cf\nthe dependence of our supply chain on a few, foreign third-party manufacturers and suppliers;\n\u25cf\nsevere weather events, public health crises, and other external events out of our control that can disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 facilities; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting rules.\nDue to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this Form 10-K, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be an indicator of future performance.\nOur revenue and profitability depend on our ability to continue to develop, on a timely basis, new products and technologies which are free from hardware or software anomalies and cannot be fraudulently manipulated, and customer acceptance of such products.\nOur success depends upon our ability to timely adapt our capabilities and processes to meet the demands of producing new and innovative products. Because our newer products contain software and generally are more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past, we must continually refine our capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation. If we cannot efficiently adapt our infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations in a timely manner, our business could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, even if we successfully develop such products, there is no assurance that our innovations will be accepted by our customers. Developing and marketing new products, such as our BOHA! ecosystem, is costly, and our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to generate sales of such products or if our existing or new customers do not quickly accept such products. Customer acceptance is crucial because new products typically have very little competition and market penetration due to their novelty. Although we develop new products with the input of our customers, which has contributed to the early success of BOHA!, customer acceptance is never assured may take time to materialize.\nWe compete in highly competitive markets, which are likely to become more competitive. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements.\nWe face significant competition in developing and selling our printers, terminals, software, consumables and services. Our principal competitors have substantial marketing, financial, development and personnel resources. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to provide:\n\u25cf\ntechnologically advanced products that satisfy the user demands;\n\u25cf\nsuperior customer service;\n\u25cf\nhigh levels of quality and reliability; and\n\u25cf\ndependable and efficient distribution networks.\nWe cannot ensure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. Some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products. Any of these factors could reduce our earnings.\nOur success will depend on our ability to sustain and manage growth.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a growth strategy. Assuming this growth occurs, it will require the expansion of customer relationships in international markets, the successful development and marketing of new products for our existing and new markets, expanded internal sales and marketing, customer service and support, and the continued implementation and improvement of our operational, financial and management information systems.\nTo the extent that we seek growth through acquisitions, our ability to manage our growth will also depend on our ability to integrate businesses that have previously operated independently. We may not be able to achieve this integration without encountering difficulties or experiencing the loss of key employees, customers or suppliers. It may be difficult to design and implement effective financial controls for combined operations and differences in existing controls for each business may result in weaknesses that require remediation when the financial controls and reporting functions are combined. As we pursue acquisitions, we may incur legal, accounting and other transaction related expenses for unsuccessful acquisition attempts that could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy, or that we can successfully manage expanded operations, if they occur. As we expand, we may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion. Failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have been identified, and if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report thereon, we could be materially adversely affected.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 regarding our internal controls over user access to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user access to appropriate personnel. Specifically, the provisioning and user recertification controls are not designed to ensure users maintain proper segregation of duties and therefore could have inappropriate access rights. Additionally, we identified a material weakness in controls over key spreadsheets supporting our accounting records. Specifically, we did not design adequate controls to address the completeness and accuracy of information included in key spreadsheets. As a result of these material weaknesses, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019.\nUnless and until these material weaknesses have been remediated or should new material weaknesses arise or be discovered in the future, a material misstatement could occur and go undetected in our interim or annual consolidated financial statements. As a result, we may experience delays in fulfilling our reporting obligations or complying with federal securities laws, which could result in investigations and sanctions by regulatory authorities, including, but not limited to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), and may result in defaults or accelerations under our credit facility in the event that we are unable to timely file reports with the SEC, to the extent that in such an event, we are unable to obtain waivers from our lender. Any of these results could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nIn the casino and gaming market and the lottery market, we are dependent on sales to one large customer; the loss of this customer or reduction in orders from this customer could materially affect our sales.\nLottery and, to a lesser extent, casino and gaming sales to IGT have represented a material percentage of our net sales since 1995. A reduction, delay or cancellation in orders from this customer, including reductions or delays due to market, economic, or competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to general economic conditions. Uncertainty or negative trends in U.S. or international economic and investment climates, including the impact of Brexit and recent developments in U.S.-China trade relations (discussed separately below), could adversely affect our business. For example, customers or potential customers could reduce or delay orders, key suppliers and customers could become insolvent, which could result in production delays, and our customers may not be able to obtain credit. Any of these possible effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, create unabsorbed costs due to lower net sales, and ultimately decrease our net sales and profitability including write-downs of assets.\nFluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling and exploration activities by oil and gas companies and our revenue in our Printrex market. If oil and gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our Printrex products could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our Printrex products depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for drilling and exploratory activities, which are affected by short-term and long-term trends in oil and gas prices, including current and anticipated oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices, as well as the level of drilling and exploration, historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be highly volatile. If oil and gas prices continue to remain low or decline further, or if there is a further reduction in drilling and exploration activities, the demand for our Printrex products could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, a valuation allowance may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets.\nWe currently have deferred tax assets, which may be used to reduce taxable income in the future. We assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, and if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized, an income tax valuation allowance is recorded. If market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, or there is a change to applicable tax rules, future assessments may result in a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable. As a result, we may need to establish a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on distributors and resellers to sell our products and services.\nWe use a variety of distribution channels, including OEMs and distributors, to market and sell our products and services. We may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among our various sales channels.\nOur dependence upon distributors and resellers exposes us to numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\nloss of channel and the ability to bring new products to market;\n\u25cf\nconcentration of credit risk, including disruption in distribution should the distributors and / or resellers\u2019 financial condition deteriorate;\n\u25cf\nreduced visibility to end user demand and pricing issues which makes forecasting more difficult;\n\u25cf\ndistributors or resellers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing, payment and product delivery schedules; and\n\u25cf\ndirect competition should a distributor or reseller decide to manufacture printers internally or source printers from a competitor.\nWe cannot guarantee that resellers will not reduce, delay or eliminate purchases from us, which could have a material adverse effect upon the business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon two manufacturers located in China and Thailand for the manufacturing and assembly of our printers and terminals, and their operations have been disrupted by the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The impact of this disruption on the Company is uncertain at this time, but this disruption, and any further or future disruption in their businesses or operations, such as those caused by political, social or economic instability, trade restrictions or tariffs, severe weather, additional public health crises and other events out of our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn an effort to achieve additional cost savings and operation benefits, we have outsourced substantially all of the manufacturing and assembly of our printers and terminals to two contract manufacturers located in Asia. Approximately 80% of our printer and terminal manufacturing is conducted by one third-party manufacturer located in China, and an additional 19% is conducted by one other third-party manufacturers located in Thailand. As a result, we are dependent on them for the manufacturing of our products, and any disruption in such manufacturing or the export of products from these manufacturers to the U.S. may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks affecting the businesses and operations of our two manufacturers in Asia include: political and regional strife; war; labor shortages; severe weather and natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, and floods; lengthy power outages; increased pricing, financial instability and capacity constraints of shippers; and concerns with or threats of public health crises, contagious diseases or health epidemics. The risk to our business posed by any disruption in manufacturing is exacerbated by the concentration of our manufacturing operations in two manufacturers both located in Asia.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus was reported in China that has subsequently spread outside of China. In response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese government has placed restrictions on travel and mandated business closures. Such restrictions and closures have started to disrupt our supply chain by delaying product shipments from our contract manufacturers during 2020. Although the impact of such disruptions and delays has not had a material impact on our results of operations, there is significant uncertainty relating to the outbreak of coronavirus as well as the potential effects of such outbreak on our business.\nThe extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. Without the contract manufacturers continuing to manufacture our products and the continuing operation of the contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, we will have limited means for the final assembly of a majority of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility, which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. However, any such risk is partially offset by the current inventory of printing solutions maintained at our Ithaca, New York and, to a lesser extent, Las Vegas, Nevada facilities.\nWe may also incur increased business continuity and reputational risks to the extent that we continue to outsource the manufacturing and assembly of our products to foreign third-party service providers. For example, outsourcing of manufacturing prevents us from exercising control over the assembly of certain of our products and related operations or processes, including the internal controls associated with operations and processes conducted and the quality of our products assembled by contract manufacturers. If we are unable to effectively manage and oversee our outsourcing strategy, we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Outsourcing also exposes us to increased risk of infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property, to which our manufacturers have access. Because our manufacturers are located in Asia, there is no guarantee that our intellectual property rights will be protected or enforced to the same extent as under U.S. federal and state laws. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third-parties from developing or selling products made using our technologies.\nWe face risks associated with manufacturing forecasts.\nIf we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays, which could cause us to lose orders or customers and result in lower net sales. We currently use a rolling 12-month forecast based primarily on our anticipated product orders and our product order history to help determine our requirements for components and materials. It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead-time required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials.\nLead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, the size of the order, contract terms, and demand for each component at a given time. If we underestimate our requirements, we may have inadequate manufacturing capacity or inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and net sales. If we overestimate our requirements, we could have excess inventory of parts and finished products. In addition, delays in the manufacturing of our products could cause us to lose orders or customers.\nWe purchase component parts and consumable products from third-party and sole source suppliers, and any interference with this supply chain may impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nWe rely on third-party or sole source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products. We do not have guaranteed supply contracts with any of our component suppliers, and our suppliers could delay shipments, increase prices or cease manufacturing or selling such components to us at any time. A disruption in the supply of such component parts and consumable products could delay our production and/or the release of our new products and hinder our ability to meet our commitments to customers. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for the components, sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products. Any of these events could result in lost sales, reduced gross margins or damage to our end-customer relationships, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nIn addition to maintaining offices in the UK and Macau, we sell and ship a significant portion of our products internationally and rely on third parties that make up our global salesforce. The international nature of our operations may expose us to certain risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including risks posed by the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, tariffs, and changes in trade relations.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the United States. Shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales. In addition, our manufacturers and suppliers are largely located in Asia. As a result, our products are largely exported to one of our facilities in the United States, which makes our operations vulnerable to disruptions in trade that could adversely affect our business results.\nOur international operations, including our reliance on manufacturers and suppliers located in Asia, our worldwide sales team, and our sales to customers located outside the United States, expose us to disruptions in trade and other associated risks such as:\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of additional duties, tariffs, quotas, taxes, trade barriers, capital flow restrictions and other charges on imports and exports by the United States or the governments of the countries in which we or our manufacturers and suppliers operate;\n\u25cf\ndelays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations, labor disputes such as dock strikes, and our reliance on a limited number of shipping and air carriers, which may experience capacity issues that adversely affect our ability to ship inventory in a timely manner or for an acceptable cost;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, which could restrict sales, or increase costs of purchasing, in foreign countries;\n\u25cf\neconomic or political instability in any of the countries in which we or our manufacturers or suppliers operate, which could result in a reduction in demand for our products due to political and economic instability or impair our foreign assets;\n\u25cf\na reduced ability or inability to sell in or purchase from certain markets as a result of export or import restrictions;\n\u25cf\npotentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries, such as China, may limit recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories; and\n\u25cf\nreliance on a limited number of shipping and air carriers who may experience capacity issues that adversely affect our ability to ship inventory in a timely manner or for an acceptable cost; and\n\u25cf\neconomic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including inflation and recession).\nAlthough we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate, this insurance does not cover all possible situations. In addition, the business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact, both short-term and long-term, on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them.\nOutside of the United States we maintain offices in the UK and Macau. Effective January 31, 2020, the UK formally withdrew from the European Union. Following the UK\u2019s withdrawal, often referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d the UK entered a transition period, which is currently set to end on December 31, 2020. It is expected that the UK will negotiate a new free trade agreement with the European Union during this transition period. In the event that no such agreement is reached prior to the end of the transition period, the UK will have no international agreement governing its ongoing relationship with the EU.\nWe are still evaluating the impact of Brexit on our business, particularly as it relates to our UK subsidiary, during and after this transition period. Adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions and volatility in currency exchange rates could have a negative impact on the Company's operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the future trade relationship between the UK and the European Union remains uncertain, and any incremental regulatory controls and regulations governing trade between the UK and the European Union could have adverse consequences on the steel industry in the UK and/or the European Union and could negatively impact the Company's operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures, military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism.\nOur business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures, military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism. It is possible that terrorist attacks could be directed at important locations for the gaming industry. Heightened security measures and other efforts to combat terrorism may also have an adverse effect on the gaming industry by reducing tourism. Any of these developments could also negatively affect the general economy and consumer confidence. Any downturn in the economy in general, or in the gaming industry in particular could result in a reduced demand for our products and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, heightened security measures may cause certain governments to restrict the import or export of goods, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to buy and sell goods.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of which could materially impact our business.\nOur future success will depend in significant part upon the continued service of certain key management and other personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel. The loss of either Bart C. Shuldman, the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, or Steven A. DeMartino, the Company\u2019s President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, or the loss of certain groups of key employees, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our reputation, damage our business or interfere with our competitive position, and infringement on the intellectual property rights of others, or claims thereof, could put us at a competitive disadvantage, and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.\nOur intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages. Copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of our products or, without authorization, to obtain and use information which we regard as trade secrets.\nIn addition, prosecuting and defending infringement lawsuits is very expensive. We are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property rights, which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop. Similarly, third-parties may claim, from time to time, that we have violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third-party\u2019s patent or other intellectual property right, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method, if possible, to accomplish our objectives. Any such claims could result in costly litigation and, if successful, could result in costly judgments or settlements.\nThe expense of prosecuting or defending any future infringement lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Intellectual property litigation is generally complex, costly, protracted, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel.\nCyber-security and privacy breaches, cyber-attacks, or other disruptions could expose us to liability, affect our business, and damage our reputation.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We collect, store, and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information in connection with business operations. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack by third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, disgruntled current or former employees, and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our extensive security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee error or malfeasance. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. If our systems become compromised, we may not promptly discover the intrusion. Like other companies in our industry, we have experienced attacks to our data and systems, including malware and computer viruses that we have been able to detect and eliminate. If our systems fail or are breached or disrupted, we could lose product sales, and suffer reputational damage and loss of customer confidence. Such incidents would require notification to affected individuals and may result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Any one of these events could cause our business to be materially harmed and our results of operations to be adversely impacted.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that current laws, or any laws enacted in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in such laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors, such as:\n\u25cf\nchanges in our business, operations or prospects;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our relationships with our customers;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of new products or services by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncement or completion of acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in existing or adoption of additional government regulations;\n\u25cf\nunfavorable or reduced analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf\nprevailing domestic and international market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market may experience significant price fluctuations year-to-year. Broad market fluctuations, general economic conditions and specific conditions in the industries in which we operate may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nLimited trading volume and a reduction in analyst coverage of our common stock may contribute to its price volatility.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the average daily trading volume for our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market was approximately 19,000 shares. We are uncertain whether a more active trading market in our common stock will develop. In addition, many investment banks no longer find it profitable to provide securities research on micro-cap and small-cap companies. As a result, relatively small trades may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, which could increase the volatility and depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock in public or private offerings, and we may also issue additional shares of our common stock to finance future acquisitions. Shares of our common stock are also available for future sale pursuant to stock options and other equity awards that we have granted to our employees, and in the future, we may grant additional stock options and other forms of equity compensation to our employees. Sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings.", "PERMNO": 83910, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "TACT"}
