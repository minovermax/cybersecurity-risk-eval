{"cik": "1705771", "company": "Draper Oakwood Technology Acquisition Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this Report, including the financial statements. This Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and you are encouraged to perform your own investigation with respect to us and our business.\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nWe are a recently formed company with no operating history and, accordingly, you do not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a recently formed company with no operating results to date. Since we do not have an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is to consummate an initial business combination. We will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination.\nIf we are unable to consummate a business combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait until September 19, 2018 (or until March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) before receiving distributions from the trust account.\nWe have until September 19, 2018 (or until March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) in which to complete a business combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless (i) we consummate a business combination prior thereto or (ii) we seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummation of a business combination, and only then in cases where investors have sought to convert or sell their shares to us. Only after the expiration of this full time period will public security holders be entitled to distributions from the trust account if we are unable to complete a business combination. Accordingly, investors\u2019 funds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate their investment, public security holders may be forced to sell their public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nOur public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination.\nWe will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of franchise and income taxes payable), or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of franchise and income taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Accordingly, it is possible that we will consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our public shares do not approve of the business combination we consummate. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. For instance, Nasdaq rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such business combination instead of conducting a tender offer.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, after approval of our board, our sponsor has agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.\nUnlike some other blank check companies in which the initial stockholders agree to vote their founders\u2019 shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by the public stockholders in connection with an initial business combination, our sponsor has agreed (i) to vote any of the founders\u2019 shares and shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders\u2019 units held by the sponsor in favor of any proposed business combination, (ii) not to convert any such shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (iii) not to sell any such shares to us in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination. As a result, we would need only 2,132,001, or approximately 37.1%, of the 5,750,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of a transaction in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming (i) all shares were present and entitled to vote at the meeting and (ii) the 115,000 shares issued to EarlyBirdCapital, and the 54,500 shares underlying the EBC units purchased by EarlyBirdCapital (and its designees) upon the consummation of our initial public offering are issued and outstanding but not voted). Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval will be received than would be the case if our sponsor agreed to vote its founders\u2019 shares and shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders\u2019 units in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public stockholders.\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies.\nWe may be deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, since we had net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors of blank check companies such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors are not afforded the benefits or protections of those rules which would, for example, completely restrict the transferability of our securities and restrict the use of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. Because we are not subject to Rule 419, we are entitled to withdraw amounts from the funds held in the trust account prior to the completion of a business combination.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, a stockholder or a \u201cgroup\u201d of stockholders holding a substantial portion of our Class A common stock may influence our ability to complete our business combination.\nUnlike other blank check companies, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), holding in excess of a certain percentage of shares offered in our initial public offering will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any shares they hold in excess of such percentage. The ability of any such stockholder to redeem all their shares will increase their influence over our ability to complete our business combination and could make it more difficult for us to complete such business combination.\nIf we determine to change our acquisition criteria or guidelines, many of the disclosures contained in this Report would be rendered irrelevant and you would be investing in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire.\nWe could seek to deviate from the acquisition criteria or guidelines disclosed in this Report although we have no current intention to do so. For instance, we currently anticipate acquiring a target business with a consistent historical financial performance. However, we are not obligated to do so and may determine to merge with or acquire a company with no operating history if the terms of the transaction are determined by us to be favorable to our public stockholders. In such event, many of the acquisition criteria and guidelines set forth in this Report would be rendered irrelevant. We could also seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to provide us with more time to complete an initial business combination. Accordingly, investors may be making an investment in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire.\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 15,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 3,000,000 shares of Class F common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. There are currently 4,449,000 and 1,562,500 authorized but unissued shares of Class A and Class F common stock available, respectively, for issuance, which amount takes into account shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding rights (including founders\u2019 rights) and exercise of outstanding warrants (including insiders\u2019 warrants) and the underwriters\u2019 unit purchase option but not upon the conversion of the Class F common stock. Shares of Class F common stock are automatically convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination, initially at a one-for-one ratio but subject to adjustment as set forth herein. There are no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Although we have no commitment as of the date hereof, we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, or a combination of common stock and preferred stock, to complete a business combination. We may also issue shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of the Class F common stock at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained therein. The issuance of additional shares of common stock will not reduce the per-share conversion amount in the trust account. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\n\u25cf may significantly reduce the equity interest of existing investors;\n\u25cf may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf may cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock.\nSimilarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in:\n\u25cf default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25cf acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25cf our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and\n\u25cf our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding.\nIf we incur indebtedness, our lenders will not have a claim on the cash in the trust account and such indebtedness will not decrease the per-share conversion amount in the trust account.\nIf the net proceeds of our initial public offering not being held in trust are insufficient to allow us to operate until September 19, 2018 (or until March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time), we may be unable to complete a business combination.\nWe believe that the funds available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate until September 19, 2018 (or until March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time), assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates will be accurate. Accordingly, if we use all of the funds held outside of the trust account, we may not have sufficient funds available with which to structure, negotiate or close an initial business combination. In such event, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, officers or directors or their affiliates to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Our sponsor, officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount that they deem reasonable in their sole discretion for our working capital needs. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at holder\u2019s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000 shares of Class A common stock if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted since the 150,000 rights included in such units would result in the issuance of 15,000 shares upon the closing of our business combination, as well as 75,000 warrants to purchase 75,000 shares).\nWe do not have a specified maximum conversion threshold. The absence of such a conversion threshold may make it possible for us to complete a business combination with which a substantial majority of our stockholders do not agree.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum conversion threshold. Accordingly, as long as our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination (such that we are not subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules) or such greater amount as required by the terms in the agreement relating to our initial business combination, we may be able to complete our business combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than $10.00.\nOur placing of funds in trust may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we seek to have all vendors and service providers we engage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such agreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the trust account. A court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in trust could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete a business combination and distribute the proceeds held in trust to our public stockholders, our Chief Executive Officer, Aamer Sarfraz, has agreed (subject to certain exceptions described elsewhere in this Report) that he will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. However, he may not be able to meet such obligation. Therefore, the per-share distribution from the trust account may be less than $10.00, plus interest, due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00. We have not independently verified whether Mr. Sarfraz has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations. We have not asked Mr. Sarfraz to reserve for such indemnification obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will continue in existence only until September 19, 2018 (or until March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time). If we have not completed a business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that third parties will not seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after expiration of the time we have to complete an initial business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce Mr. Sarfraz\u2019s indemnification obligations, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and Mr. Sarfraz asserts that he is unable to satisfy his obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Sarfraz to enforce such indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Sarfraz to enforce such indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d provided that an exemption from registration is available. As a result, the number of shares of Class A common stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. Further, if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise on a cashless basis and would only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is available. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet these conditions and to file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to do so, the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless.\nAn investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of shares of Class A common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.\nNo warrants will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock unless the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon such exercise have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. If the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the warrants may be deprived of any value, the market for the warrants may be limited and they may expire worthless if they cannot be sold and may be subject to redemption.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding warrants.\nOur warrants are issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\nWe may amend the terms of the rights in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding rights.\nOur rights are issued in registered form under a right agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as rights agent, and us. The right agreement provides that the terms of the rights may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The right agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding rights in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\nUnlike other similarly structured blank check companies, our initial stockholder will receive additional Class A common stock if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination.\nThe founders\u2019 shares will automatically convert into Class A common stock on the first business day following the consummation of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities convertible or exercisable for Class A common stock, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in our initial public offering and related to the closing of the initial business combination, the ratio at which founders\u2019 shares shall convert into Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class F common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all founders\u2019 shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of all outstanding shares of common stock upon completion of the initial business combination (not including the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders\u2019 units or the 115,000 shares of common stock issued to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. upon the consummation of our initial public offering), excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any founders\u2019 units (and underlying securities) issued upon conversion of working capital loans, after taking into account Class A common stock redeemed in connection with the business combination. This is different from other similarly structured blank check companies in which the initial stockholder will only be issued an aggregate of 20% of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to the initial business combination. This may make it more difficult and expensive for us to consummate an initial business combination.\nBecause we are not limited to a particular industry or target business with which to complete a business combination, you are unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the industry or business in which we may ultimately operate.\nWe may consummate a business combination with a company in any industry we choose and are not limited to any particular industry or type of business, although we intend to focus on companies in the technology industry in North America. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate or the target business which we may ultimately acquire. To the extent we complete a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its development stage, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations of those entities. If we complete a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a target business.\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following a business combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct.\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future. In addition, none of our officers are required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, our officers have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\nThe role of our key personnel after a business combination, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may serve in senior management or advisory positions following a business combination, it is likely that most, if not all, of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\nOur officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business we may seek to acquire.\nWe may consummate a business combination with a target business in any geographic location or industry we choose, although we intend to focus on companies in the technology industry in North America. We cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have enough experience or have sufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding a business combination.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel will be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements or other appropriate arrangements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\nOur officers and directors allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination.\nOur officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which could create a conflict of interest when allocating their time between our operations and their other commitments. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. All of our officers and directors are engaged in other business endeavors and are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that these conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nOur officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for a business combination.\nOur sponsor, which is affiliated with certain of our officers and directors, has agreed to waive its right to convert its founders\u2019 shares, the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders\u2019 units, the founders\u2019 rights, the founders\u2019 warrants or any other shares purchased in our initial public offering or thereafter, or to receive distributions from the trust account with respect to its founders\u2019 shares or the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders\u2019 units, the founders\u2019 rights or the founders\u2019 warrants upon our liquidation if we are unable to consummate a business combination. Accordingly, the shares acquired prior to our initial public offering, as well as the founders\u2019 units and the securities underlying the founders\u2019 units, the founders\u2019 rights and the founders\u2019 warrants will be worthless if we do not consummate a business combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers, through their interests in our sponsor, may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders\u2019 best interest.\nCertain of our officers have, and any of our officers and directors or their affiliates may in the future have, fiduciary and contractual obligations and accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nCertain of our directors have, and any of our officers and directors or their affiliates may in the future have, fiduciary and contractual obligations to other companies. Accordingly, they may participate in transactions and have obligations that may be in conflict or competition with our consummation of our initial business combination. As a result, a potential target business may be presented by our management team to another entity prior to its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business.\nOur executive officers, directors, senior advisor, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, senior advisor, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors, executive officers or our senior advisor. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. We will be required to obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire if it is an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur securities are currently listed on Nasdaq, a national securities exchange. However, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future prior to an initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders\u2019 equity (generally $2,500,000) and a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 public holders). Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, it is likely that Nasdaq will require us to file a new initial listing application and meet its initial listing requirements as opposed to its more lenient continued listing requirements. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4 per share, our stockholders\u2019 equity would generally be required to be at least $5 million and we would be required to have 300 round lot holders. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our units, Class A common stock, rights and warrants are listed on Nasdaq, our units, Class A common stock, rights and warrants are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period exceeds $1 billion or revenues exceeds $1.07 billion, or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and we are exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock less attractive because we may rely on these provisions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our initial public offering, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services.\nIt is likely we will consummate a business combination with a single target business, although we have the ability to simultaneously acquire several target businesses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments.\nFurther, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\u25cf solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, or\n\u25cf dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination.\nAlternatively, if we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nThe ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights or sell their shares to us in a tender offer may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nIf our business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many stockholders may exercise conversion rights or seek to sell their shares to us in a tender offer, we may either need to reserve part of the trust account for possible payment upon such conversion, or we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. In the event that the acquisition involves the issuance of our stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our stock to make up for a shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business combination available to us.\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he is voting for or against such proposed business combination, to demand that we convert his shares into a pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. We may require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders\u2019 option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder\u2019s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, we cannot assure you of this fact. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their conversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.\nIf, in connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed business combination, we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares to comply with specific requirements for conversion, such converting stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination is not approved.\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System as described above and such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of common stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek conversion may be able to sell their securities.\nBecause of our structure, other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.\nWe have encountered and expect to encounter intense competition from entities other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours, including venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval or engaging in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination may delay the consummation of such a transaction. Additionally, our outstanding rights and warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a business combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.\nWe believe that the net proceeds of our initial public offering will be sufficient to allow us to consummate a business combination. We may use common or preferred equity to fund a material portion of the purchase price of our initial business combination. However, because we have not yet executed a definitive agreement with any specific target business with respect to a business combination, we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of our initial public offering prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of the business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, or the obligation to convert into cash a significant number of shares from dissenting stockholders, we will be required to seek additional financing. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, if we consummate a business combination, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our sponsor, officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after a business combination.\nOur initial stockholder controls a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\nOur initial stockholder owns approximately 22.0% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. None of our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase any units or shares of Class A common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates could determine in the future to make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions, to the extent permitted by law, in order to influence the vote or magnitude of the number of stockholders seeking to tender their shares to us. In connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, our sponsor, as well as all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote the shares of Class F common stock owned by them immediately before our initial public offering, the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders\u2019 units, as well as any shares of Class A common stock acquired in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed business combination.\nOur board of directors is divided into two classes, each of which generally serves for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There may not be an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of a business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the consummation of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our sponsor, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholder will continue to exert control at least until the consummation of a business combination.\nOur outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase options may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock and make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nWe issued rights to receive 575,000 shares of Class A common Stock and warrants to purchase 2,875,000 shares of Class A common stock in our initial public offering, founders\u2019 rights to purchase 27,250 shares of Class A common stock and founders\u2019 warrants to purchase 136,250 shares of Class A common stock and 250,000 warrants and rights to receive 50,000 shares of Class A common stock underlying the unit purchase options. We may also issue other units containing rights and warrants to our sponsor, officers or directors in payment of working capital loans made to us as described in this Report. To the extent we issue shares of Class A common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares upon exercise of these rights, warrants and unit purchase options could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business. Such securities, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, our rights, warrants and unit purchase options may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. Additionally, the sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the rights, warrants or unit purchase options could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these rights are converted or warrants and options are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nBecause each unit contains one-half of one warrant and one right to receive one-tenth of one share of Class A common stock, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies.\nEach unit contains one-half of one warrant and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Class A common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination. This is different from other blank check companies similar to ours whose units include one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants and rights upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable for, and the rights will be convertible into, a fraction of the number of shares in the aggregate, compared to units that each contain a warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if they included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $24.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third business day prior to proper notice of such redemption provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the founders\u2019 warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of Class A common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described elsewhere in this Report have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his warrant (including any warrants held by our sponsor, officers or directors, other purchasers of our founders\u2019 units, or their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of Class A common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company.\nWe have no obligation to net cash settle the rights or warrants.\nIn no event will we have any obligation to net cash settle the rights or warrants. Furthermore, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights or warrants upon consummation of an initial business combination or exercise of the warrants. Accordingly, you might not receive the shares of Class A common stock underlying the rights and warrants.\nIf our security holders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of Class A common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nOur stockholders prior to our initial public offering are entitled to make a demand that we register the resale of the founders\u2019 shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from escrow. Additionally, the holders of the founders\u2019 units and any units our sponsor, officers, directors, or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the founders\u2019 units and any other units we issue to them (and the underlying shares of Class A common stock) commencing at any time after we consummate an initial business combination, as well as any securities underlying any such units. The presence of these additional shares of Class A common stock trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business, as the stockholders of the target business may be discouraged from entering into a business combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities because of the potential effect the exercise of such rights may have on the trading market for our shares of Class A common stock.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination.\nA company that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Since we invested the proceeds held in the trust account, it is possible that we could be deemed an investment company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trustee only in United States \u201cgovernment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act.\nIf we are nevertheless deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be subject to certain restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete a business combination, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u25cf restrictions on the issuance of securities.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf registration as an investment company;\n\u25cf adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nCompliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense for which we have not allotted.\nIf we do not conduct an adequate due diligence investigation of a target business, we may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring, and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nWe must conduct a due diligence investigation of the target businesses we intend to acquire. Intensive due diligence is time consuming and expensive due to the operations, accounting, finance and legal professionals who must be involved in the due diligence process. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business, this diligence may not reveal all material issues that may affect a particular target business, and factors outside the control of the target business and outside of our control may later arise. If our diligence fails to identify issues specific to a target business, industry or the environment in which the target business operates, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our common stock. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing.\nOur sponsor may decide not to extend the term we have to consummate our initial business combination, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, and the warrants and rights will be worthless.\nWe have until September 19, 2018 to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by September 19, 2018, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (or until March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $575,000 ($0.10 per share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension (or up to $1,150,000 or $0.20 per share, if we extend for the full six months). Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loans will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable. If we do not complete a business combination, we will not repay such loans. Furthermore, the letter agreement with our initial stockholders contains a provision pursuant to which our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loans out of the funds held in the trust account in the event that we do not complete a business combination. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the warrants and rights will be worthless.\nThe requirement that we complete an initial business combination by September 19, 2018 (or by March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination.\nWe have until September 19, 2018 (or until March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) to complete an initial business combination. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete a business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete a business combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time limit referenced above.\nWe may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.\nWe must complete our initial business combination by September 19, 2018 (or by March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time). We may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination within such time period or we may be unable to consummate a business combination due to a downturn in industry or economic conditions or due to other factors that may occur. If we have not completed our initial business combination by September 19, 2018 (or by March 19, 2019 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nWe may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nWe will only be required to obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire if it is an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor. In all other instances, we will have no obligation to obtain an opinion. Accordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nResources could be spent researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nThe investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to complete a specific business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific target business, we may fail to consummate the business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and may require that we have such system of internal controls audited beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on management\u2019s evaluation of our system of internal controls. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nWe may effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States. If we did, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in the target business\u2019 home jurisdiction, including any of the following:\n\u25cf rules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\n\u25cf tariffs and trade barriers;\n\u25cf regulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\n\u25cf currency fluctuations and exchange controls;\n\u25cf challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf cultural and language differences;\n\u25cf employment regulations;\n\u25cf crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and\n\u25cf deterioration of political relations with the United States.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer.\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such company operates will govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations. We cannot assure you that the target business will be able to enforce any of its material agreements or that remedies will be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we acquire a company located outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under federal securities laws.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Our board of directors will be divided into two classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, at a given annual meeting only a minority of the board of directors may be considered for election. Since our \u201cstaggered board\u201d may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our board of directors at any given annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of stockholders. Moreover, our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nBecause we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards, we will not be able to complete a business combination with prospective target businesses unless their financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with any tender offer documents we use, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. Additionally, to the extent we furnish our stockholders with financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, such financial statements will need to be audited in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the time of the consummation of the business combination. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire.\nA market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions. Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAn investment in our securities may involve adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nAn investment in our securities may involve adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences. For instance:\n\u25cf because there are no authorities that directly address instruments similar to the units we are issuing in our initial public offering, the allocation an investor makes with respect to the purchase price of the unit among the share of Class A common stock, right and warrant included in the units could be challenged by the IRS or the courts.\n\u25cf if we make distributions on our common stock, such distributions generally will be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. The ability of a holder to seek conversion of their shares may be viewed as a position with respect to substantially similar or related property which diminishes your risk of loss and thereby affects your ability to satisfy the holding period requirements for the dividends received deduction or the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income with respect to the time period prior to the approval of an initial business combination.\n\u25cf our warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis in certain situations as described herein. Although there is no direct legal authority as to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an exercise of a warrant on a cashless basis, we intend to take the position that such exercise will not be taxable, either because the exercise is not a gain realization event or because it qualifies as a tax-free recapitalization. In the former case, the holding period of the common stock should commence on the day after the warrant is exercised. In the latter case, the holding period of the common stock would include the holding period of the exercised warrants. However, our position is not binding on the IRS and the IRS may treat a cashless exercise of a warrant as a taxable exchange.\n\u25cf any capital gain or loss you realize on a sale or other disposition of our common stock will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period for the common stock is more than one year. However, the conversion feature of the common stock could affect your ability to satisfy the holding period requirements for the long-term capital gain tax rate with respect to the time period prior to the approval of an initial business combination.\nWe may be subject to an increased rate of tax on our income if we are treated as a personal holding company.\nDepending on the date and size of our initial business combination, it is possible that we could be treated as a \u201cpersonal holding company\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a personal holding company for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a given taxable year if more than 50% of its ownership (by value) is concentrated, within a certain period of time, in five or fewer individuals (without regard to their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for this purpose certain entities such as certain tax-exempt organizations, pension funds, and charitable trusts), and at least 60% of its income is comprised of certain passive items.\nThere may be tax consequences to our business combination that may adversely affect us.\nWhile we expect to undertake any merger or acquisition so as to minimize taxes both to the acquired business and/or asset and us, such business combination might not meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization, or the parties might not obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of shares or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of substantial taxes.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThere are risks related to the technology industry to which we may be subject.\nBusiness combinations with companies with operations in the technology industry entail special considerations and risks. If we are successful in completing a business combination with a target business with operations in the technology industry, we will be subject to, and possibly adversely affected by, the following risks:\n\u25cf if we do not develop successful new products or improve existing ones, our business will suffer;\n\u25cf we may invest in new lines of business that could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\n\u25cf we will face significant competition and if we are not able to maintain or improve our market share, our business could suffer;\n\u25cf the loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could seriously harm our business;\n\u25cf if our security is compromised or if our platform is subjected to attacks that frustrate or thwart our users\u2019 ability to access our products and services, our users, advertisers, and partners may cut back on or stop using our products and services altogether, which could seriously harm our business;\n\u25cf mobile malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, spamming, and improper or illegal use of our products could seriously harm our business and reputation;\n\u25cf if we are unable to successfully grow our user base and further monetize our products, our business will suffer;\n\u25cf if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be seriously harmed;\n\u25cf we may be subject to regulatory investigations and proceedings in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a way that could seriously harm our business; and\n\u25cf components used in our products may fail as a result of a manufacturing, design, or other defect over which we have no control, and render our devices inoperable.\nAny of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our operations following a business combination. However, our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to the technology sector. Accordingly, if we acquire a target business in another industry, these risks will likely not affect us and we will be subject to other risks attendant with the specific industry in which we operate or target business which we acquire, none of which can be presently ascertained.", "PERMNO": 16980, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "RBZHF"}
