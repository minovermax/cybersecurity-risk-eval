RISK FACTORS\nThe following section includes some of the material factors that may adversely affect our business and operations. This is not an exhaustive list, and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This discussion of risk factors includes many forward-looking statements. For cautions about relying on such forward looking statements, please refer to the section entitled \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Report immediately prior to Item 1.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of losses and have received a going concern opinion from our auditors.\nWe have experienced significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. In 2021, we incurred a net loss of approximately $19.5 million and had negative cash flows from operations of approximately $2.6 million. In 2020, we incurred a net loss of $13.8 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $9.8 million. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its audit reports an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We do not have sufficient cash resources from the net cash flows of operations from our current businesses to sustain our operations for the next twelve months and will rely on the continued sale of non-core assets, tax credits and related amounts, and raising capital through the sale of our securities.\nOur ability to protect our patents, service marks or other proprietary rights is uncertain, exposing us to possible losses of competitive advantage.\nOur efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not succeed in preventing infringement by others or ensure that these rights will provide us with a competitive advantage. Pending patent applications by us or any of our joint venturers may not result in issued patents and the validity of issued patents may be subject to challenge. Third parties may also be able to design around the patented aspects of the products. Additionally, certain of the issued patents and patent applications are owned jointly with third parties. Because any owner or co-owner of a patent can license its rights under jointly-owned patents or applications, inventions made by us jointly with others are not subject to our exclusive control. Any of these possible events could result in losses of competitive advantage.\nIntellectual property infringement claims against us could materially harm results of operations.\nOur products and products that we intend to provide such as robotic technologies, incorporate a number of technologies, including the technologies related to the Sapphire Cryocooler and the cryogenic air quality system. Our patent positions and that of our joint venturers are uncertain and there is significant risk that others, including our competitors or potential competitors, have obtained or will obtain patents relating to our products or technologies or products or technologies planned to be introduced by us.\nWe believe that patents may be or have been issued, or applications may be pending, claiming various compositions of matter used in our products and products that we intend to provide. We or our third party joint venturers may need to secure one or more licenses of these patents. There can be no assurances that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We or our third party joint venturers may be required to expend significant resources to develop alternatives that would not infringe such patents or to obtain licenses to the related technology. We or our third party joint venturers may not be able to successfully design around these patents or obtain licenses to them and may have to defend ourselves at substantial cost against allegations of infringement of third party patents or other rights to intellectual property. In those circumstances, we could face significant liabilities and also be forced to cease the use of key technology.\nOther parties may have the right to utilize technology important to our business.\nWe and our third party joint venturers utilize certain intellectual property rights under non-exclusive licenses or have granted to others the right to utilize certain intellectual property rights licensed from a third party. Because we and our third party joint venturers may not have the exclusive rights to utilize such intellectual property, other parties may be able to compete with us, which may harm our business.\nThe recent unprecedented events related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian War have caused significant market disruptions and may have longer-term effects that Clearday cannot predict.\nThe recent unprecedented events related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russo-Ukrainian War as well as global security issues generally have caused significant market disruptions and may have longer-term effects that Clearday cannot predict. The equity and other market professionals continue to assess the consequences of such events and the extent and effectiveness of government responses, the responses of the Federal Reserve Bank and other governmental and non-governmental organizations cannot be predicted.\nThe residents of Clearday\u2019s residential care communities and the clients of Clearday at Home and Clearday adult day care programs are primarily older individuals with pre-existing conditions, including conditions that significantly compromise their immunity. The additional procedures undertaken by our residential care and the adult day care businesses will likely result in reduced operating cash flow and profit margins. Although Clearday has procedures that address infectious diseases and contamination in a community environment, Clearday is not able to provide assurance that the communities will not be significant affected, including widespread contagion that could result in a suspension or closing of a facility. Additionally, state or federal regulatory authorities may require, and industry groups may provide, additional measures that could limit the number of individuals that may be treated at a facility, require additional staff or employees or other measures that may require significant investment or operating cost. The additional costs have primarily resulted from regulatory requirements to increase staff and provide quarantine areas. Additionally, during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, admissions to Clearday\u2019s residential care facilities were suspended and adult day care centers were closed.\nDuring such occasions, Clearday may experience a decline in clients. Further, depending on the severity of any occurrence, Clearday may be required to incur costs to identify, contain and remedy the impacts of those occurrences at our residential care communities or adult day care facilities. As a result, these occurrences could significantly adversely affect the results of operations.\nThe adult day care business has greater risks with respect to COVID-19 and other pandemics due to, among other reasons, that appropriate regulatory agencies may close such businesses, limit the capacity of such businesses, or require additional procedures or capital expenditures designed to protect customers that are costly. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many states closed adult day care centers for a period of time.\nThe Russo-Ukrainian War has caused, or has contributed to, significant inflation, increased energy costs and worsened the supply chain disruption in the U.S., each of which has contributed to increased costs for our operations which would worsen our operating results. We are not able to determine the extent or the expected period for such disruptions or if any other and similar disruptions would occur, or may have greater adverse effect on our business or the U.S. economy in general.\nThe additional procedures and precautions undertaken by adult day care businesses in response to COVID-19 will likely result in reduced operating cash flow and profit margins.\nAlthough Clearday has procedures that address infectious diseases and contamination in a community environment, Clearday is not able to provide assurance that the communities will not be significantly affected, including widespread contagion that could result in suspending or closing a facility. Depending on the severity of any occurrence, Clearday may be required to incur costs to identify, contain and remedy the impacts of those occurrences at residential care communities and our adult day care facilities.\nAdditionally, state or federal regulatory authorities may require, industry groups may provide or Clearday may otherwise determine that it would be prudent, to implement certain additional measures and/or quarantine procedures that may require significant investment and/or operating costs, such measures may include limiting the number of individuals that may be treated at a facility while requiring additional staff to manage treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, Clearday may also experience a decline in occupancy due to residents terminating their agreements due to the uncertainty of COVID-19 and its effects on adult day care businesses and residential care facilities. Such investments and increased costs may adversely affect Clearday\u2019s operations. The extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Clearday\u2019s overall business is uncertain, and our ability to raise capital could be impaired.\nAny other severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of Clearday\u2019s residential care communities and facilities.\nThe revenues of Clearday will be dependent in large part on the occupancy levels at our residential care communities and the members of the Clearday Clubs and any other adult day care facility or other non-acute care and wellness center that will be owned or operated by Clearday. Even if the disruption to the markets and facilities are not as pronounced as during the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be significant reduction in Clearday\u2019s revenues and there could be government or other regulatory intervention that materially increase costs, which would likely materially reduce the operating results of Clearday.\nClearday\u2019s non-acute care and wellness business has significant concentration in industry and geographic areas which exposes Clearday to changes in market conditions in this industry and in those areas.\nClearday\u2019s existing 4 residential care facilities are located in the Little Rock Arkansas area (1), Naples, Florida (1), and the San Antonio / Austin area of Texas (2) and we have 1 adult day care center in San Antonio, Texas. Clearday expects to grow our adult day care business primarily in specified markets in Texas. The Clearday at Home or digital service offerings of Clearday are national in scope, but are not, as of the date of this Report, significant compared to the residential care facility revenues. Accordingly, Clearday will continue to have a high concentration in select geographic markets. Additionally, all of Clearday\u2019s businesses, other than related to our remaining non-core assets, are engaged or will be engaged in the non-acute care businesses. As a result of this industry and geographic concentrations, the conditions affecting older Americans and the of local economies and real estate markets, changes in governmental rules and regulations, particularly with respect to senior citizens, acts of nature and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand for Clearday\u2019s services in these areas could have an adverse effect on Clearday\u2019s revenues, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, Clearday will be particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increases or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or tornadoes in those areas.\nCircumstances that adversely affect the ability of older adults or their families to pay Clearday for our adult day care services could cause our revenues and results of operations to decline.\nClearday expects that payment for our adult day care services will be (1) private pay and not rely on government benefits, such as Medicare and Medicaid, which are generally not available for such services, and (2) benefits or payments available to veterans through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Clearday has currently priced the basic service fee for our adult day care centers at a monthly amount that is generally expected to be less than the monthly payment benefits to retirees from the Social Security Administration and Clearday expects that older adults that live with family members will have sufficient funds to pay such service fees and their other household expenses. There can be no assurance that the expected service fee by Clearday will be at an amount that can be afforded by Clearday\u2019s target market for our Clearday Clubs. Economic downturns, higher levels of unemployment among family members, lower levels of consumer confidence, stock market volatility, increased inflation and/or changes in demographics, including the unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the ability of older adults to afford Clearday\u2019s expected adult day care service fees and could result in decreased fees and revenues resulting in a decline of Clearday\u2019s estimated operating results as many of the operating costs for an adult day care center will not vary in relation to a decrease in club members or revenues.\nClearday may not be able to operate our business or implement the business strategies.\nClearday intends to develop and expand new businesses including in the areas of home care services and products and provide services or otherwise have revenue from related services which may include retail sales of products including products that incorporate the technology of our Sapphire Cryocooler, robotics and provide other care services. Clearday created Clearday Labs to evaluate such opportunities and other strategies or business opportunities that Clearday believes would be complimentary to our existing businesses, specifically, our residential care facilities and the digital service offering, and where Clearday may benefit from certain synergies in management and leverage of assets. There can be no assurance, however, that Clearday will be able to implement our business strategy in a manner that realizes any of our intended benefits, including that Clearday will be able to acquire, internally develop or enter into strategic alliances for intended or prospective business lines.\nClearday\u2019s planned business and growth strategy may not yield anticipated returns, may result in disruptions to the business of, may strain management resources and/or may be dilutive to Clearday\u2019s stockholders.\nClearday\u2019s business and growth strategies involve the development (by organic growth or, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions and joint ventures) of businesses that are focused on tech-enabled non-acute care and wellness. In evaluating Clearday\u2019s business opportunities, Clearday will make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance and prospects. However, newly acquired businesses or investments in businesses, or strategic alliances, may fail to perform as expected, and Clearday may not be able to manage those businesses in a manner that meets our expectations. In particular, Clearday\u2019s acquisition activities may be subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf Clearday businesses that are acquired or conducted through joint ventures do not realize the synergies that it expects and require substantially greater investment than it anticipated;\n\u25cf Clearday may acquire or invest in businesses that realize net cash losses initially and/or for a period of time that is longer than Clearday anticipated;\n\u25cf If Clearday finances acquisitions or strategic alliances by incurring debt, Clearday\u2019s cash flow may be insufficient to meet the required principal and interest payments;\n\u25cf Clearday may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions or strategic alliances, and as a result Clearday\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected;\n\u25cf Operating expenses of an acquired business or a strategic alliance may exceed budgeted amounts;\n\u25cf Management may be diverted from operations; and\n\u25cf Clearday may be required to have management teams that are not proven or that do not, for any number of reasons, perform as expected.\nIf Clearday cannot operate our businesses or strategic alliances to meet our financial expectations, Clearday\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price our Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nClearday may use its securities and/or the securities our subsidiaries as consideration in connection with our acquisition strategy which could result in significant dilution to the relative ownership interest of holders of our capital stock prior to such acquisitions.\nIn addition, it is likely that Clearday will use its or a subsidiary\u2019s securities as consideration, in part or whole, for the purchase of acquired businesses as part of our asset and business acquisition strategy. Such securities may carry rights or preferences different from or superior to those of Clearday\u2019s common stock. Moreover, if such securities include Clearday\u2019s common stock or securities senior to or pari passu to or convertible or exchangeable into shares of Clearday\u2019s common stock, the relative ownership interest of the holders of the Clearday\u2019s capital stock would be subject to dilution.\nClearday\u2019s strategy includes businesses that are in development or early stages and such strategies and businesses include additional venture stage risks and there is no assurance that Clearday may be able to develop our businesses organically or through acquisitions.\nA fundamental strategy of Clearday is the continued development of our services, including Clearday at Home, Clearday Clubs, robotic applications as well as related businesses, including other products and services we expect to develop in our Clearday Labs. Clearday at Home does not have any material revenues as of the date of this Report. Clearday Clubs has opened its initial location by the acquisition of an adult day care center in San Antonio, Texas. Clearday\u2019s ability to successfully execute future development in accordance with our business plan, or at all, will be impacted by a number of factors, including the ability to sell our remaining non-core assets, the availability of additional financing, including additional equity financing, on terms acceptable to Clearday, the availability of government programs and reimbursements, market trends, the ability to identify and execute business opportunities, including acquisitions that meet the parameters of the Clearday business plan, and increased competition for sites for the expansion opportunities or acquisitions. The development and acquisitions of future businesses may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management. Failure to identify suitable development or acquisition businesses, effectively execute the Clearday business strategy or operating difficulties of businesses that Clearday may acquire in the future could have an adverse effect on Clearday\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nClearday will require additional capital and there is no assurance that any debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nTo the extent that Clearday develops its business through financing, including additional equity financing, there cannot be assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that Clearday may be able to satisfy the conditions precedent required to secure borrowings or utilize credit facilities, which could reduce the number, or alter the type, of investments that Clearday would make otherwise and the ability for it to expand its businesses. Any such limitation on such financing or sales of our remaining non-core assets may reduce income. To the extent that financing proves to be unavailable when needed, Clearday may also be compelled to modify our business strategy. Any failure to obtain financing or realize the sale of our remaining non-core assets or other assets may have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of Clearday\u2019s businesses. We do not have any binding agreement with an investment banker to provide additional capital. There is no assurance that the public market conditions, the market acceptance of Clearday, the price and volume of our common stock and other factors, will enable any such offering will be consummated on terms acceptable to Clearday or that AGP or any other investment bank will then decide that it would then manage or participate in any such offering.\nIf Clearday fails to identify and quickly respond to changes and trends in non-acute care and wellness preferences, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely impacted.\nClearday expects to provide services to the non-acute care and wellness industry and expects the products and services to be subject to dynamic changes. The needs and preferences of older adults have generally changed over the past several years, including preferences to reside in their homes longer or permanently, as well as changes in services and offerings, including delivery of home healthcare services, utilization of outpatient rehabilitation services and services that address their increasing desire to maintain active lifestyles. If Clearday fails to identify such changes and quickly and successfully respond to such changes to deliver accepted products and services, then competitors will be able to successfully penetrate the markets that Clearday will operate and Clearday will not be able to successfully grow or maintain our businesses, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur debt leverage and financing arrangements that we may enter into may, under certain circumstances, contain restrictions and limitations that could impact our ability to operate our business.\nClearday has incurred its long term and other debt, primarily, in connection with the financing of (1) long term assets that are now held for sale, and (2) the financing of the residential care facility in Naples, Florida and its operations and (3) other loans that have funded our operations. The indebtedness of Clearday may have the effect, among other things, of reducing the flexibility of Clearday to respond to changing business and economic conditions, requiring us to use increased amounts of cash flow to service indebtedness and increasing our borrowing costs.\nOur remaining non-core assets that are held for disposition are treated differently under GAAP.\nA material amount of the assets on the Clearday balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, are held for disposition. These assets are treated differently under GAAP than the assets that are used in Clearday\u2019s operating non-acute care and wellness business. These differences are described in greater detail in the footnotes to the financial statements that are included in this Report and the, including that these assets are not subject to depreciation and such assets have not been subject to depreciation expense with respect to these assets from and after December 31, 2018.\nThe remaining non-core assets may not have the net realizable value that is estimated.\nClearday intends to finance, in part, our development and expansion of our tech-enabled non-acute care businesses by the sale of our remaining non-core assets. A significant amount of our non-core assets of Clearday have been sold and the net proceeds have been used in Clearday\u2019s operations and business development. Clearday is not expected to make additional investments in any of these remaining assets to be able to reposition the asset to achieve their highest or best use or otherwise achieve a better value. Further, certain of our remaining non-core assets may require additional investment to maintain, such as replacement or repairs, and deferring maintenance and other related costs could decrease the net realizable value of our remaining non-core assets. There can be no assurance that the value of our remaining non-core assets will be able to be sold for the net realizable value that is estimated or the amount that such assets are on the financial statements of Clearday.\nOperators of senior care facilities must comply with the rules and regulations of governmental reimbursement programs and certification requirements, fraud and abuse regulations and are subject to new legislative developments.\nOur care businesses are highly regulated by federal, state and local licensing requirements, facility inspections, reimbursement policies, regulations concerning capital and other expenditures, certification requirements and other laws, regulations and rules. Any failure to comply with such laws, requirements and regulations could affect Clearday\u2019s ability to operate the facilities that Clearday owns or operates. Healthcare operators are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers. These laws prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, a particular provider for medical products and services. They also require compliance with a variety of safety, health, staffing and other requirements relating to the design and conditions of the licensed facility and quality of care provided.\nThese regulations may also enable the regulatory agency to place liens on properties. Possible sanctions for violation of these laws and regulations include loss of licensure or certification, the imposition of civil monetary and criminal penalties, and potential exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Failure of Clearday to comply with these rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, this area of the law currently is subject to intense scrutiny. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted that could require changes in the design of the properties and its joint venture\u2019s operations and thus increase the costs of these operations.\nPrivate third-party payers continue to try to reduce healthcare costs.\nPrivate third-party payers such as insurance companies continue their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased utilization review practices and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. These third-party payers increasingly demand discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. These efforts of third-party payers to limit the amount of payments that Clearday or others may receive for healthcare services could adversely affect Clearday and would adversely affect Clearday even if such insurance policies do not cover residential or non-residential care facilities that Clearday will operate as the total household cash flow would be reduced and there would be less funds available for Clearday\u2019s services. At the same time, as a result of competitive pressures, Clearday\u2019s ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private pay options may be limited.\nHealthcare policy changes, including proposals to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may harm the Clearday\u2019s future business.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. There have been and continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to keep these costs down. Clearday is unable to assess with certainty the extent of governmental requirements and regulations that will apply to Clearday\u2019s care and wellness businesses. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - Residential Care and Adult Day Care Businesses.\u201d The regulations that affect our operations are subject to changes. In addition, these regulations and other ongoing initiatives in the United States have increased and will continue to increase pressure on pricing and operations of residential and non-residential care facilities. The announcement or adoption of any government initiatives could have an adverse effect on potential revenues from any product that Clearday may successfully develop. Moreover, additional legislative or regulatory changes remain possible and appear likely. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. Clearday cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on Clearday. However, an expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower the revenues for future products and adversely affect Clearday\u2019s future business, possibly materially.\nClearday is unable to determine the effect of the amount of wage increases that are expected with labor shortages and any regulatory changes effected by the administration of President Biden, including regulations regarding minimum wages and benefits.\nThe care industry, and businesses in general, have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant labor shortages, particularly for care givers. Clearday will continue to compete with other residential care community and day care operators, among others, to attract and retain qualified personnel responsible for the day to day operations of Clearday\u2019s current and planned care and wellness businesses. The market for qualified staff, including professional staff such as nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals, is highly competitive, and periodic or geographic area shortages of such healthcare professionals may require us to increase the wages and benefits that we offer to our employees in order to attract and retain such personnel or to utilize temporary personnel at an increased cost. Additionally, any shortages of staff may require us to retain per diem employees and incur overtime, each of which would increase our wage and benefit expenses. In addition, employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs, have materially increased in recent years and Clearday cannot predict the future impact of the Healthcare Reform Act, or any other future healthcare legislation, on the cost of employee health insurance. Increasing employee health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs may materially and adversely affect our earnings. From time to time labor unions may attempt to organize Clearday\u2019s employees. If Clearday\u2019s employees were to unionize, it could result in business interruptions, work stoppages, the degradation of service levels due to work rules, or increased operating expenses that may adversely affect our results of operations. One of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant shortage of employees for many industries, including our residential care industry. Additionally, many states have increased the minimum hourly wage for employees, including Florida and Arkansas. The labor shortage has increased wage pressure and is likely to increase our wage and benefit expense.\nClearday cannot be sure that labor costs will not increase or that any increases will be recovered by corresponding increases in the rates that Clearday will charge to our clients or otherwise. Any significant failure by us to control labor costs or to pass any increases on to clients through rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, increased costs charged to Clearday\u2019s clients may reduce Clearday\u2019s occupancy and growth and related revenues.\nAdditionally, healthcare and elder care are important political issues. President Biden has used, and may continue to use, executive orders to achieve policy goals and objectives. In addition, such policy goals and objectives may be realized through legislation that is sponsored or otherwise supported by President Biden\u2019s administration. Clearday is unable to assess the consequences to improvements to the healthcare systems and that may be realized by such actions, including any effect of increased costs or taxes.\nThe planned adult daycare business may require Clearday to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve care centers.\nClearday\u2019s planned adult day care and clinics and related facilities may require from time to time significant expenditures to address required ongoing maintenance or to make them more attractive to Clearday\u2019s clients. Physical characteristics of facilities are mandated by various government authorities; changes in these regulations may require Clearday to make significant expenditures. Supply chain issues and building material shortages have increased, and may continue to increase, construction costs, including the costs for expected leasehold improvements. In addition, Clearday may often be required to make significant capital expenditures when Clearday acquires, leases or manages new facilities. Clearday\u2019s available financial resources may be insufficient to fund these expenditures. Clearday may be unable to pay increased rent at any facility without experiencing losses.\nBecause the merger resulted in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code Clearday, Clearday\u2019s pre-merger NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to limitations.\nWe underwent an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d), the corporation\u2019s NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising before the ownership change are subject to limitations on use after the ownership change. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders that exceeds fifty percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be subject to limitations (or disallowance) on their use. The Section 382 limitation will cause a significant portion of Clearday\u2019s pre-AIU Merger net operating loss carryforwards to never be utilized. In addition, if Clearday is determined to have discontinued its historic pre-merger business following the merger, subject to certain exceptions, the Section 382 limitation could eliminate all possibility of utilizing Clearday\u2019s pre-merger NOL carryforwards. Additional ownership changes in the future could result in additional limitations on Clearday\u2019s NOL carryforwards. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations.\nClearday has a limited history of operations, and our Clearday at Home and Clearday Care adult day care and robotic businesses are each an emerging business that will expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with operating and growing an emerging business within an emerging industry.\nEach of the innovative care solutions and the adult day care and robotic businesses to be conducted by us is significant to our growth opportunities and plans. These businesses include the virtual day care business and the adult day care services through physical locations and the sale of robots. Clearday does not have any material operational history in such businesses by which potential investors can evaluate our past performance and likelihood of success. As of the date of this Report, we have only one adult day care business do not have any centers that use our proprietary Clearday Clubs format or any revenue from our robotic business. The financial position and results of operations of Clearday, including our most recent financial statements included in this Report, are not indicative of the tech-enabled non-acute care businesses that we intend to pursue. Such Clearday businesses do not have any earnings history for investors to estimate our future level of sales or profitability or whether Clearday will in fact have sales or profitability. As a result of such industry and geographic focus, the conditions affecting older Americans as well as the local economies and real estate markets in such geographic areas and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand for our services in these areas could have an adverse effect on Clearday\u2019s revenues, results of operations and cash flow. A core component of our strategy is the development and expansion of our tech-enabled non-acute care businesses. Our ability to successfully execute future development in accordance with our business plan, or at all, will be impacted by a number of factors, including the ability to sell our remaining non-core assets, the availability of financing on terms acceptable to us, market trends, the ability to identify and execute business opportunities (including acquisitions that meet the parameters of the Clearday business plan), and increased competition for sites for the expansion opportunities or acquisitions. Any such limitation on any such financing or sale of the remaining non-core assets may reduce income.\nIf Clearday fails to identify such changes and quickly and successfully respond to such changes to deliver accepted products and services, then competitors will be able to successfully penetrate the markets in which Clearday operates which may limit Clearday\u2019s ability to successfully grow and/or maintain our businesses, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nClearday incurred substantial expenses related to the completion of the AIU Merger.\nClearday incurred substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the September 9, 2021 AIU Merger. The substantial majority of these costs were non-recurring expenses, including a substantial fee payable to AGP and legal and other professional fees and expenses and insurance expenses, and the fees related to the registration and issuance of the common stock issued in connection with such AIU Merger. Clearday does not have excess cash flows from its existing businesses to fund the payment of such additional expenses and will require revenues from its innovative businesses or the ability to raise capital through the sale of securities. There can be no assurance that we are able to raise additional funds through the sale of its securities on terms that are acceptable or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is expected to be, subject to significant volatility. The value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects. Factors affecting our market price include:\n\u25cf liquidity and volume in the trading of our common stock;\n\u25cf market perception as to our ability to develop and launch our innovative care products and services;\n\u25cf our perceived prospects and liquidity, including our ability to sell non-core assets;\n\u25cf our perceived ability to sell products and services directly to the residents in our residential care facilities and otherwise expand our revenues from current fees from our residential care business;\n\u25cf variations in our operating results and whether we have achieved key business targets;\n\u25cf changes in, or our failure to meet, earnings estimates;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 buy/sell recommendations;\n\u25cf differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts;\n\u25cf announcements of new contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf market reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf general economic, political or stock market conditions; and\n\u25cf the impact of inflation on our operations, including our ability to control costs, including labor, food, and energy expenses.\nRecent events have caused stock prices for many companies, including ours, to fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. The general economic, political and stock market conditions that may affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control. The market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options and convertible securities, and future sales of the shares obtained upon exercise of these options, warrants and convertible securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 0 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of 0 per share and warrants to purchase up to 4,038,801 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $8.90 per share and securities that have been issued by our subsidiaries with an accrued amount equal to $897,000 which may be exchanged for shares of our common stock at a price that is equal to the volume weighted average price of our common stock for 20 days prior to the date of such exchange. The holders may sell these shares in the public markets from time to time under a registration statement or under Rule 144, without limitations on the timing, amount or method of sale. The shares of common stock that would be issued upon the exercise or exchange of our options for 89,700 shares of our common stock or the securities that were issued by our subsidiaries have been registered under the AIU Merger Registration Statement. The holders of such convertible or exchangeable for our shares of common stock, may exercise such rights sell a large number of shares of our comment stock, which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur corporate governance structure may prevent our acquisition by another company at a premium over the public trading price of our shares.\nIt is possible that the acquisition of a majority of our outstanding voting stock by another company could result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the public trading price for our shares. Provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, each as amended, and of Delaware corporate law could delay or make more difficult an acquisition of our company by merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even if it would create an immediate benefit to our stockholders. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation does not permit stockholders to act by written consent, and our bylaws generally require ninety days advance notice of any matters to be brought before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting.\nIn addition, our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms, rights and preferences of this preferred stock, including voting rights of those shares, without any further vote or action by the stockholders and while we are not listed on an exchange such as the NYSE American, we can issue a significant number of voting shares and voting power without stockholder approval. At December 31, 2021, approximately 4,293,170 shares of such \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock remained unissued. The rights of the holders of common stock may be subordinate to, and adversely affected by, the rights of holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, even at a premium over our public trading price.\nFurthermore, our certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors with directors divided into three classes serving staggered terms. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us without action by our stockholders and, therefore, could adversely affect the price of our stock or the possibility of sale of shares to an acquiring person.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe price of Clearday\u2019s common stock may decrease.\nThe market price of the Clearday\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of a number of reasons, including if:\n\u25cf the planned development and expansion by Clearday of the adult day care business or digital services or other innovative products and services is delayed or not successful; or\n\u25cf Clearday\u2019s business and prospects are not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nOur ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain, exposing us to possible losses of competitive advantage.\nOur efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not succeed in preventing infringement by others or ensure that these rights will provide us with a competitive advantage. Pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and the validity of issued patents may be subject to challenge. Third parties may also be able to design around the patented aspects of the products or design around our copyrights, including the coding for our digital services. Additionally, certain of the issued patents and patent applications are owned jointly with third parties. Because any owner or co-owner of a patent can license its rights under jointly-owned patents or applications, inventions made by us jointly with others are not subject to our exclusive control. Any of these possible events could result in losses of competitive advantage.\nWe depend on specific patents and licenses to technologies, and it will likely need additional technologies in the future that it may not be able to obtain.\nWe utilize technologies under licenses of patents from others for certain of our products. These patents may be subject to challenge, which may result in significant litigation expense (which may or may not be recoverable against future royalty obligations). Additionally, we may be required to utilize intellectual property rights owned by others, including patents developed by a third-party engineering firm for the cryogenic air quality system, and may seek licenses to do so. Such licenses may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. It is also possible that Clearday may inadvertently utilize intellectual property rights held by others, which could result in substantial claims.\nOther parties may have the right to utilize technology important to our business.\nWe utilize certain intellectual property rights under non-exclusive licenses or have granted to others the right to utilize certain intellectual property rights licensed from a third party. Because we may not have the exclusive rights to utilize such intellectual property, other parties may be able to compete with us, which may harm our business.\nWe will face significant competition.\nWe will compete with numerous care and wellness companies, including developers, owners and operators of residential and non-residential facilities, many of which own or operate facilities that are similar to Clearday\u2019s current and planned facilities in the same markets in which we are, or will be located. Clearday competes with numerous other managers and operators of care and wellness businesses that are focused on the non-acute care market, including adult day care centers and products that compete with products that will be distributed by Clearday. Some of Clearday\u2019s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us and some of our competitors are not for profit entities which have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures as us. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of clients or residents at rates that will generate acceptable returns or that we will be able to attract employees and keep wages and other employee benefits, insurance costs and other operating expenses at levels which will allow us to compete successfully and operate profitably.\nClearday\u2019s competition may also be from senior housing, senior healthcare, home healthcare, medical and healthcare providers that expand their services or otherwise provide comparable services or utilize tech-enabled products and services that Clearday will utilize. Any such companies or combination of companies may have referral or strategic relationships that reduce the number of consumers that would otherwise use Clearday\u2019s products or services. In recent years, a significant number of new senior age communities and services have been developed and continue to be developed. Accordingly, Clearday expects to have increased competitive pressures, particularly in certain geographic markets where Clearday\u2019s intends to operate our care services. These competitive challenges may prevent Clearday from establishing, maintaining or improving revenues, which may adversely affect Clearday.\nFederal, state and local employment related laws and regulations could increase Clearday\u2019s cost of doing business, and Clearday may fail to comply with such laws and regulations.\nClearday\u2019s operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local employment related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs matters such as minimum wages, the Family and Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, and a variety of similar laws that govern these and other employment related matters. Because labor represents (and will represent) a significant portion of Clearday\u2019s ordinary operating expenses from its care and wellness businesses, compliance with these evolving laws and regulations could substantially increase Clearday\u2019s cost of doing business, while failure to do so could subject Clearday to significant back pay awards, fines and lawsuits. Clearday\u2019s failures to comply with federal, state and local employment related laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe US federal minimum wage increases in five steps over five years ending with a $15 minimum wage in 2025, with automatically increase in line with changes in the median hourly wage in the economy. Certain states have increased the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Additionally, we have received benefits of the Employee Retention Credits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) which have ended during 2021 This and other labor related actions have increased the cost of our operating expenses. The extent of such actions cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nClearday may fail to comply with laws governing the privacy and security of personal information, including relating to health information.\nClearday will be required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information and protected health information. State laws also govern protected health information, and rules regarding state privacy rights. Other federal and state laws govern the privacy of other personally identifiable information. If Clearday fails to comply with applicable federal or state standards, then we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect Clearday\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClearday will continue to incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nClearday will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. Clearday will also incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and any exchange that Clearday may have its common stock listed. These rules and regulations are expected to increase the Clearday\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. The executive officers of Clearday will continue to need to devote substantial time to gaining expertise regarding operations as a public company and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These rules and regulations also have made it expensive for Clearday to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for Clearday to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence in Clearday and could cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nClearday may become subject to litigation, which could have an adverse effect on its performance.\nClearday may from time to time become subject to litigation, including claims relating to our residential care and other operations. Clearday\u2019s planned businesses include the continuation of our residential care facilities, adult day care and our planned in-home care which are businesses that are regulated and have a high risk for plaintiff actions. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. Clearday generally intends to vigorously defend itself; however, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters against the us may result in Clearday having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments, and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact Clearday\u2019s earnings and cash flows, thereby having an adverse effect on Clearday\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and/or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors.\nClearday depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.\nClearday\u2019s ability to manage its businesses and anticipated future growth depends, in large part, upon the efforts of key personnel, particularly James Walesa, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and B.J. Parrish, our director and Chief Operating Officer. Such key personnel have extensive knowledge and relationships and exercise substantial influence over Clearday\u2019s operational, financing, acquisition and disposition activity. There is significant competition in the care and wellness industry for experienced personnel and there is a risk that Clearday may not be able to continue to retain our key personnel. The loss of services of one or more members of Clearday\u2019s executive management team, or Clearday\u2019s inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, could adversely affect Clearday\u2019s business, diminish Clearday\u2019s investment opportunities and weaken Clearday\u2019s relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants and industry personnel, which could adversely affect us.\nClearday relies on information technology and systems in its operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology or those systems could materially and adversely affect us.\nClearday will continue to rely on information technology and systems, including the internet and commercially available software, to process, transmit, store and safeguard information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personally identifiable information of employees, residents and clients. If Clearday experiences security breaches or other similar failures, or other inadequacies or interruptions of our information technology, we could incur material costs and losses and our operations could be disrupted as a result. Further, third-party vendors could experience similar events with respect to their information technology and systems that impact the products and services they provide to us. We will continue to rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring, as well as our internal procedures and personnel, to provide security for processing, transmitting, storing and safeguarding confidential resident, customer and vendor information, such as personally identifiable information related to our employees and others, including our residents and clients, and information regarding their and Clearday\u2019s financial accounts. We will continue to take various actions, and may incur significant costs, to maintain and protect the operation and security of our information technology and systems, including the data maintained in those systems. However, it is possible that these measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or a compromise in security, such as in the event of a cyberattack or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, online fraud schemes and similar breaches can create significant system disruptions, shutdowns, fraudulent transfer of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The cybersecurity risks to Clearday and our third party vendors are heightened by, among other things, the evolving nature of the threats faced, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and new and increasingly sophisticated methods used to perpetuate illegal or fraudulent activities against Clearday, including cyberattacks, email or wire fraud and other attacks exploiting security vulnerabilities in Clearday\u2019s or third parties\u2019 information technology networks and systems or operations. Any failure to maintain the security, proper function and availability of Clearday\u2019s information technology and systems, or certain third party vendors\u2019 failure to similarly protect their information technology and systems that are relevant to the Clearday or our operations, or to safeguard Clearday\u2019s business processes, assets and information could result in financial losses, interrupt Clearday\u2019s operations, damage our reputation, cause us to be in default of material contracts and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties. Any or all of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nChanges in tax laws or other actions could have a negative effect on us.\nAt any time, the federal or state income tax laws, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended. Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and state taxing authorities. Changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. The administration of President Biden has recently proposed changes to the Internal Revenue Code that, if enacted, could have adverse tax consequences for us. Such proposals are subject to significant changes. There cannot be any assurances as to any changes in the Internal Revenue Code that may be implemented, including any that may be adverse to us.\nClearday\u2019s insurance may not cover potential losses, including from adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other events.\nWe carry commercial property, liability and other insurance coverage on our businesses. We select policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We do not expect to carry insurance for losses such as loss from riots or war because such coverage is not available or is not available at commercially reasonable rates. Some of our policies, including those covering losses due to terrorism and certain other insurance policies, are subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses, which could adversely affect our operations. We may discontinue terrorism or other insurance if the cost of premiums for any such policies exceeds, in our judgment, the expected benefit from carrying the policies. If following the termination or failure to renew any insurance policy we experience an adverse uninsured event, we may be required to incur significant costs, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. Additionally, insurance to cover the risk of business interruptions may not be available or available at commercially reasonable rates and may not cover the specific events that require a closure of interrupt of any of our businesses.\nIf we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the assets and businesses that that was made. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable costs in the future as the costs associated with property and casualty renewals may be higher than anticipated.\nClearday\u2019s operations will be subject to risks from adverse weather and climate events.\nSevere weather may have an adverse effect on certain residential care or adult day care facilities to be operated by us and by our remaining non-core assets. Flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe weather events, including hurricanes, tornadoes and widespread fires have had and may have in the future an adverse effect on such assets and facilities and result in significant losses to us and interruption of our business. We may incur significant costs and losses as a result of these activities, both in terms of operating, preparing and repairing our residential care communities or adult day care centers or the properties owned by use in anticipation of, during and after a severe weather or climate-related event and in terms of potential lost business due to the interruption in operations that may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nTerrorist attacks or riots in any locations in which Clearday acquires properties could significantly impact the demand for, and value of, Clearday\u2019s properties.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of terrorism or war or riots would severely impact the demand for, and value of, Clearday\u2019s planned businesses. Terrorist attacks in any of the metropolitan areas in which the Clearday expects to have operations also could directly impact the value of Clearday through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs, and could thereafter materially impact the availability or cost of insurance to protect against such acts. A decrease in demand could make it difficult to maintain the expansion of the adult day care business in accordance with the business plan. To the extent that any future terrorist attack otherwise disrupts Clearday\u2019s planned businesses, it may impair the ability to make timely payments to fund operations, which would harm the operating results and could materially and adversely affect us.\nCurrent government policies regarding interest rates and trade policies may cause a recession.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve policy regarding the timing and amount of future increases in interest rates and changing U.S. and other countries\u2019 trade policies may hinder the growth of the U.S. economy. It is unclear whether the U.S. economy will be able to withstand these challenges and continue sustained growth. Economic weakness in the U.S. economy generally or a new U.S. recession would likely adversely affect Clearday\u2019s financial condition, including by limiting Clearday\u2019s ability to pay rent or other obligations and causing the value of Clearday\u2019s owned and operated residential care communities, and remaining non-core assets and of our securities to decline. Further, general economic conditions, such as inflation, commodity costs, fuel and other energy costs, costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, interest rates, and tax rates, affect our operating and general and administrative expenses, and we have no control or limited ability to control such factors. Such economic uncertainties and conditions may adversely affect us and others, including our landlords, and our clients, such as by reducing access to funding or credit, increasing the cost of credit, limiting the ability to manage interest rate risk and increasing the risk that obligations will not be fulfilled, as well as other impacts which Clearday is unable to fully anticipate.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d Clearday may avail itself of reduced disclosure requirements, which may make Clearday\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nClearday is a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d Clearday may rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies, such as simplified executive compensation disclosures and reduced financial statement disclosure requirements in our SEC filings. Clearday may continue to rely on such exemptions for so long as it remains a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d. These exemptions include reduced financial disclosure, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nDecreased disclosures in Clearday\u2019s SEC filings due to its status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. Clearday cannot predict if investors will find the Clearday\u2019s common stock less attractive if it relies on these exemptions. If some investors find Clearday\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Clearday\u2019s common stock and Clearday\u2019s stock price may be more volatile. Clearday may take advantage of the reporting exemptions applicable to a smaller reporting company until it is no longer a smaller reporting company, which status would end once it has a public float greater than $250 million. In that event, Clearday could still be a smaller reporting company if its annual revenues were below $100 million, and it has a public float of less than $700 million. Clearday\u2019s reliance on these exemptions may result in the public finding that Clearday\u2019s common stock to be less attractive and adversely impact the market price of Clearday\u2019s common stock or the trading market thereof.\nWe are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions, and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.\nThe Commission has adopted regulations which generally define so-called \u201cpenny stocks\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. Our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d, and we are subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule affects the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and affects the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\nThere can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the Commission the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the Commission finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted similar rules that may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock. FINRA rules require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for such customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nThe \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules make it more difficult for a stockholder to deposit our common stock with a broker dealer and to purchase or sell our common stock, which reduces the volume of transactions and increases the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nClearday expects to not pay cash dividends on its common stock and investors may have to sell their shares in order to realize value for their investment.\nClearday has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Clearday intends to use its cash for reinvestment in the development and expansion of the care and wellness businesses and to pay its debt and lease obligations. As a result, investors may have to sell their shares of common stock to realize any of their investment.\nClearday\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective which could have a significant and adverse effect on Clearday\u2019s business and reputation.\nClearday is subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder (\u201cSection 404\u201d). Section 404 requires Clearday to report on the design and effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nSome, but not all, of Clearday\u2019s officers and directors have experience as officers or directors of a public company. Clearday\u2019s internal controls have certain material weaknesses, including insufficient segregation of duties. Clearday has instituted efforts to remediate these concerns and enhance Clearday\u2019s internal control environment to remediate these issues by the end of 2021. However, any failure to maintain effective controls could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and cause Clearday to fail to meet its periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in Clearday\u2019s financial statements. Clearday may also be required to incur costs to improve its internal control system and hire additional personnel. This could negatively impact the Clearday\u2019s results of operations.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and divert management\u2019s attention from operating Clearday\u2019s business, which could have a material adverse effect on Clearday\u2019s business.\nThere have been other changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in addition to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as new regulations promulgated by the SEC and rules promulgated by national securities exchanges. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, Clearday\u2019s efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Clearday\u2019s board members, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, Clearday may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could have a material adverse effect on Clearday\u2019s business. If Clearday\u2019s efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, Clearday may incur additional expenses to comply with standards set by regulatory authorities or governing bodies which would have a material adverse effect on Clearday\u2019s business and results of operations.\nDelaware law could discourage a change in control, or an acquisition of Clearday by a third party, even if the acquisition would be favorable to stockholders.\nThe DGCL contains provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of Clearday, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders. Delaware law imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d. These provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in Clearday\u2019s control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of common stock over then current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nClearday\u2019s board has the authority to issue \u201cBlank Check\u201d Preferred Stock, which could affect the rights of holders of the Clearday\u2019s common stock and may delay or prevent a takeover that could be in the best interests of Clearday\u2019s stockholders.\nThe board of Clearday has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock (the \u201cSeries Preferred Stock\u201d), in one or more series and to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, the voting powers, designation, preferences and relative participation, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including the dividend rights and dividend rate, terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption price or prices, conversion rights and liquidation preferences of the shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Similarly, the Clearday board may authorize a subsidiary of Clearday to issue securities that may have any such rights, powers or preferences. The issuance of any such securities could affect the rights of the holders of Clearday\u2019s common stock. For example, such issuance could result in a class of securities outstanding that would have preferential voting, dividend, and liquidation rights over Clearday\u2019s common stock, and could (upon conversion or otherwise) enjoy all of the rights appurtenant to the shares of our common stock.
