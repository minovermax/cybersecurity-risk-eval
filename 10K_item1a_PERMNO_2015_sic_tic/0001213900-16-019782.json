{"cik": "1097792", "company": "Ominto, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur operating prospects have recently been in doubt\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors and Executive Management reasonably believes that the Company will continue to exist to carry out all objectives, commitments, and stated goals for the immediate future. Profitability and positive cash flows from operations continue to improve. The Company is currently able to meet all current and immediate obligations without substantial asset sales or restructuring. Management believes the Company\u2019s financial trends will continue to be positive as a result of a new Cash Back shopping platform, changes to the Company\u2019s business model and the arrival of new management team members. Furthermore, there are no known loan defaults, denial of trade credit from suppliers, and no known adverse legal proceedings that could materially affect the Company.\nWe are continuing to advance our growth strategies by expanding our network; adding on-line and other digital capabilities to attract new consumers; acquiring business customers and expanding geographies in our business. To better position us for sustainable growth of the business, we are implementing a series of strategic actions, with a focus on enhancing our value proposition, continuing to invest in the fast-growing digital channels, and further optimizing our cost structure.\nWe have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we do not improve our internal controls and systems, our business may suffer and the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment may be harmed. Any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital.\nConsistent with the Sarbanes Oxley framework, we are engaged in the process of completing and documenting each of the Company\u2019s key information technology and business processes necessary to improve our internal controls. Our first step was to assess our significant processes. We have undertaken this assessment and have made an initial determination of our significant processes. We are currently engaged in the next step in this process which is to document these significant processes and design key controls for each process.\nWe continue to take remedial measures to correct our internal control deficiencies and expect to devote significant resources to improving our internal controls. We have added four (4) full time positions in our accounting department which we believe will continue to improve internal controls. With the additional staff, we will be able to focus on providing additional training, as well as provide adequate time for our staff to complete the control procedures which have been or will be assigned to them.\nWe cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls will be adequate in the future or that the controls will be effective in preventing fraud or material misstatement. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, and fraud may be easier to perpetrate on us. Any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could, in turn, affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective. Additionally, inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial statements and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nCompliance with corporate governance and public disclosure regulations may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and new regulations issued by the SEC are creating additional disclosure obligations. We may need to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment would result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nThere are significant market risks associated with our business.\nWe have formulated our business plan and strategies based on certain assumptions regarding the size and dynamics of the e-commerce marketplace, our anticipated share of this market, the estimated price and acceptance of our services and products and other factors. These assumptions are based on our best estimates, however, our assessments may not prove to be correct. Our future success may depend upon factors including, among other things, effectiveness of our marketing efforts, effectiveness of our Partner Programs, increased levels of competition, including the entry of additional competitors and increased success by existing competitors, changes in general economic conditions, increases in operating costs and reduced margins caused by competitive pressures.\nThe direct customer Cash Back market in which we participate is extremely competitive.\nThe market for online Cash Back solutions is highly competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing. Consumers seeking to save money on online purchases use search engines, social networks, comparison shopping websites, and loyalty sites. We believe that our most significant competitors offering Cash Back to consumers are Ebates\u00ae, Shopathome\u2122 and Fat Wallet\u00ae (which is owned by Ebates\u00ae). Others competitors in the e-commerce marketplace focus primarily on excess and overstock products with fixed price formats. We expect competitors to launch new and innovative models and strategies. With the introduction of new technologies and the influx of new entrants to the market, we expect competition to intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase customers shopping at our portals and obtain profitability. There are very limited barriers to entry for competitors.\nOur success depends on the breadth, depth, quality and reliability of our Cash Back offerings, as well as our continued innovation and ability to provide features that make our shopping websites useful and appealing to customers. If we are unable to develop quality features that Partners and consumers want, then our Partners and shoppers are likely to try one of our competitors. Our current and potential competitors may have significantly more brand awareness, financial resources, customer support, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, have more extensive consumer bases and deeper relationships, and may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may be better able to respond quickly to new technologies, develop deeper merchant relationships or offer higher cash back. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to recruit Partners and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, or increased sales and marketing expenses.\nWe also directly and indirectly compete with online retailers for consumer traffic directly to their websites. Many online retailers market their own websites to consumers using their own websites, e-mail newsletters and alerts, mobile applications, social media presence and other distribution channels. Our online retailers could be more successful than we are at marketing their own websites or could decide to terminate their relationship with us because they no longer want to pay us a share of purchases on their own sites. We may face competition from companies we do not yet know about. If existing or new companies develop, market or resell competitive Cash Back solutions, acquire one of our existing competitors or form a strategic alliance with one of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our ability to develop profitable operations could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to expand the capabilities of our digital Cash Back solutions for our mobile platforms, our revenues may decrease and we could lose our customers to our competitors who have more robust mobile platforms.\nWeb usage and the consumption of digital content are increasingly shifting to mobile platforms such as smart phones and other connected devices. Industry-wide solutions to monetize online referral sites effectively on these platforms are at an early stage of development and the future demand and growth prospects for online shopping portals on these mobile platforms is uncertain. The growth of our business depends in part on our ability to deliver compelling solutions to consumers through these new mobile marketing channels. We expect to launch our customized mobile app on our Ominto.com site during fiscal 2017. We cannot be sure that our introduction of this platform will be timely or successful. Our success on mobile platforms and ability to deliver high quality mobile offerings will be dependent on our compatibility with popular mobile operating systems, such as Android, iOS and Windows Mobile. Compatibility changes in such systems that degrade our functionality or improve the functionality of our competitors\u2019 services could adversely affect usage of our services through mobile devices. We may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards. If we fail to achieve success with our mobile applications (\u201cmobile apps\u201d) and mobile website, or if we otherwise fail to deliver effective solutions to advertisers for mobile platforms and other emerging platforms, our ability to monetize these growth opportunities will be constrained, and financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe face more risks with our international operations.\nOur international expansion has been rapid and our international business is critical to our reaching profitability. We intend to continue to expand our white label Partner programs in new countries in parallel with our DubLi Network expansion which will offer co-branded Partner sites. This continued expansion into new international markets requires us to localize our services to conform to local laws, cultures, standards, and policies. Weaknesses in the commercial, Internet, and transportation infrastructure in developing countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our business model. In many countries, we compete with local companies that understand the local market better than we do, and we may not benefit from first-to-market advantages. We may not be successful in expanding into new international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations.\nWe are subject to the following risks of doing business internationally, which include:\n\u25cf regulatory requirements including regulation of Internet services, communications, professional selling, distance selling, privacy and data protection, banking and money transmitting, that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in some jurisdictions, prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers, prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods, require product changes, require special licensure, subject us to various taxes, penalties or audits, or limit the transfer of information between us and our Business Associates, Partners, customers and participating merchants on our shopping portals;\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating with local payment providers, including banks, credit and debit card networks, and electronic fund transfer systems or with the local telecommunications infrastructure;\n\u25cf differing levels of retail distribution, shipping, communications, and Internet infrastructures;\n\u25cf difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences, including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites;\n\u25cf higher telecommunications and Internet service-provider costs;\n\u25cf different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws;\n\u25cf expenses associated with localizing our products, including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency;\n\u25cf profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions, and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf volatility in a country or region\u2019s political, economic or military conditions;\n\u25cf challenges associated with maintaining relationships with local law enforcement and related agencies;\n\u25cf interrupted or prohibited operations in jurisdictions where a potential violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could occur;\n\u25cf the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems and\n\u25cf varied intellectual property laws.\nOur international costs of doing business may exceed our comparable domestic costs. As we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we face challenges in repatriating money without adverse tax consequences, and risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe conduct certain product and website development, customer support and other operations, in regions outside the US. We are subject to both US and local laws and regulations applicable to our offshore activities. If we fail to obtain anticipated benefits associated with providing these functions outside of the US, including cost efficiencies and productivity improvements, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are generated in currencies other than the US dollar, and since we report our financial results in US dollars, we face exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates. If the US dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenues and income. We are also subject to currency exchange risks in connection with our purchase and sale of US dollars and Euro\u2019s in the ordinary course of our business to meet our obligations to our Business Associates, other vendors and creditors. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the US dollar against any currency which affects a material amount of our operations, will affect our revenues, cost of sales, gross profit (loss), operating expenses, or other income and expenses and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. These fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Disruptions in financial markets may result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates in relatively short periods of time which further increases the risk of an adverse currency effect. Since we plan to expand our international operations, we will likely increase our exposure to foreign currency risks. We do not hedge our currency risk, and do not expect to.\nThe inability of our significant participating merchants or our affiliate network agents to meet their payment obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur Cash Back revenues are substantially comprised of cash rebates received from our participating merchants. We do not receive rebates directly from the merchants. We contract with third parties known as \u201caffiliate networks\u201d that establish the contractual relationships with the merchants, provide the tracking links, establish the amount of Cash Back, collect the Cash Back and pay us commissions due. We are subject to credit risk due to both the concentration of our trade accounts receivables in a small number of affiliate networks and the potential for the merchants to fail to pay the affiliate networks the Cash Back that is owed to us. The latter risk is small because we have numerous participating merchants and the failure of a single merchant is less material. Although the accounts of our affiliate networks and our significant participating merchants are current, the inability of either to meet their future obligations to us, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks in connection with our relationships with our domestic and foreign credit card processors who collect membership fees and other fees from our customers, BAs and Partners.\nWe have agreements in place with credit card processors in the United States, Europe, the Middle East and India that process the purchase of membership packages completed on our websites. Pursuant to the current terms and conditions of these agreements, the processors are permitted to maintain a certain percentage of reserve or holdback for a certain period on each sale processed by them. Holdbacks are the portion of the revenues from a credit card transaction that is held in reserve by the credit card processor to cover possible disputed charges, chargeback fees, and other expenses. In the event a credit card processor declares bankruptcy, encounters financial difficulties, refuses or fails to honor its contract with us for any reason or ceases operations, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access funds due to us on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, from time to time, these processors may increase the amount that they keep in reserve as holdbacks. Although we are entitled to receive any remaining holdback amount after a designated period of time, any increase in the holdback percentage would result in a delay in our receiving the full proceeds from the sales of our products. This would adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition.\nWe face risks in connection with our relationships with our foreign mobile payment application processors in India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia who collect membership fees and other fees from our customers, BAs and Partners.\nWe have agreements in place with mobile payment applications in India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia that process the purchase of membership packages completed on our websites. Pursuant to the current terms and conditions of these agreements, the processors are permitted to maintain a certain percentage of reserve or holdback for a certain period on each sale processed by them. Holdbacks are the portion of the revenues from a credit card transaction that is held in reserve by the credit card processor to cover possible disputed charges, chargeback fees, and other expenses. In the event a credit card processor declares bankruptcy, encounters financial difficulties, refuses or fails to honor its contract with us for any reason or ceases operations, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access funds due to us on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, from time to time, these processors may increase the amount that they keep in reserve as holdbacks. Although we are entitled to receive any remaining holdback amount after a designated period of time, any increase in the holdback percentage would result in a delay in our receiving the full proceeds from the sales of our products. This would adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may not be successful in developing brand awareness for our brands, which is critical to our business.\nWe believe that brand recognition is critical to our businesses. In July 2015, we changed the name of our parent company from DubLi, Inc. to Ominto, Inc. and launched a newly branded Ominto.com shopping site in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We must quickly establish a brand identity for Ominto. Although we have brand awareness of our \u201cDubLi\u201d brand, we must establish both DubLi and our new Ominto brand as brands that potential Partners perceive as offering a satisfactory level of value through our products and services. To promote our DubLi brand, we expect to continue to recruit new BAs and to incentivize existing BAs. Without brand awareness, we may not be successful in attracting new customers, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to successfully exploit the opportunity to offer customized shopping websites.\nWe relaunched our existing white label and co-branding ability as our \"BSP Rewards Partner Program.\" These programs offer our profit and non-profit business clients a custom \u201cwhite label\u201d or \u201cco-branded\u201d shopping site so they can monetize their existing customer/constituent base. The white label sites will be powered by the Ominto.com platform and clients will host their own customized landing pages and other selected customized content while retaining their own logos and branding. In contrast, our co-branded program offers Partners an exact replica of the Ominto.com website that bears the Partner\u2019s logos without the Ominto logo. Although we previously offered the DubLi Partner co-brand service, we have not actively marketed it or engaged with our Partners in expanding their customers\u2019 use of the sites. With our new Ominto.com portal and our expanded marketing team, we are seeking significant expansion of this part of our business. To be successful with these programs, we must both establish additional white label and co-branded sites for our Partners and actively support them in engaging their members and constituents on shopping on our sites. If we are not able to do this, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nCustomer complaints, negative publicity or our security measures could diminish our business.\nCustomer complaints, negative publicity or poor customer service could severely diminish consumer confidence in, and use, of our products and services. If we fail to consistently promote our merchant sites, or if there are rumors, articles, reviews or blogs that indicate or suggest that we have failed to consistently promote such offerings, our business could decrease. Similarly, measures we take to combat fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to damage relations with our shoppers or decrease activity on our sites by making our sites more difficult to use or restricting the activities of certain users. Negative publicity about, or negative experiences with, customer support for any of our business models could cause our reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in our brand as a whole.\nWe are dependent on key employees.\nOur success depends upon the efforts of our top management team and certain other key employees, including the efforts of Michael Hansen (Founder and Chief Executive Officer) and Betina Dupont Sorensen (Chief Operating Officer). Although we have written employment agreements with these key employees, such individuals could die, become disabled, or resign. In addition, our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key management persons for a variety of positions in the Company. We may not be able to recruit and employ such executives at times and on terms acceptable to us. Also, changes in our overall compensation program (including our equity compensation program) and volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, may adversely affect our ability to retain such key employees.\nOur business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes, which may dissuade our users from utilizing our portals.\nThe application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d), goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax) to e-commerce businesses and to our users is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the Internet and e-commerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the Internet or e-commerce or communications conducted over the Internet. In addition, some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the Internet or some aspect of e-commerce or communications on the Internet.\nOne or more states, the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection, reporting or record-keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance. One or more other jurisdictions may also seek to impose tax-collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an e-commerce transaction, regardless of where the respective users are located. Imposition of a discriminatory record-keeping or tax-collecting requirement could decrease the number of participating merchants and would harm our results of operations.\nWe pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases within the various foreign countries in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from the various foreign countries. However, because of our unique business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our operating results.\nAny interruptions in Internet service could harm our business.\nOur customers need access to the Internet to access our shopping website. We have experienced short system failures from time to time. The success of our business also depends largely on the continued availability of the Internet infrastructure. Frequent or persistent interruptions in availability of our sites could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. If we fail to maintain a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security, as well as timely development of complementary products our business may be harmed If our customers are unable to rely on access to our shopping portals, we could lose existing customers, impair our ability to attract new customers and experience loss of revenue from shopping that did not occur while the portals were unavailable.\nThe Internet has experienced significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic, a trend likely to continue. The Internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands. In addition, increasing numbers of users, increasing bandwidth requirements, or problems caused by \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms,\u201d malware and similar programs may harm the performance of the Internet. The backbone computers of the Internet have been the targets of such programs. Although our systems have been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences through worldwide redundant servers, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events. Our systems are also subject to hackings, break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. We do not carry business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. These internet outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage generally, as well as the level of usage of our shopping portals.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing online retailer relationships, we will be unable to operate profitably.\nOur ability to continue to grow our revenues will depend in large part on maintaining our positive reputation with existing online retailers. The number of online retailers offering Cash Back on our sites may not expand materially beyond our existing base or may decline. Online retailers also may reduce the commission rates they pay to us for sales our websites facilitate. If we, or our affiliate networks, who have the direct relationships with most of our online retailers, are unable to negotiate favorable terms with current or new online retailers in the future, including the commission rates they pay us, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOnline retailers do not enter into long-term contracts requiring them to be included on our Cash Back websites and their contracts with us are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. We cannot be sure that the online retailers with whom our affiliate networks have a relationship will continue to be included on our websites or that we will be able to replace online retailers that do not renew their campaigns with new ones generating comparable revenues. If we are unable to retain and expand online retailer relationships, our revenues will decrease and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nRegulatory, legislative or self-regulatory developments regarding Internet privacy matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nConsumer and industry groups have expressed concerns about online data collection and use by companies, which has resulted in the release of various industry self-regulatory codes of conduct and best practice guidelines that are binding for member companies and that govern, among other things, the ways in which companies can collect, use and disclose user information, how companies must give notice of these practices and what choices companies must provide to consumers regarding these practices. We are obligated in certain cases to comply with best practices or codes of conduct addressing matters, such as the online tracking of users or devices. US regulatory agencies have also placed an increased focus on online privacy matters and, in particular, on online advertising activities that utilize cookies, which are small files of non-personalized information placed on an Internet user\u2019s computer, and other online tracking methods. Such regulatory agencies have released, or are expected to release, reports pertaining to these matters. Since March 2012, the FTC, issued a report on consumer privacy intended to articulate best practices for companies collecting and using consumer data. The report recommends companies adopt several practices that could have an impact on our business, including giving consumers notice and offering them choices about being tracked across other parties\u2019 websites and implementing a persistent \u201cDo Not Track\u201d mechanism to enable consumers to choose whether to allow tracking of their online search and browsing activities, including on mobile devices. Various industry participants have worked to develop and finalize standards relating to a Do Not Track mechanism, and such standards may be implemented and adopted by industry participants at any time. We may be required or otherwise choose to adopt Do Not Track mechanisms, in which case our ability to use tracking technologies could be impaired.\nUS and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants\u2019 ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share anonymous data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools. A number of bills have been proposed in the US Congress in the past that contained provisions that would have regulated how companies can use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and use information about consumers. Some of those bills also contained provisions that would have specifically regulated the collection and use of information, particularly geo-location information, from mobile devices. At least one such bill presently has been proposed in the US Congress.\nAdditionally, the EU has traditionally imposed strict obligations under data privacy laws and regulations. Individual EU member countries have had discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of EU data privacy laws, resulting in variation of privacy standards from country to country. Legislation and regulation in the EU and some EU member states requires companies to obtain specific types of notice and consent from consumers before using cookies or other tracking technologies. To comply with these requirements, the use of cookies or other similar technologies may require the user\u2019s affirmative, opt-in consent. Additionally, in January 2012, the European Commission announced significant proposed reforms to its existing data protection legal framework that, if implemented, may result in a greater compliance burden with respect to our operations in Europe.\nChanges in global privacy laws and regulations and self-regulatory regimes may force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. This could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategies effectively and may adversely affect the demand for our solutions or otherwise harm our business and financial condition. For instance, new privacy laws or regulations or changed interpretations of existing laws or regulations could require performance marketing networks or us to take additional measures to facilitate consumer privacy preferences or to limit or cease altogether the collection, use or disclosure of data. The recent FTC staff report also recommends that websites offer consumers a choice about whether the owner of the website can use third parties to track the consumer\u2019s activity for certain purposes. We are dependent on third parties, including performance marketing networks, to place cookies on browsers of users that visit our websites. If in the future we are restricted from allowing cookies, if there is a material increase in the number of users who choose to opt out or block cookies and other tracking technologies, or if performance marketing networks\u2019 cookies or other tracking mechanisms otherwise do not function properly, our ability to generate net revenues would be significantly impaired.\nWe may be subject to foreign laws regulating online advertising even in jurisdictions where we do not have any physical presence to the extent a digital media content provider has advertising inventory that we manage or to the extent that we collect and use data from consumers in those jurisdictions. Such laws may vary widely around the world, making it costly for us to comply with them. Failure to comply may harm our business and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, e-commerce and m-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to foreign and domestic general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce and m-commerce in a number of jurisdictions around the world. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce, m-commerce or other online services. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, data protection, gaming, multi-level marketing, wire transfers, distribution controls, libel and defamation, copyrights, electronic contracts, electronic communications and consumer protection. It is not clear how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet, e-commerce or m-commerce.\nThose laws that govern privacy or reference the Internet, such as the US\u2019s Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) and the European Union\u2019s Directives on Distance Selling and Electronic Commerce, are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. US regulatory agencies have placed an increased focus on online privacy matters and, in particular, on online advertising activities that utilize cookies, which are small files of non-personalized information placed on an Internet user\u2019s computer, and other online tracking methods. For example the FTC recommends companies adopt several practices that could have an impact on our business, including giving consumers notice and offering them choices about being tracked across other parties\u2019 websites and implementing a persistent \u201cDo Not Track\u201d mechanism to enable consumers to choose whether to allow tracking of their online search and browsing activities, including on mobile devices. The EU\u2019s stricter obligations under data privacy laws and regulations provide its member countries wide discretion in interpreting the EU data privacy laws, resulting in variation of privacy standards from country to country.\nChanges in global privacy laws and regulations and self-regulatory regimes may force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. Furthermore, regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to licensure or prohibition from conducting our business in their jurisdiction, either generally or with respect to certain actions. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce or m-commerce may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. We cannot assure you that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant resources in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, and cause consumers and online retailers to decrease their use of our marketplace, and may result in the imposition of monetary consequences. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of noncompliance with any such laws or regulations. In addition, it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our websites and mobile applications or may even attempt to completely block access to our marketplace. Laws regulating Internet and e-commerce companies outside of the US may be less favorable than those in the US, giving greater rights to consumers, competitors or users. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our product offerings, and the imposition of any regulations on our users may harm our business. In addition, we may be subject to overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us. Our failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our products. Adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business. In particular, in the event that we are restricted, in whole or in part, from operating in one or more countries, our ability to retain or increase our customer base may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain or grow our net revenues as anticipated.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover any business loss.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our business could suffer. Although we have all-risk property insurance for our operating properties covering damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters or certain acts of terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions. Our level of insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all possible losses in the event of a major casualty. Therefore, certain acts and events could expose us to substantial uninsured losses. More important than the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events. While we do carry general liability insurance, including coverage for identity theft, we do not carry business interruption insurance. The insurance we do carry may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and, in any event, may not be adequate to cover all losses.\nOur failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our platform and network against security breaches, or otherwise protect our confidential information, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe deliver digital content via our shopping website and we collect and maintain data about consumers, including personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential or proprietary information. Our security measures may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted by our platform or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. Breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers could result in unauthorized access to our platform or other systems; unauthorized access to and misappropriation of consumer information, including consumers\u2019 personally identifiable information, or other confidential or proprietary information of ourselves or third parties; viruses, worms, spyware or other malware being served from our platform; deletion or modification of content, or the display of unauthorized content, on our websites or our mobile applications; or a denial of service or other interruption in our operations. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers, we and they may be unable to anticipate these attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures. Potential liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. This liability could also include claims for other misuse of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes. Any of these claims could result in litigation. Liability for misappropriation of this information could adversely affect our business. In addition, the FTC and state agencies have been investigating various Internet companies regarding their use of personal information. We could incur additional expenses from the introduction of new regulations regarding the use of personal information or from government agencies investigating our privacy practices. Any actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation and brand, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, require us to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such breaches and deter consumers and online retailers from using our online marketplace, which would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, such as customer credit card numbers.\nWe cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise of our security were to occur, it could harm our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. We cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches will not harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property adequately could adversely affect our business.\nOur proprietary technology is one of the keys to our performance and ability to remain competitive. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trade secret, and contract laws to establish and protect the proprietary nature of our technology. Much of the software that we use was specifically developed by the Company and, accordingly, we believe we have certain proprietary rights to the software. Prior to September 2016, we have used employees to develop the software that we consider to be proprietary to our business, and are generally deemed under copyright law to be the author of the software. On September 14, 2016, the Company entered into a strategic relationship with Quant Systems, Inc. (\u201cQuant\u201d) in which Quant provides advisory and information technology solutions consulting to the Company, including technical consulting, software implementation and re-engineering. Refer to \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d on page 43 for more information regarding Quant. We have a general practice of requiring our employees to enter into confidentiality, invention assignment and non-compete agreements to provide trade secret and contractual protections for our software as well as other confidential and proprietary technical and business information and ideas. We also use technical and business measures to protect our proprietary rights. For example, we limit distribution of our software, maintain it in physically secure locations with restricted access, and use firewalls to try to keep out intruders, and we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants, business partners, and other third parties. Nonetheless, the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology and other information may not prevent misappropriation of our technology, and the agreements we enter into for that purpose might not be enforceable. Our trade secrets or proprietary technology may become known or be independently developed by competitors. We have copyrights without registering our software or other works of authorship, but we have not registered our copyrights with the US Copyright Office or any other copyright office, and would not be entitled to the additional protections afforded by such registration. We do not rely on and do not have any patent protections at this time on our technology. As such, due to certain legal requirements in timely filing for patent protection, the lack of filing for patent protection could present obstacles to us in the future should we decide to proceed with filing for patent protection. It is difficult for us to police the unauthorized use of our technology, particularly because the global nature of the Internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software or other transmitted data. The laws of other countries may not provide us with adequate or effective protection of our intellectual property. We have not undertaken a review of third-party patents in any jurisdiction to try to determine if a third-party may claim that we infringe on its patent or other proprietary rights, and do not plan in the near future to do so. Such a claim, if vigorously pursued, could require, among other things, substantial resources to fight, that we stop using most or substantial and important parts of our technology, that we expend additional resources to try to replace such technology with non-infringing technology which may not have the same features, usability, maintainability, or customer acceptance, and the Company to pay sums as damages that we could not afford to pay.\nOur inability to adequately protect our brands, or claims that our brands are similar to third-party brand owners, could adversely affect our business.\nOur trademarks, service marks, trade names and trade dress (also sometimes known as brands) provide value to the Company and its affiliates. We have a compliance process in place for DubLi Network BAs to follow so that they do not violate our service marks and use the Company brands inappropriately. We currently have trademarks registered or pending in the US, Europe, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, and all of the contracting parties (countries) of the Madrid protocol for our name and certain words and phrases that we use in our business including, but not limited to, DubLi Worldwide Trading, Ominto, DubLi, Dubot and others. Although we believe that our \u201cOminto\u201d and \u201cDubLi\u201d and other trade names and logos have certain intellectual property protections, our competitors or others could adopt product or service names similar to \u201cOminto\u201d, \u201cDubLi\u201d or our other service marks or trademarks. We may or may not be able to register all of our brands in every country where we seek registration and there can be no assurance that registered trademarks will protect our brands. Any of the foregoing might impede our ability to build brand identity and could lead to customer confusion. Our inability to protect our service marks, trademarks or other brands adequately could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and the value of our brand name and other intangible assets. Conversely, third parties who use, develop or register service marks, trademarks or other brands similar to ours in countries in which we do business or intend to do business may claim that our brands infringe upon their registered or common law rights in those countries. We therefore, cannot assure you that we will be able to use our brands in every country where we wish to do business. Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using technology, content, branding or business methods found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. Any of these events could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our business and maintain competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business.\nWe depend on the use of information technologies and systems. As our operations grow in size and scope, we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our infrastructure. Our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our systems and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of our solutions in response to competitive services and product offerings. The emergence of alternative platforms such as smart phones and tablets and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms will require new investment in technology. New developments in other areas, such as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower up-front technology costs. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a cost-effective manner.\nOur ability to develop successful website enhancements is a significant component of our business strategy and a failure to do so could harm our business.\nWe developed a new platform for our e-commerce shopping portals to better provide our online shoppers with an enjoyable experience. We launched our new portal in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our ability to succeed in enhancing our sites and other offerings may require significant resources and management attention. The success of new and enhanced products depends on several factors, including our ability to develop and complete these introductions in a timely manner, successfully promote the portals, manage the risks associated with the enhancements, make sufficient resources available to support them, secure appropriate intellectual property rights and address any quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Despite the allocation of resources, there can be no assurance that the new enhancements or product offerings will be developed successfully, timely released, or accepted by our customers.\nOur establishment and integration of our Ominto.com platform could result in the diversion or loss of resources, operating difficulties and other harmful consequences.\nWe launched our new Ominto.com Cash Back platform in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our new platform will offer enhanced features which will also become available on our DubLi.com white label site. Establishing an enhanced platform may be time consuming, difficult and more expensive than our budgeted projections. There are no assurances that the Company will recoup any of the expenditures with respect to establishing the new platform. The new platform allows us to more efficiently offer both white label and co-branded sites to our business clients. We believe that expansion of our business clients' sites will be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to acquire new Ominto.com shoppers in large quantities based upon certain existing relationships of our newer business clients who wish to establish white label sites for their customers. We may face:\n\u25cf diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the business to issues related to integration and administration;\n\u25cf the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u25cf problems enhancing the operations, technologies or products;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs; and\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with merchants, customers and Business Associates.\nMoreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our shopping platform and expansion of our business client sites, or may not realize them in the expected time frame.\nAcquisitions and joint ventures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, technologies, services, products and other assets. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky. The areas where we may face difficulties include:\n\u25cf diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration, particularly given the varying scope of our recent acquisitions;\n\u25cf declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in, or acceleration of, compensation, or changes in Management, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of the business;\n\u25cf the need to integrate each company\u2019s accounting, management, information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;\n\u25cf the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u25cf in some cases, the need to transition operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\u25cf problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with online retailers and customers;\n\u25cf risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations; and\n\u25cf liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.\nMoreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our transactions, or may not realize them in the expected time frame. Future acquisitions or mergers may require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, liabilities, and amortize expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business.\nIn addition, we may make certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control. These investments may involve risks. For example, the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with our business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture.\nRisks Specific to our DubLi Network Business\nOur DubLi Network operates in a highly competitive niche.\nWithin the direct selling channel, we compete on a regional and often country-by-country basis with our direct marketing competitors. We compete within a distinct business model where providing a compelling earnings opportunity for our Business Associates is as critical as developing and marketing new and innovative products. Therefore, in contrast to a typical company which operates within a broad-based consumer pool, we must first compete for a limited pool of Business Associates before we reach the ultimate consumer.\nDirect sellers compete for representative or entrepreneurial talent both by their product or service and by providing a competitive earnings opportunity that is more compelling than that offered by the competition. Our competitors regularly offer field incentives such as trips and other bonuses. Our competitors devote substantial effort to determining the effectiveness of field incentives so that they can invest in incentives that are the most cost effective or produce greater payback. We are not currently offering field incentives. We are and expect to continue to be subject to significant competition for the recruitment of Business Associates from other direct selling or network marketing organizations. We are always enhancing our direct selling model as well as recruiting new Business Associates. If we are unable to do so our business will be adversely affected.\nSuccess of our DubLi Network business is dependent on the ability and productivity of our Business Associates.\nOur DubLi.com revenues are generated through the efforts of our network of Business Associates (our independent marketing representatives) whose drive individual consumer traffic and business client's customers traffic to the DubLi.com shopping site. DubLi.com is the product of DubLi Network and, as such, requires the network to penetrate consumer registrations. To increase our revenues, we must increase the productivity of this network. Therefore, our success depends, in significant part, upon our ability to recruit, educate, retain and motivate our Business Associates and their ability to expand their organization network and to generate customers who shop at our shopping portal. Our operating results could be harmed if our existing and new business opportunities do not generate sufficient interest to retain and motivate existing Business Associates and attract new Business Associates; or if we fail to educate them about our products in ways that ensure their success or if we fail to properly support them in their efforts.\nThe primary way we recruit new Business Associates is through a network marketing strategy. The success of a network marketing force is highly dependent upon our ability to offer a viable product, education, commission structure and sales incentive program that enables our Business Associates to recruit and develop other Business Associates. To compete with other network marketing organizations, we may be required to increase our cost of revenues and marketing costs through increases in commissions, sales incentives or other features, any of which could adversely impact our future earnings. We may experience a high rate of turnover among Business Associates, which is a characteristic of the network marketing business. The loss of a significant number of Business Associates for any reason could negatively impact sales and could impair our ability to attract new Business Associates. In addition, the level of confidence of the Business Associates in our ability to perform is an important factor in maintaining and growing our Business Associate network. Adverse publicity or negative financial developments concerning the Company could adversely affect our ability to maintain the confidence of our Business Associates.\nOur Business Associates may not comply with our policies and procedures.\nOur Business Associates are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction, motivation and oversight as we would if the Business Associates were employed by the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance that our Business Associates will participate in our marketing strategies or plans or comply with our Business Associate policies and procedures and terms and conditions.\nExtensive federal, state and local laws regulate our business and network marketing program. Because we conduct operations in foreign countries, our policies and procedures for our Business Associates may differ due to the different legal requirements of each country in which we do business. While we have implemented Business Associate policies and procedures designed to govern Business Associate conduct and to protect the goodwill associated with our trademarks and trade names, it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of Business Associates and their independent status. Violations by our independent Business Associates of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our operations and harm our business reputation. In addition, it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our independent Business Associates.\nOur network marketing program could be found to be not in compliance with current or newly adopted laws or regulations in one or more markets.\nOur DubLi Network marketing program is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and various state agencies in the United States, as well as regulations on direct selling in foreign markets administered by foreign agencies. We are subject to the risk that, in one or more markets, our network marketing program could be found not to comply with applicable law or regulations. Regulations applicable to network marketing organizations generally are directed at preventing fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as \u201cpyramid\u201d or \u201cchain sales\u201d schemes, by ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within an organization is based on sales of the organization\u2019s products rather than investments in the organization or other non-retail sales-related criteria. The regulatory requirements concerning network marketing programs do not include \u201cbright line\u201d rules and are inherently fact-based, and thus, even in jurisdictions where we believe that our network marketing program is in full compliance with applicable laws or regulations governing network marketing systems, we are subject to the risk that these laws or regulations or the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by governmental agencies or courts can change. The failure of our network marketing program to comply with current or newly adopted regulations could negatively impact our business in a particular market or in general.\nOur ability to conduct a Network Marketing business in international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nWe intend to expand our international penetration with our DubLi Network business. Our ability to capitalize on new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is exposed to risks associated with our international operations including, among others:\n\u25cf the possibility that a foreign government might ban or severely restrict our business method of direct selling;\n\u25cf the possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax or other financial burdens on our Business Associates, as direct sellers, or on DubLi Network, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets;\n\u25cf the possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our Business Associates as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our Business Associates;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; or\n\u25cf the burden and administrative costs of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.\nRisks Relating to Our Stock\nWe are significantly influenced by one stockholder who controls a substantial voting percentage of our common stock.\nAs of December 15, 2016, Mr. Hansen owns approximately 2.9 million shares of common stock and 185,000 shares of Super Voting Preferred Stock entitled to 40 votes per share, collectively representing approximately 41% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding voting securities. Accordingly, Mr. Hansen has the power to influence or control the outcome of important corporate decisions or matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Although Mr. Hansen owes the Company certain fiduciary duties as Director and CEO of the Company, the interests of Mr. Hansen may conflict with, or differ from, the interests of other holders of our common stock. So long as Mr. Hansen has the power to vote a substantial percentage of shares of our voting securities, he will have the power to significantly influence all our corporate decisions and will be able to affect or inhibit changes in control of the Company.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile, and this volatility may continue. For instance, during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, the low and high sale price of our common stock, as reported on the markets on which our securities have traded, ranged between $1.60 and $14.00. In November, 2015, we effectuated a 1 for 50 reverse stock split which was previously approved by the Board of Directors. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our shares of common stock to fluctuate significantly. These factors include:\n\u25cf our earnings releases, actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of financial market analysts and investors;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u25cf speculation about our business in the press or the investment community;\n\u25cf significant developments relating to our relationships with our Business Associates, business clients, customers or merchants;\n\u25cf stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in the e-commerce based industry;\n\u25cf customer demand for our products;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and trends;\n\u25cf major catastrophic events;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles;\n\u25cf loss of external funding sources;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock, including divestments by our directors, officers or significant stockholders;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf announcements of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain financing;\n\u25cf developments in our or our competitors\u2019 intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf failure to meet the expectation of securities analysts or the public;\n\u25cf our ability to expand our operations, domestically and internationally;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of expenditures related to any expansion;\n\u25cf litigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in expectations by investors or analysts regarding our performance; and\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Our stock price is volatile and we could be a target of stockholder litigation. Any stockholder litigation brought against us in the future could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nMoreover, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our shares of common stock and other interests in our Company at a time when you want to sell your interest in us.\nWe have significant \u201cequity overhang\u201d which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had 13,386,538 shares of common stock outstanding. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, 1.6 million shares of our common stock were issuable upon exercise, conversion, or vesting of outstanding options, stock grants, shares issuable for the payment of services. The possibility that substantial amounts of our common stock may be sold by investors or the perception that such sales could occur, often called \u201cequity overhang,\u201d could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities in the future.\nThe rights of the holders of common stock may be impaired by the potential issuance of preferred stock.\nOur Board has the right, without stockholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights. This could adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of common stock which could be issued with the right to more than one vote per share, and could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control. Michael Hansen, the Company\u2019s President and CEO, owns 185,000 shares of \u201cSuper-Voting Preferred Stock\u201d which entitles him to 40 votes per share of Super Voting Preferred Stock or 7.4 million votes of common stock.\nThe power to issue additional shares of preferred stock or common stock could, in some situations, have the effect of discouraging and/or rendering more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or any other attempt to obtain control of the Company. This may limit the opportunity for stockholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to create any new series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.", "PERMNO": 16640, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "OMNT"}
