Risk Factors\nRisks related to our business and industry\nRegulatory compliance is expensive, complex and uncertain, and a failure to comply could lead to enforcement actions against us and other negative consequences for our business.\nThe FDA and similar state and foreign agencies regulate our products as medical devices. Complying with these regulations is costly, time consuming, complex and uncertain. FDA regulations and regulations of similar state and foreign agencies are wide-ranging and include oversight of:\n\u2022\nproduct design, development, manufacture (including supply chain) and testing;\n\u2022\npre-clinical and clinical studies;\n\u2022\nproduct safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nproduct labeling;\n\u2022\nproduct storage and shipping;\n\u2022\nrecord keeping;\n\u2022\npre-market clearance or approval;\n\u2022\nmarketing, advertising and promotion;\n\u2022\nproduct sales and distribution;\n\u2022\nproduct changes;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls; and\n\u2022\npost-market surveillance and reporting of deaths or serious injuries.\nAll of our potential products and improvements of our current products are subject to extensive regulation and will likely require permission from regulatory agencies and ethics boards to conduct clinical trials, and clearance or approval from the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies prior to commercial sale and distribution. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements regarding, for example, promoting, manufacturing or labeling our products, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial actions and sanctions, such as Form 483 deficiency notices, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to approve pending applications. Any enforcement action by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn January 2016, following an inspection of certain of our manufacturing facilities from late 2015 to early 2016, the FDA issued us a Form 483 notice, identifying certain observed non-conformities with current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201cGMP\u201d), as defined by the FDA. Following the receipt of the Form 483, we provided written responses to the FDA detailing corrective actions underway to address the FDA\u2019s observations. In May 2016, we received a warning letter from the FDA related to observed non-conformities with current GMP, at our Colorado Springs, Colorado facility. We plan to continue to respond timely and fully to the FDA\u2019s requests, and we are working diligently to fully remediate the FDA\u2019s observations regarding the Colorado Springs facility. We anticipate that we will incur incremental expenses ranging from approximately $10 million to approximately $15 million in 2017 in connection with remediating the warning letter. We are continuing to manufacture and ship disposable products from the Colorado Springs facility and we currently do not anticipate that customer orders will be impacted while we work to resolve the FDA\u2019s concerns. Until the violations are corrected, we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, including recalls, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals or clearances, and fines or civil penalties.\nOur products may be subject to recalls after receiving FDA or foreign approval or clearance, which could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of our products because of any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary product recall by us could occur because of, for example, component failures, device malfunctions, or other adverse events, such as serious injuries or deaths, or quality-related issues such as manufacturing errors or design or labeling defects. We have conducted voluntary recalls in the past and may do so in the future. For a discussion of a recent voluntary recall, please refer to Note 13, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this annual report. Any future recalls of our products could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation and adversely affect our business. The FDA may also order us to reimburse parties affected by the recall of our products.\nIn addition, we are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA or similar foreign governmental authorities if one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if we become aware that it has malfunctioned in a way that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction recurred. Failures to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports can subject us to sanctions and penalties. Physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers may make similar reports. Any such reports may trigger an investigation by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory bodies, which could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies in our highly competitive industry.\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive. Our primary competitors are manufacturers of products used in competing therapies within the peripheral and coronary atherectomy and lead management markets, such as:\n\u2022\natherectomy and thrombectomy, using mechanical methods to remove arterial blockages;\n\u2022\nballoon angioplasty and stents;\n\u2022\nspecialty balloon angioplasty, such as scoring balloons, pillowing balloons, cutting balloons and drug-coated balloons;\n\u2022\nbypass surgery;\n\u2022\namputation; and\n\u2022\nmechanical lead removal tools.\nWe believe that the primary competitive factors in the interventional peripheral and coronary markets include:\n\u2022\nthe ability to treat a variety of lesions safely and effectively as demonstrated by credible clinical data;\n\u2022\nease of use;\n\u2022\nthe impact of managed care practices, related reimbursement to the healthcare provider and procedure costs;\n\u2022\nsize and effectiveness of sales forces; and\n\u2022\nresearch and development capabilities.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, commercial and technical resources than we do. There has been consolidation in the industry, and we expect that to continue. Larger competitors may have substantially larger sales and marketing operations than we do. This may allow those competitors to spend more time with potential customers and to focus on a larger number of potential customers, which gives them a significant advantage over our sales and marketing team and our international distributors in making sales. At times, we have experienced significant sales personnel turnover, and sales personnel turnover could be an issue in the future.\nLarger competitors may also have broader product lines, which enables them to offer customers bundled purchase contracts and quantity discounts. These competitors may have more experience than we have in research and development, marketing, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. Our competitors may discover technologies and techniques, or enter into partnerships and collaborations, to develop competing products that are more effective or less costly than our products or the products we may develop. This may render our technology or products obsolete or noncompetitive. Academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations may seek patent protection regarding potentially competitive products or technologies and may establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. Our competitors may be better equipped than we are to respond to competitive pressures. Competition will likely intensify.\nTechnological change may adversely affect sales of our products and may cause our products to become obsolete.\nThe medical device market is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Technological progress or new developments in our industry could adversely affect sales of our products. Our products could be rendered obsolete because of future innovations by our competitors or others in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.\nWe may be unable to sustain our revenue growth.\nOur ability to continue to increase our revenue in future periods will depend on our ability to successfully penetrate our target markets and increase sales of our VI products and LM products and generate significant sales from our Stellarex DCB catheters and new and improved products we introduce, which will, in turn, depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and obtaining orders from those customers. New products will also need to be developed and approved or cleared by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies to sustain revenue growth in our markets. Additional clinical data and new products may be necessary to grow revenue. We may not be able to generate, sustain, or increase revenue on a quarterly or annual basis. If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.\nOur products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance.\nEven if we obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approval or clearance of our products, or new indications for our products, market acceptance of our products in the healthcare community, including physicians, patients and third-party payers, depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to provide incremental clinical and economic data that shows the safety and clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of, and patient benefits from, our products;\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nwhether our products are included on insurance company formularies;\n\u2022\nthe willingness and ability of patients and the healthcare community to adopt new technologies;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of use of our products relative to other treatment methods;\n\u2022\nthe pricing and reimbursement of our products relative to other treatment methods; and\n\u2022\nthe marketing and distribution support for our products.\nEven if we obtain all necessary FDA and foreign regulatory approvals and clearances, any of our products may fail to achieve market acceptance. If we do not educate physicians about PAD and the need to address cardiac device infection through lead removal and the existence of our products, these products may not gain market acceptance, as many physicians do not routinely screen for PAD while screening for coronary artery disease and are not aware of the need to remove and replace coronary leads when treating cardiac device infections. If our products achieve market acceptance, they may not maintain that market acceptance over time if competing products or technologies are introduced that are received more favorably or are more cost effective. Our Lead Management\nproducts are used, in part, to remove advisory leads, which are leads for which a physician advisory has been issued by the manufacturer of the lead. When the advisory leads are extracted or become inactive, the market for our Lead Management products will be reduced. Failure to achieve or maintain market acceptance would limit our ability to generate revenue and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals, our business may be harmed.\nFor planning, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development and commercialization goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. We base these milestones on a variety of assumptions, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. There is a risk we will not achieve these milestones on a timely basis or at all. Even if we achieve these milestones, the actual timing of the achievement of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, often for reasons beyond our control, depending on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress, costs and results of our clinical trials and research and development activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria;\n\u2022\nthe extent of scheduling conflicts with participating physicians and clinical institutions;\n\u2022\nadverse reactions reported during clinical trials or commercialization;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our products to meet the standards for clearance or approval;\n\u2022\nthe receipt of IDEs, marketing approvals and clearances by our competitors and by us from the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022\nother actions by regulators, including actions related to a class of products.\nIf we do not meet these milestones for our products or if we are delayed in achieving these milestones, the development and commercialization of new products, modifications of existing products or sales of existing products for new approved indications may be prevented or delayed, which could damage our reputation or materially adversely affect our business. Even if we achieve a milestone for a product, market acceptance for the product is not assured.\nWe have a history of losses and may not return to profitability.\nWe incurred net losses from our inception in 1984 until 2000, and again in 2002, 2006, from 2008 to 2010 and from 2013 to 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had accumulated $252.7 million in net losses since inception. We may not be profitable in the future.\nWe have made certain assumptions relating to the AngioScore and Stellarex acquisitions that have proven in the past and may prove in the future to be materially inaccurate.\nWe have made certain assumptions relating to the AngioScore and Stellarex acquisitions that relate to numerous matters, including:\n\u2022\nprojections of future revenue and revenue growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe amount of goodwill and intangibles resulting from the acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncertain other purchase accounting adjustments that are being recorded in our financial statements in connection with the acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with customers; and\n\u2022\nother financial and strategic risks of the acquisitions.\nCertain assumptions relating to the AngioScore and Stellarex acquisitions may prove to be inaccurate. For example, for 2015 and 2016, the first two full fiscal years subsequent to the AngioScore acquisition, we failed to achieve the revenue growth that we projected at the time of the acquisition. Our assumptions relating to the AngioScore and Stellarex acquisitions may be inaccurate in the future, which may result in our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions, failure to realize expected revenue growth rates, failure to receive product clearances or approvals in a timely manner or at all, higher than expected operating, transaction and integration costs, failure to integrate acquired personnel, loss of key employees, loss of key vendors, as well as general economic and business conditions that may adversely affect us following the acquisitions. If our assumptions regarding these acquisitions prove to be inaccurate and we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth or we experience higher costs for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.\nIf we cannot obtain additional funding, we may be unable to make desirable acquisitions or fund expanding growth and operations.\nWe may require additional funds to make acquisitions of desirable companies, products or technologies, or fund expanding growth and operations. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The inability to obtain additional capital may restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to make desirable acquisitions. Any equity or convertible debt financing may result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIf we do not manage our growth or control costs related to growth, our results of operations will suffer.\nWe intend to grow our business by expanding our customer base, sales force and product offerings, including through additional acquisitions or other business combinations. Growth could place significant strain on our management, employees, operations, operating and financial systems, and other resources. To accommodate significant growth, we could be required to open additional facilities, expand and improve our information systems and procedures and hire, train, motivate and manage a growing workforce, all of which would increase our costs. Our systems, facilities, procedures and personnel may not be adequate to support our future operations. Further, we may not maintain or accelerate our current growth, manage our expanding operations or achieve planned growth on a timely and profitable basis.\nLitigation and other legal proceedings may adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time we are involved in legal proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property matters, product liability claims, employee claims, tort or contract claims, federal regulatory investigations, securities class action, and other legal proceedings or investigations, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and can result in excessive or unanticipated verdicts and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. We could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or for agreements to change the way we operate our business, or both. There may be an increase in the scope of these matters or there may be additional lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on us. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers\u2019 confidence and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.\nWe must indemnify officers and directors, including, in certain circumstances, former employees and directors, against all losses, including expenses, incurred by them in legal proceedings and advance their reasonable legal defense expenses, unless certain conditions apply. We are indemnifying and advancing legal defense expenses for an officer and former officer in connection with the securities class action litigation described below, and we also have incurred significant advancement costs in connection with AngioScore\u2019s litigation with a former director as\ndescribed below. Insurance for claims of this nature does not apply in all such circumstances, may be denied or may not be adequate to cover all legal or other costs related to the proceeding. A prolonged uninsured expense and indemnification obligation could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe have been named as a defendant in a securities class action lawsuit that may result in substantial costs and could divert management\u2019s attention.\nOn August 27, 2015, a person purporting to represent a class of persons who purchased our securities between February 19, 2015 and July 23, 2015 filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The lawsuit asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that certain of our public statements concerning our projected revenue for 2015 were false and misleading. Plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, interest, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation. On March 1, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, including additional allegations challenging certain statements made by us. The class period in the amended complaint runs from February 27, 2014 to July 23, 2015. We filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in June 2016, plaintiffs filed their response in July 2016, and we filed our reply brief in August 2016.\nWe are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this action. It is possible it could be resolved adversely to us, result in substantial costs, result in derivative actions and additional claims, and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business. While we maintain director and officer liability insurance and have submitted this claim to our carriers who have acknowledged coverage and reserved their rights under the policies, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim, and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition, could subject us to adverse publicity, and require us to incur significant legal fees.\nWe may incur substantial costs because of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, which could cause substantial costs and liability.\nThere may be patents and patent applications owned by others relating to peripheral and coronary atherectomy products, lead management products, specialty balloons, drug-coated balloons, or other technologies, which, if determined to be valid and enforceable, may be infringed by us. Holders of certain patents, including holders of patents involving the use of lasers, catheters, specialty balloons or drug-coated balloons in the body, may contact us and request we enter into license agreements for the underlying technology and pay them royalties, which could be substantial.\nIf we need to obtain a license to use any intellectual property, we may be unable to obtain such license on favorable terms or at all or we may be required to make substantial royalty or other payments to use this intellectual property or we may become involved in litigation regarding the use of the relevant intellectual property.\nLitigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable, and could divert the attention of our management from our business operations. We cannot guarantee that other patent holders will not sue us and prevail. An adverse ruling could subject us to significant liability, require us to seek licenses, and restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products. We are, and in the past have been, a party to legal proceedings involving our intellectual property and may be a party to future proceedings. For a discussion of our legal proceedings, please refer to Note 13, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this annual report. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. An unfavorable outcome in an interference proceeding or patent infringement suit could require us to pay substantial damages, to lose our patent protection, to cease using the technology or to license rights, potentially at a substantial cost, from prevailing third parties. There is no guarantee that any prevailing party would offer us a license or that we\ncould acquire any license on commercially acceptable terms. Even if we can obtain rights to a third-party\u2019s patented intellectual property, those rights may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may obtain access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may have to cease some of our business operations because of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business. To the extent we are found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of others, we may not develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology. If we need to redesign our products to avoid third-party patents, we may suffer significant regulatory delays associated with conducting additional studies or submitting technical, manufacturing or other information related to any redesigned product and, ultimately, in obtaining regulatory approval. Further, any such redesigns may result in less effective or less commercially desirable products or both.\nAngioScore is subject to pending litigation that may materially harm its intellectual property and our business.\nPrior to our acquisition of AngioScore, AngioScore filed a lawsuit in federal district court in California against Eitan Konstantino, a former director of AngioScore and founder of TriReme Medical, LLC (\u201cTrireme\u201d), Quattro Vascular Pte Ltd. (\u201cQuattro\u201d) and QT Vascular Ltd. (\u201cQT Vascular\u201d), which sell a balloon angioplasty device sold under the name \u201cChocolate.\u201d The lawsuit alleged infringement of an AngioScore patent, and state law claims of breach of fiduciary duties by Konstantino while serving as a director of AngioScore, and aiding and abetting of that breach by the other defendants. In July 2015, the district court ruled in favor of AngioScore, finding that Konstantino breached his fiduciary duties to AngioScore, that TriReme and Quattro aided and abetted that breach, and that QT Vascular was liable for the acts of TriReme and Quattro. The district court awarded AngioScore $20.034 million against all defendants plus disgorgement from Konstantino of all benefits he accrued from his breach of fiduciary duties. In September 2015, a jury found against AngioScore in the patent infringement case.\nIn July 2016, an appellate court reversed the state law rulings on procedural grounds, finding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear those claims, and affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling that the defendants were not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees in the patent infringement case. In August 2016, AngioScore filed a petition for rehearing of the order reversing the state law rulings, which the appellate court denied. The appellate court remanded the matter to the district court for dismissal of the state law claims, which the district court did in February 2017.\nIn May 2014, Konstantino filed claims for advancement of fees and costs and indemnification by AngioScore against the breach of fiduciary duty claims. A court held in August 2014 that AngioScore was required to advance the former director\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. AngioScore filed a motion for summary judgment, and in November 2015, the court granted in part AngioScore\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordered that TriReme is liable for 50% of advanced fees and costs, and must pay all fees and costs to be advanced moving forward until such fees and costs equal the fees and costs paid by AngioScore, and thereafter, the fees and costs must be advanced 50% by TriReme and 50% by AngioScore. A judge or jury could determine that AngioScore must ultimately pay the former director\u2019s legal fees and costs defending against the breach of fiduciary duty and other claims, and the fees and costs associated with the dispute regarding indemnification, which could be material. As of December 31, 2015, AngioScore had incurred approximately $12.8 million in advancement costs, which may not be covered by insurance. AngioScore did not incur any advancement costs in 2016.\nIn June 2014, TriReme sued AngioScore seeking to change the inventorship of certain patents owned by AngioScore. TriReme alleges that an Israeli physician, Chaim Lotan, should be named as a co-inventor on three patents owned by AngioScore. Dr. Lotan allegedly assigned any rights he may have had in the three patents to TriReme. In March 2015, the court granted AngioScore\u2019s motion to dismiss this case. In February 2016, an appellate court reversed the lower court\u2019s ruling dismissing the case and remanded the case for further proceedings. In January 2017, AngioScore filed a motion for summary judgment requesting the court to dismiss the case.\nRegardless of whether AngioScore ultimately prevails in this litigation, the defendants and other third parties may use the AngioScore discoveries or technologies without paying damages, licensing fees or royalties to\nus, which could significantly diminish the value of the AngioScore intellectual property. We cannot at this time determine the likelihood of any outcome. As of December 31, 2016, we had no amounts accrued for potential damages. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $1.8 million and $19.9 million, respectively, of legal fees associated with these matters, including amounts advanced for certain of Konstantino\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in 2015. A judge or jury could determine that AngioScore must ultimately pay the former director\u2019s legal fees and costs defending against the breach of fiduciary duty and other claims, and the fees and costs associated with the dispute regarding indemnification. The cost of this litigation may continue to be material to us and may not be covered by insurance. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.\nHealthcare reform initiatives and other administrative and legislative proposals may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in our key markets.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the coverage and reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of proposals to control costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) has made significant changes to the way healthcare is financed by both federal and state governments and private insurers, and has directly impacted the medical device and pharmaceutical industries. The PPACA includes, with limited exceptions, a deductible excise tax of 2.3% on sales of medical devices by entities, including us, which manufacture or import certain medical devices offered for sale in the U.S., including many of our products. The tax was effective January 1, 2013, but is currently suspended under a two-year moratorium that began January 1, 2016. Revenue from many of our products is subject to that excise tax. Congress is currently considering whether to permanently repeal the medical device excise tax.\nCongress has adopted other legislative changes regarding healthcare since it enacted the PPACA. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, could not reach required goals, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year. The 2% Medicare payment reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, unless additional Congressional action is taken, will stay in effect through 2025 due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 signed into law in November 2015. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (\u201cATRA\u201d) also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may cause additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and our financial condition.\nVarious new healthcare reform proposals are emerging at the federal and state level. Any new federal and state healthcare initiatives that may be adopted could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and could have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations.\nProduct clearances and approvals can often be denied or significantly delayed.\nUnder FDA regulations, unless exempt, a new medical device may only be commercially distributed after it has received 510(k) clearance or is the subject of an approved PMA. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical\ndevice through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product not subject to a PMA. Sometimes, a 510(k) clearance must be supported by preclinical and clinical data.\nThe PMA process typically is more costly, lengthy and stringent than the 510(k) process. Unlike a 510(k) review which determines \u201csubstantial equivalence,\u201d a PMA requires that the applicant demonstrate reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective by producing valid scientific evidence, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. Therefore, to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals, we typically must, among other requirements, provide the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities with preclinical and clinical data that demonstrate to their satisfaction that our products satisfy the criteria for clearance or approval. Preclinical testing and clinical trials must comply with the regulations of the FDA and other government authorities in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries.\nWe may be required to obtain new PMAs, PMA supplements or additional 510(k) premarket clearances to market modifications to our existing products. The FDA requires device manufacturers to make and document a determination of whether a modification requires an approval, supplement or clearance; however, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions not to seek approvals, supplements or clearances for particular device modifications. If the FDA requires us to obtain PMAs, PMA supplements or pre-market clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved device, we may be required to cease manufacturing and marketing the modified device and perhaps also to recall such modified device until we obtain FDA clearance or approval. We may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nThe FDA may not approve our current or future PMA applications or supplements or clear our 510(k) applications on a timely basis or at all. Such delays or refusals could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. Any of these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nInternational regulatory approval processes may take longer than the FDA approval process. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA and foreign regulatory requirements, we may not receive regulatory approvals or may be subject to FDA or foreign enforcement actions. We may be unable to obtain future regulatory approval in a timely manner, or at all, especially if existing regulations are changed or new regulations are adopted. For example, the FDA clearance process for the use of excimer laser technology in clearing blocked arteries in the leg took longer than we anticipated due to requests for additional clinical data and changes in regulatory requirements. A failure or delay in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our business.\nIf our clinical trials are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, our business may be harmed.\nProduct development is a long, expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays and to the risk that products may ultimately prove unsafe or ineffective in treating the indications for which they are designed. Completion of the clinical trials usually takes several years or more. We cannot assure you that we will successfully complete clinical testing of our products within the period we have planned, or at all. Even if we achieve positive interim results in clinical trials, these results do not necessarily predict final results, and positive results in early trials do not necessarily indicate success in later trials. Several companies in the medical device industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials.\nWe may experience numerous adverse events during, or because of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval for new products, modification of existing products, or new approved or cleared indications for existing products including:\n\u2022\ndelays in enrolling an adequate number of subjects in clinical trials when competing with other companies;\n\u2022\nenrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or we may experience high drop-out rates of subjects from our clinical trials, resulting in significant delays;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may find the product is not sufficiently safe for investigational use in humans;\n\u2022\nofficials at the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may interpret data from preclinical testing and clinical trials unfavorably or less favorably than we do;\n\u2022\nthere may be delays or failure in obtaining approval of our IDE or clinical trial protocols from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthere may be delays in obtaining institutional review board approvals or government approvals to conduct clinical trials at prospective sites;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may find our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes or facilities unsatisfactory;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations that may negatively affect or delay our ability to bring a product to market or receive approvals or clearances to treat new indications;\n\u2022\nour clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing or to abandon programs;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty managing multiple clinical sites;\n\u2022\ntrial results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in agreeing on acceptable terms with third-party research organizations and trial sites that will conduct the clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nwe, or regulators, may suspend or terminate our clinical trials because the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nFailures or perceived failures in our clinical trials will delay and may prevent our product development and regulatory approval process, damage our business prospects and negatively affect our reputation and competitive position. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, we engage outside parties to perform services related to certain of our clinical studies and trials, and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could cause costs and delays.\nFrom time to time, we engage consultants and contract research organizations to help design, monitor and analyze the results of certain of our clinical studies and trials. The consultants and contract research organizations we engage interact with clinical investigators to enroll patients in our clinical trials. We depend on these consultants, contract research organizations and clinical investigators to perform the clinical studies and trials and monitor and analyze data from these studies and trials under the investigational plan and protocol for the study or trial and in compliance with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting results of clinical studies or trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and the trial participants are adequately protected, as required by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The consultants and contract research organizations also are responsible for protecting confidential patient data and complying with U.S. laws and regulations related to data privacy, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), and equivalent European Union and other foreign laws where such services are provided. We may face delays in our regulatory approval process if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely or\ncompetent fashion or if we must change service providers. This risk may be greater for our clinical studies and trials conducted outside of the U.S., where it may be more difficult to ensure our studies and trials are conducted in compliance with FDA or foreign regulatory requirements. Any third parties we hire to design or monitor and analyze results of our clinical studies and trials may also provide services to our competitors, which could compromise the performance of their obligations to us. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or for other reasons, our clinical studies or trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may otherwise prove to be unsuccessful, and our development costs will increase. We may not establish or maintain relationships with these third parties on favorable terms, or at all. If we need to enter into replacement arrangements, including because a third-party is not performing in accordance with our expectations, we may not do so without undue delays or considerable expenditures, or at all.\nThe FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies may hold us responsible for any failure of our third-party consultants or contract research organizations. Our monitoring of our third-party consultants or contract research organizations may fail to detect, remedy, or report their failures.\nAny of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur regulatory compliance program cannot guarantee we comply with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the U.S. and in foreign countries covering, for example, the development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing, promotion, import, export and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations. We are also subject to certain financial regulations, including the National Physician Payment Transparency Program in the U.S., which requires collection of information about payments to physicians and teaching hospitals for each calendar year and reporting such information by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. Congress and certain governmental entities, such as the FDA, the Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d), and the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. Although we have a regulatory compliance program, our employees, our consultants or our contractors may not comply with all potentially applicable U.S. federal and state laws and regulations or all potentially applicable foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations about the promotion of our approved or cleared products. Promotion of products cleared under a 510(k) can be particularly risky because 510(k) cleared indications can be vague, and the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may determine that our promotion of a product is \u201coff-label.\u201d This may also occur with products approved under a PMA. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, failing to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, including withdrawal or recall of our products from the market, significant fines, penalties and/or damages, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. In April 2015, we completed a five-year corporate integrity agreement as part of a 2009 settlement of a federal compliance investigation of our company.\nThe continuing development of many of our products depends upon our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians.\nThe research, development, marketing and sale of many of our new and improved products depend upon our maintaining working relationships with physicians. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants, inventors and public speakers. If we cannot maintain our strong working relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. At the same time, the medical device industry\u2019s relationship with physicians is under increasing scrutiny by the OIG and the DOJ. Our failure to comply with requirements governing the industry\u2019s\nrelationships with physicians, including the reporting of certain payments to physicians under the National Physician Payment Transparency Program or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG or the DOJ, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe medical device market in which we participate is largely technology driven. Physicians historically have moved quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. Trademarks also play a role in product differentiation. In order to protect our intellectual property, we may be involved in intellectual property litigation, which is inherently complex, expensive and unpredictable.\nWe hold patents and licenses to use patented technology, and have numerous pending patent applications. Our patents cover numerous inventions, including features of our catheters and other technologies. Our competitors may seek to produce products that include technologies that are not subject to patent protection, which may negatively affect our business.\nThe patents we own and license may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to give us any competitive advantage. Our patents could be challenged as invalid or unenforceable, or circumvented by competitors. Issuing a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability. Any patents for which we have applied may not be granted. Third parties own numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications in the fields in which we manufacture and sell our products.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents our products or technologies may infringe. Challenges raised in, or in response to, patent infringement litigation may cause determinations that our patents or licensed patents are invalid, unenforceable, or otherwise subject to limitations. In such events, third parties may use the discoveries or technologies without paying damages, licensing fees or royalties to us, which could significantly diminish the value of our intellectual property. We could also be adversely affected if our licensors terminate our licenses to use patented technology.\nWe hold trademark applications or registrations relating to our products. Our trademarks may also be challenged as invalid or not distinctive by competitors or third parties. Issuing a trademark registration is not conclusive as to its validity or the right to use such trademark. Third parties own numerous U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications in the fields in which we manufacture and sell our products.\nThe laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. The foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we cannot protect and control unpatented trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary technology, we may suffer competitive harm.\nBesides patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary technology, confidential information and know-how to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position, particularly when patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology are difficult to protect. To protect proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and others. These agreements may not prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property, and may not provide an adequate remedy if unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements occur. Others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary\ninformation licensed to us or that we own, and in such case, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using trade secrets licensed to us or that we own is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Courts outside the U.S. may be less willing to protect trade secrets or unpatented proprietary technology. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nWe have important sole source suppliers and may be unable to replace them if they stop supplying us.\nWe purchase certain components of our CVX-300 laser system and select disposable products from several sole source suppliers. We do not have guaranteed commitments from these suppliers, as we order products through purchase orders placed with these suppliers from time to time. While we believe that we could obtain replacement components from alternative suppliers, we may be unable to do so. Losing any of these suppliers could cause a disruption in our production. Our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunction and environmental factors. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these materials may take significant time, as certain of these suppliers must be approved by regulatory authorities. If we cannot secure on a timely basis sufficient quantities of the materials we depend on to manufacture our laser systems and disposable products, if we encounter delays or contractual or other difficulties in our relationships with these suppliers, or if we cannot find replacement suppliers at an acceptable cost, then manufacturing our laser system and disposable products may be disrupted, which could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf critical components used in manufacturing our CVX-300 excimer laser system or other products become scarce or unavailable, we may incur increased costs and delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could damage our business.\nCertain critical components used in manufacturing our products may be subject to supply shortages, which could subject our business to the risk of price increases and delays in the delivery of our products. If we are unable to continue obtaining components from our suppliers in the quantities we require, on a timely basis, and at acceptable prices, we may not be able to deliver our products on a timely or cost-effective basis to our customers, or at all, which could reduce our product sales, increase our costs, and harm our business. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become unable to supply our required materials, then we may need to find new suppliers, which could take significant time and could disrupt our production. As a result, we could experience significant delays in manufacturing and delivering our products to customers. We cannot assure you we can continue obtaining required materials that are in short supply within the time frames we require at an affordable cost, if at all.\nOur net operating loss carryovers may be limited.\nWe have net operating loss carryovers, or NOLs, including NOLs that we acquired in the AngioScore acquisition, that we may use to offset against taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may limit the NOLs that we may use in any year for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the event of certain changes in ownership of our company. The NOLs of AngioScore or any other company that we may acquire may also be limited due to the ownership change that occurs upon acquisition. Any limitation on our ability to use NOLs could, depending on the extent of such limitation, result in higher U.S. federal income taxes being paid (and therefore a reduction in cash) during any year in which we have taxable income than if such NOLs were available as an offset against such income for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes.\nThe stated value of long-lived and intangible assets may become impaired and result in an impairment charge.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $247.0 million of intangible assets and goodwill, $209.4 million of which related to the AngioScore acquisition. In addition, if in the future we acquire additional businesses or technologies, a substantial portion of the value of such assets may be recorded as intangible assets or goodwill. The carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill are affected whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable. Such events or changes might include a significant decline in market share, a significant decline in revenue, a significant increase in losses or decrease in profits, rapid changes in technology, failure to achieve the benefits of capacity increases and utilization, significant litigation arising out of an acquisition or other matters. Adverse events or changes in circumstances may affect the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be derived from intangible assets. If at any time we determine that an impairment has occurred, we will be required to reflect the impaired value as a charge, resulting in a reduction in earnings in the period such impairment is identified and a corresponding reduction in our net asset value. In 2016, there was no intangible asset impairment. In 2015, we recorded an intangible asset impairment of $2.5 million to record a partial impairment of the in-process research and development intangible assets acquired as part of the AngioScore acquisition. For more information, refer to Note 2, \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this annual report. In 2014, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $4.1 million related to the intangible assets acquired as part of our product acquisition from Upstream Peripheral Technologies Ltd. (\u201cUpstream\u201d) in January 2013, based on their updated fair value using revised cash flow assumptions related to those assets. The potential recognition of impairment in the carrying value of our long-lived assets, if any, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our component suppliers may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing processes, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we must register with the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, and we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, for compliance with certain good manufacturing practices, including design controls, product validation and verification, in process testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies. Our component suppliers are also required to meet certain standards applicable to their manufacturing processes.\nWe cannot assure you that we or our component suppliers comply or can continue to comply with all regulatory requirements. The failure by us or one of our component suppliers to achieve or maintain compliance with these requirements or quality standards may disrupt our ability to supply products sufficient to meet demand until compliance is achieved or, with a component supplier, until a new supplier has been identified and evaluated. Our or our component supplier\u2019s failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause sanctions to be imposed on us, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals or clearances, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, which could harm our business. We cannot assure you that if we need to engage new suppliers to satisfy our business requirements, we can locate new suppliers in compliance with regulatory requirements. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the European Union, we must maintain certain International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, certifications to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies, including the British Standards Institution, to obtain and maintain these certifications. If we fail these inspections or fail to meet these regulatory standards, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nHealthcare cost containment pressures and legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive coverage and reimbursement practices of third-party payers could decrease the demand for our products, the prices that customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur products are purchased principally by hospitals and stand-alone peripheral intervention practices, which typically bill various third-party payers, including governmental programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for our products and services from government and private third-party payers is critical to our success. The availability of coverage and reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay.\nReimbursement varies from country to country, state to state and plan to plan and can significantly influence the acceptance of new products and services. Certain private third-party payers may view some procedures using our products as experimental and may not provide coverage. Third-party payers may not cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future, or payment rates may not be adequate, or both. Further, the adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers is also related to billing codes to describe procedures performed using our products. Hospitals and physicians use several billing codes to bill for such procedures. Third-party payers may not continue to recognize the billing codes available for use by our customers.\nReimbursement rates are unpredictable, and we cannot project how our business may be affected by future legislative and regulatory developments. Future legislation or regulation, or changing payment methodologies, may have a material adverse effect on our business, and reimbursement may not be adequate for all customers. From time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment amounts are updated and revised by third-party payers. Because the cost of our products generally is recovered by the healthcare provider as part of the payment for performing a procedure and not separately reimbursed, these updates could directly impact the demand for our products. For example, in July 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, proposed reimbursement changes that would have decreased reimbursement for procedures in an office-based facility. Although CMS chose not to implement those changes in 2013, we cannot assure you that CMS will not take similar actions in the future.\nThe Medicare program is subjected to annual updates to physician payments. This is performed using a prescribed statutory formula. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, signed into law in April 2014, provided for a 0.5% update from 2013 payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2014 and a 0% update from January 1 until April 1, 2015. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, signed into law in April 2015, lays out annual updates to payments for at least the next 10 years: payment rates will be updated by 0.5% for July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, and then annually through 2019; the law then provides a 0% update from 2020 through 2025. Beginning in 2026, payment rates will be updated either by 0.25% annually for providers participating in non-alternative payment models or by 0.75% annually for providers participating in alternative payment models. In addition, the Medicare physician fee schedule has been adopted by some private payers into their plan specific physician payment schedule. We cannot predict how pending and future healthcare legislation will impact our business. Any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our products or lowers reimbursement for procedures using our devices could materially affect our business.\nAfter we develop new products or seek to market our products for new approved or cleared indications, we may find limited demand for the product unless government and private third-party payers provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Even with reimbursement approval and coverage by government and private payers, providers submitting reimbursement claims may face delay in payment if there is confusion by providers regarding the appropriate codes to use in seeking reimbursement. Such delays may create an unfavorable impression within the marketplace regarding the level of reimbursement or coverage available for our products.\nDemand for our products or new approved indications for our existing products may fluctuate over time if federal or state legislative or administrative policy changes affect coverage or reimbursement levels for our products or the services related to our products. In the U.S., there have been and we expect there will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, such as the potential repeal of the PPACA, some of which could significantly affect our business. It is uncertain what impact the newly elected U.S. presidential administration will have on health care spending including a campaign promise to repeal the PPACA. If enacted and implemented, any measures to restrict health care spending could result in decreased revenue from our products and decreased potential returns from our research and development initiatives. Other legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. or international reimbursement systems in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws and regulations and equivalent local laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and, if we cannot fully comply with such laws, could face substantial penalties.\nVarious broad federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws may directly or indirectly affect our operations. Such laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in the U.S. and related state and international anti-kickback laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, purchasing, leasing or ordering of, or arranging for or recommending the furnishing, purchasing, leasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person may be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. The federal Stark law and self-referral prohibitions under analogous state laws restrict referrals by physicians and, sometimes, other healthcare providers, practitioners and professionals, to entities with which they have indirect or direct financial relationships for furnishing of designated health services. The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. HIPAA created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. These healthcare fraud and abuse laws are subject to evolving interpretations by various federal and state enforcement and regulatory authorities. Under current interpretations of the federal False Claims Act and certain similar state laws, some of these laws also may be subject to enforcement in a qui tam lawsuit brought by a private party \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d with or without the intervention of the government. Whistleblowers are entitled to be paid a portion of the judgment or settlement amount and therefore have financial incentives to file these cases.\nIf our operations, including our laser system placement and disposable products sales and marketing programs, clinical research or consulting arrangements with physicians, are found to violate these laws and are not protected under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor provision, we, our officers or our employees may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties, including large monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare and other federal healthcare program participation. Exclusion would preclude our products from use in treatment of Medicare or other federal healthcare program patients and could negatively impact sales of our products. If federal or state investigations or enforcement actions occur, our business and financial condition would be harmed.\nThere has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. The PPACA imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device and drug manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Medical device and drug manufacturers are also required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members\nduring the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information or the submission of incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties. Manufacturers must submit reports providing payment data for a calendar year by the 90th day of the subsequent calendar year. Some states, including California, Massachusetts and Vermont, have enacted statutes with various requirements, such as implementation of compliance programs, and the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more requirements. If we are investigated or found to have violated these laws, we may incur significant expenses, including fines and penalties.\nIn addition, HIPAA and other federal and state data privacy and security laws and equivalent local laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information. The costs of complying with privacy and security-related legal and regulatory requirements may be burdensome, and if we do not comply with existing or new federal or state laws and regulations related to patient health information, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions and any resulting liability could adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approvals in other countries for our products, we cannot market our products in those countries, which could harm our business.\nThe requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and manufacturing and marketing of our products, new products, or additional indications for our existing products outside the U.S. vary widely from country to country. Foreign approvals may take longer to obtain than FDA approvals and can require additional testing and different clinical trial designs. Foreign regulatory approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval processes. Some foreign regulatory agencies also must approve the reimbursement policies related to specific products. We have had difficulties in the past in obtaining reimbursement approvals for our products in Europe and are seeking regulatory and reimbursement approval for certain of our products in Japan and other countries. We cannot assure you that we will receive this approval or that revenue in Japan and other countries will increase if we receive it. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively influence the regulatory process in others. We may not file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to market our existing products in any foreign country. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain required approvals in any foreign country, we cannot sell our products in that country and our ability to generate revenue could be materially adversely affected.\nThere are risks from having international operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our revenue from international operations represented 17% of consolidated revenue. Changes in international political or economic conditions, war or other conflicts, currency exchange rates, foreign laws regulating the approval and sales of medical devices, foreign tax laws, export/import licenses or tariffs, other trade regulations or intellectual property protection could adversely affect our ability to market our products outside the U.S. Our international operations subject us to the extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material adverse impact on our business. To the extent we expand our international operations, we expect our sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies to expand, therefore increasing the risk fluctuations in currency exchange rates will adversely affect us. We do not hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in reduced consolidated revenue or increased operating expenses.\nWe use both a direct sales organization and distributors for sales of our products throughout most of the countries that comprise our international operations. The international sales and marketing efforts could fail to attain long-term success.\nWe face additional credit and compliance risks related to our international sales using foreign distributors.\nWe may not be able to collect all of the funds owed to us by our foreign distributors. Some foreign distributors may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which may hinder our collection of accounts receivable. We regularly review the collectability and creditworthiness of our foreign distributors when determining the payment terms for such distributors. If our uncollectible accounts exceed our expectations, this could adversely impact our operating results. In addition, failure by our foreign distributors to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws, insurance requirements, or other contract terms could have a negative impact on our business. Failure to manage the risks related to our foreign distributors could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nThe consequences of the 2016 U.K. \u201cBrexit\u201d vote may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) held a referendum in which voters approved withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nIf our manufacturing operations are interrupted, our results may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to manufacture our products may be adversely affected by factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities. If an interruption in manufacturing occurs, we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand. If the interruption results from a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may be required to recall affected products and may experience delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to a need to obtain regulatory approvals. We may suffer loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAn interruption in or breach of security of our information or manufacturing systems, including the occurrence of a cyber incident or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, may cause a loss of business or damage to our reputation.\nWe rely on communications, information and manufacturing systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption, or cyber incident that impacts these systems could cause failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management or product manufacturing. A cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to information systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or cyber incidents could cause a loss of customer business or reputation and have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProduct liability and other claims against us may reduce demand for our products or result in substantial damages.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability for risks that may arise from the clinical testing of our unapproved or cleared new products, the clinical testing of expanded indications for existing products, the use of our products by physicians and the manufacture and sale of any approved or cleared products. An individual may bring a\nproduct liability claim against us, including frivolous lawsuits, if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. We maintain product liability insurance for $25 million per occurrence with an annual aggregate maximum of $25 million. We cannot assure, however, that product liability claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance coverage limits will continue to be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our insurers may also claim that certain claims are not within the scope of our product liability insurance. A product liability claim, recall, or other claim regarding uninsured liabilities or for amounts over insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any product liability claim or series of claims or class actions brought against us, with or without merit, could result in:\n\u2022\nliabilities that substantially exceed our insurance levels, which we would then be required to pay from other sources, if available;\n\u2022\nan increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to renew or obtain product liability insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers or subjects;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation and the reputation of our products;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications;\n\u2022\nlitigation costs; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from managing our business.\nPatients treated with our products often are seriously ill or have pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (\u201cICD\u201d) leads embedded and surrounded by scar tissue within their chest. Patients treated with our products may suffer from severe infection, PAD, coronary artery disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other problematic conditions. During procedures or the clinical follow-up subsequent to procedures involving the use of our products, serious adverse events may occur and some patients may die. Serious adverse events or patient deaths involving the use of our products may subject us to product liability litigation, product recalls or other regulatory enforcement actions or limit our ability to grow our revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nConsumers, healthcare providers or others selling our products may make claims against us. We may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. We rely on the expertise of physicians, nurses and other associated medical personnel to perform the medical procedures and related processes relating to our products. If these medical personnel are not properly trained or are negligent in using our products, the therapeutic effect of our products may be diminished or the patient may suffer injury or death, which may subject us to liability. An injury or death resulting from the activities of our suppliers may serve as a basis for a claim against us.\nWe maintain policies and procedures and require training designed to educate our employees that they should not promote our products in an off-label promotion fashion. However, we cannot prevent a physician from using our products for any off-label applications. If injury to a patient results from such use, we may become involved in a product liability suit, which may be expensive to defend. Even if we do not become involved in a suit, quality or safety issues could cause reputational harm, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of devices, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing approvals or clearances.\nAlthough there is federal preemption for medical devices approved by the FDA under a PMA application that in some situations provides a shield against state tort product liability claims, Supreme Court decisions or federal legislation could reverse the exemption. If this preemption is removed, product liability claims may increase. Federal preemption for medical devices cleared through the 510(k) process is limited, if it exists at all.\nEnvironmental and health safety laws may result in liabilities, expenses and restrictions on our operations.\nFederal, state, local and foreign laws regarding environmental protection, hazardous substances and human health and safety may adversely affect our business. Using hazardous substances in our operations exposes us to the risk of accidental injury, contamination or other liability from the use, storage, importation, handling, or disposal of hazardous materials. If our or our suppliers\u2019 operations result in the contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and fines, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We maintain insurance for certain environmental risks, subject to substantial deductibles; however, we cannot assure you we can continue to maintain this insurance in the future at an acceptable cost or at all. Future changes to environmental and health and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expenses or restrict our operations.\nWe depend on attracting, retaining and developing key management, clinical, scientific and sales and marketing personnel, and losing these personnel could impair the development and sales of our products.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly qualified management, clinical, scientific and sales and marketing personnel. Except for our chief executive officer, we do not have employment agreements with our employees. Our employees are employed \u201cat will,\u201d and each employee can terminate his or her employment with us at any time. As a condition of employment, our employees sign a confidentiality and trade secrets agreement that precludes them, upon termination of their employment, from disclosing any proprietary information, recruiting our employees or working for a competitor. We also have agreements with some of our officers that provide for the payment of either two years\u2019 salary plus bonus or one year\u2019s salary plus bonus if the officer\u2019s employment ends in certain circumstances. The agreements also prohibit the officer from competing with us and soliciting our employees and customers if termination of employment occurs. The enforceability of these agreements depends on the circumstances at the time of separation, and the agreements may be difficult to enforce. We do not carry key person insurance covering members of senior management. The competition for qualified personnel in the medical device industry is intense. We will need to hire additional personnel as we continue to expand our development activities and drive sales of our products. We may not attract, retain and develop quality personnel on acceptable terms due to the competition for such personnel.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry companies, including healthcare systems, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices that incorporate components produced by us. If we reduce our prices because of consolidation in the healthcare industry, our revenue would decrease and our consolidated earnings, financial condition, or cash flows would suffer.\nIf we make additional acquisitions, we could incur significant costs and encounter difficulties that harm our business.\nWe may acquire companies, products, or technologies in the future. If we engage in such acquisitions, we may incur significant transaction and integration costs and have difficulty integrating the acquired personnel, operations, products or technologies or otherwise realizing synergies or other benefits from the acquisitions. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees, loss of key customers, loss of key vendors, decreases in revenue and increases in operating costs, as well as the disruption of our business. Acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share, disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses, subject us to liabilities and increase our risk of litigation, all of which could harm our business. If we use cash to acquire companies, products or technologies, it may divert resources otherwise available for other purposes or\nincrease our debt. If we use our common stock to acquire companies, products or technologies, we may experience a change of control or our stockholders may experience substantial dilution or both.\nA U.S. and global economic downturn could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets. Over the past several years, the global credit and capital markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption. The strength of the U.S. and global economy is uncertain, and the U.S. may experience slowed growth or another recession. Turbulence in the financial markets and general economic uncertainties may make it more difficult and more expensive for hospitals and health systems to obtain credit, which would contribute to pressures on our operating margin, resulting from rising supply costs, reduced investment income and philanthropic giving, increased interest expense, reimbursement pressure, reduced elective healthcare spending and uncompensated care. In such circumstances, we expect many of our customers would continue to scrutinize costs, trim budgets and look for opportunities to further reduce or slow spending.\nThe potential decline in federal and state revenues that may result from such conditions may create additional pressures to contain or reduce reimbursements for our products from Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored programs. Increasing job losses or slow improvement in the unemployment rate in the U.S. has and may continue to result in a smaller percentage of patients being covered by an employer group health plan and a larger percentage being covered by lower paying Medicare, Medicaid and health plans offered through PPACA exchanges.\nFurther, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar or other economic event may adversely affect the results of our international operations when those results are translated into U.S. dollars. Disruptions in the credit markets could impede our access to capital, which could further adversely affect us if we cannot maintain our current credit ratings. If we cannot obtain financing, we may need to defer capital expenditures or seek other sources of liquidity, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. All of these factors related to the global economic situation, which are beyond our control, could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Debt\nWe may not have the cash necessary to satisfy our cash obligations under our outstanding 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2034, our term loan facility or our revolving loan facility, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to satisfy our cash obligations under the notes, the term loan facility or the revolving loan facility.\nWe incurred $230 million in aggregate principal amount of senior indebtedness in June 2014 when we issued our 2.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2034, or the Notes. The Notes bear cash interest payable semiannually at a rate of 2.625% per year and are convertible at any time, initially at a price of approximately $31.35 per share. The conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events including a fundamental change as defined in the indenture agreement. The Notes mature on June 1, 2034, unless earlier converted, redeemed by us, or repurchased in accordance with terms of the Notes. On each of June 5, 2021, June 5, 2024 and June 5, 2029 and upon a fundamental change, the holders may require us to repurchase some or all of their Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the relevant repurchase date. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations and, in such circumstances, may not be able to arrange the necessary financing to satisfy such cash obligations on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our ability to satisfy such cash obligations may be limited by applicable law or the terms of other instruments governing our indebtedness, including debt that we may incur in the future that is secured or senior in right of payment to the Notes. Our failure to pay such cash\nobligations would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes, which in turn could constitute an event of default under any of our outstanding indebtedness, thereby resulting in the acceleration of such indebtedness (including the Notes) and required prepayment and further restrict our ability to satisfy such cash obligations.\nOn December 7, 2015, we entered into a term credit and security agreement and a revolving credit and security agreement. The term credit and security agreement provides for a five-year $60 million term loan facility and the revolving credit and security agreement provides for a five-year $50 million revolving loan facility. Our obligations under these agreements are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Interest-only payments are due during the first 24 months of the term loan facility, with principal payments beginning thereafter in equal monthly installments until maturity, provided that we may postpone making principal payments for an additional 12 months if certain conditions are met and the lenders and its agent agree to such extension. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations and, in such circumstances, may not be able to arrange the necessary financing to satisfy such cash obligations on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our ability to satisfy such cash obligations may be limited by applicable law or the terms of other instruments governing our indebtedness, including debt that we may incur in the future that is senior in right of payment to the term loan facility or revolving loan facility. Our failure to pay such cash obligations would constitute an event of default under the term credit and security agreement and the revolving credit and security agreement, which in turn could constitute an event of default under any of our outstanding indebtedness (including the Notes), thereby resulting in the acceleration of such indebtedness and required prepayment and further restricting our ability to satisfy such cash obligations.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, the term loan facility and the revolving loan facility, depends on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur term loan facility and revolving loan facility contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial metrics and restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility. A breach of those covenants may cause us to be in default under the facilities and our other indebtedness, and our lenders could foreclose on our assets.\nThe term credit and security agreement and revolving credit and security agreement require us to maintain minimum cash and cash equivalents of not less than $10 million and achieve net revenues in excess of certain specified thresholds. A failure to increase our revenue levels or an inability to control costs or capital expenditures could negatively impact our ability to meet these financial covenants. If we breach such covenants or any of the restrictive covenants described below, the lenders could either refuse to lend funds to us under the revolving loan facility or accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility and revolving loan facility. We may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness upon a default. If we are unable to repay the indebtedness, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or collection proceedings with respect to our assets.\nThe term credit and security agreement and revolving credit and security agreement also contain certain restrictive covenants that limit and in some circumstances prohibit, our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, sell, lease or transfer our assets, pay dividends on our common stock, make capital expenditures and investments, guarantee debt or obligations, create liens, repurchase our common stock, enter into transactions with our affiliates and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors.\nOur debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service and other obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $314.7 million, consisting of $230.0 million principal amount of Notes, $60.0 million outstanding under our term loan facility and $24.7 million outstanding under our revolving loan facility. Our debt could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:\n\u2022\ndue to financial and other covenants contained in the agreements, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our debt and our contractual and commercial commitments and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments, or general corporate purposes, which may limit the ability to execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy; and\n\u2022\nresult in higher interest expense if interest rates increase and we have outstanding floating rate borrowings.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock, similar to other medical device companies, has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile. The trading price of our stock varied from a low of $11.42 to a high of $25.39 in 2016. The following factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and the operating results of competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products or acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials or studies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation;\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding patents or proprietary rights, including assertions our patents are invalid or our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\npublic concern regarding the safety of products developed by us or others;\n\u2022\nthe initiation or cessation in coverage of our common stock, or changes in estimates or recommendations concerning us or our common stock, by securities analysts and results that differ from analysts\u2019 estimates;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\npast or future management changes;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nadverse developments in any government inquiry or investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of our financing future operations through additional issuances of equity securities, which may cause dilution to existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\nany of the other events described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Following the decrease in our stock price in July 2015, we became the target of securities litigation. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could cost substantial amounts and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business and could require us to make substantial payments to settle those proceedings or satisfy any judgments that may be reached against us.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business and us. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about our business or us. If one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports about our company, we could lose visibility in the financial market, which could cause our stock price to decline. Further, securities or industry analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and intend to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Capital appreciation of our common stock will be the sole source of gain on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions, conversion of the Notes or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings and could affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 61.5 million shares of our common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for issuance under our option and compensation plans or under other convertible or derivative instruments. We may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. We may pursue acquisitions of other companies and may issue shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Any shares of our common stock issued in connection with equity or convertible debt offerings, acquisitions, the conversion of the Notes, the exercise of stock options or restricted stock units, or otherwise may involve substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nProtections against unsolicited takeovers in our charter and bylaws may reduce or eliminate our stockholders\u2019 ability to resell their shares at a premium over market price.\nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions relating to issuance of preferred stock, special meetings of stockholders and advance notification procedures for stockholder proposals that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing an unsolicited change in the control of our company. Our stockholders elect our board of directors for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing all directors at each annual meeting and may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, or Section 203, which in general and subject to exceptions, prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d (as defined in Section 203) with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in Section 203) for a period of three years after the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met. Section 203 may discourage, delay, or prevent an acquisition of our company even at a price our stockholders may find attractive.", "PERMNO": 77271, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "SPNC"}
