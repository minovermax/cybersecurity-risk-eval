{"cik": "1479750", "company": "Capital Bank Financial Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Banking Operations\nOur acquisition history may not be indicative of our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nOur prior acquisitions should be viewed in the context of the opportunities available to us at that time as a result of the confluence of our access to capital at a time when market dislocations of historical proportions resulted in attractive asset acquisition opportunities. We may prove to be unable to execute our growth strategy, which could impact our future earnings, reputation and results of operations. We have completed the process of integrating seven of the acquired banking platforms into a single unified operating platform (the Failed Banks, TIB Financial, Capital Bank Corp., Green Bankshares and Southern Community Financial), with our last acquisition closing on October 1, 2012.\nA decline in general business and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions, including factors such as the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income and consumer spending. While the national economy and certain regions have improved since the recent financial crisis and economic recession, we continue to operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. The risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth. A return or continuation of recessionary conditions or negative events in the housing markets, including significant and continuing home price reductions and increased delinquencies and foreclosures, will likely result in poor performance of mortgage and construction loans and asset write-downs. In addition, poor economic conditions, including continued high unemployment in the United States and the European sovereign debt crisis, have contributed to increased volatility in the financial and capital markets and diminished expectations for the U.S. economy. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve, and these conditions could worsen. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and saving habits. All of these negative conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans or our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is also significantly affected by fiscal, monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Changes in any of these policies including U.S. government spending cuts, are beyond our control, difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe geographic concentration of our markets in the southeastern region of the United States makes our business highly susceptible to downturns in the local economies and depressed banking markets, which could be detrimental to our financial condition.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, we are a regional banking franchise concentrated in the southeastern region of the United States. We operate branches located in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. As of December 31, 2014, 37% of our loans were in North Carolina, 30% were in Florida, 22% were in Tennessee, and 11% were in South Carolina. Deterioration in local economic conditions in the loan market or in the residential, commercial or industrial real estate market could have a material adverse effect on the quality of our portfolio, the demand for our products and services, the ability of borrowers to timely repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. In addition, if the population or income growth in the region is slower than projected, income levels, deposits and real estate development could be adversely affected and could result in the curtailment of our expansion, growth and profitability. If any of these developments were to result in losses that materially and adversely affected Capital Bank\u2019s capital, we and Capital Bank might be subject to regulatory restrictions on operations and growth and to a requirement to raise additional capital.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. In particular, we rely on the leadership and experience in the banking industry of our Chief Executive Officer R. Eugene Taylor. Mr. Taylor is the former Vice Chairman of Bank of America and has extensive experience executing and overseeing bank acquisitions. The loss of service of Mr. Taylor or one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although Messrs. Taylor, Marshall, Singletary and Posner have each entered into an employment agreement with us, it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur loss sharing agreements impose restrictions on the operation of our business; failure to comply with the terms of our loss sharing agreements with the FDIC or other regulatory agreements or orders may result in significant losses or regulatory sanctions, and we are exposed to unrecoverable losses on the Failed Banks\u2019 assets that we acquired.\nIn July 2010, we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed all of the deposits and certain other liabilities of the Failed Banks in FDIC-assisted transactions, and a material portion of our revenue is derived from such assets. Certain of the purchased assets are covered by the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which provide that the FDIC will bear 80% of losses on the covered loan assets and other real estate owned we acquired in our acquisition of the Failed Banks within the loss sharing agreement period, which expires after 5 years for covered commercial loans and 10 years for covered residential loans. We are subject to audit by the FDIC at its discretion to ensure we are in compliance with the terms of these agreements. We may experience difficulties in complying with the requirements of the loss sharing agreements, the terms of which are extensive and failure to comply with any of the terms could result in a specific asset or group of assets losing their loss sharing coverage.\nThe FDIC has the right to refuse or delay payment partially or in full for such loan losses if we fail to comply with the terms of the loss sharing agreements, which are extensive. Additionally, the loss sharing agreements are limited in duration. Therefore, any losses that we experience after the terms of the loss sharing agreements have ended will not be recoverable from the FDIC and would negatively impact our net income.\nOur loss sharing agreements also impose limitations on how we manage loans covered by loss sharing. For example, under the loss sharing agreements, we are not permitted to sell a covered loan even if in the ordinary course of our business we determine that taking such action would be advantageous for us. These restrictions could impair our ability to manage problem loans and extend the amount of time that such loans remain on our balance sheet and could negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition to the loss sharing agreements, in August 2010, Capital Bank entered into an Operating Agreement with the OCC (which we refer to as the \u201cOCC Operating Agreement\u201d), in connection with our acquisition of the Failed Banks. Capital Bank (and, with respect to certain provisions, the Company) is also subject to an Order of the FDIC, dated July 16, 2010 and amended on December 21, 2011 (which we refer to as the \u201cFDIC Order\u201d) issued in connection with the FDIC\u2019s approval of our deposit insurance applications for the Failed Banks. The OCC Operating Agreement requires that Capital Bank maintain various financial and capital ratios and the OCC Operating Agreement and the FDIC Order require prior regulatory notice and consent to take certain actions in connection with operating the business and may restrict Capital Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us and to make changes to its capital structure. A failure by us or Capital Bank to comply with the requirements of the OCC Operating Agreement or the FDIC Order could subject us to regulatory sanctions; and failure to comply, or the objection, or imposition of additional conditions, by the OCC or the FDIC, in connection with any materials or information submitted thereunder, could prevent us from executing our business strategy and negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAny requested or required changes in how we determine the impact of loss share accounting on our financial information could have a material adverse effect on our reported results.\nA material portion of our financial results is based on loss share accounting, which is subject to assumptions and judgments made by us and the regulatory agencies to which we report such information. Loss share accounting is a complex accounting methodology.\nIf these assumptions are incorrect or the regulatory agencies to whom we report require that we change or modify our assumptions, such change or modification could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operations or our previously reported results. As such, any financial information generated through the use of loss share accounting is subject to modification or change. Any significant modification or change in such information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our previously reported results.\nOur financial information reflects the application of the acquisition method of accounting. Any change in the assumptions used in such methodology could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs a result of our recent acquisitions, our financial results are heavily influenced by the application of the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires management to make assumptions regarding the assets purchased and liabilities assumed to determine their fair market value. Our interest income, interest expense and net interest margin (which were equal to $270.8 million, $24.7 million and 4.21%, respectively, in 2014) reflect the impact of accretion of the fair value adjustments made to the carrying amounts of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and our non-interest income (which totaled $43.8 million in 2014) for periods subsequent to the acquisitions includes the effects of discount accretion and amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset. In addition, the balances of non-performing assets were significantly reduced by the adjustments to fair value recorded in conjunction with the relevant acquisition. If our assumptions are incorrect or the regulatory agencies to whom we report require that we change or modify our assumptions, such change or modification could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or our previously reported results.\nOur business is highly susceptible to credit risk.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral (if any) securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. The risks inherent in making any loan include risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral. The credit standards, procedures and policies that we have established for borrowers may not prevent the incurrence of substantial credit losses.\nAlthough we have not restructured many of our new or non-purchased credit impaired (\u201cnon-PCI\u201d) loans for borrowers in financial difficulty, in the future, we may restructure more originated or acquired loans if we believe the borrowers have a viable business plan to fully pay off all obligations. However, for our originated loans, if interest rates or other terms are modified upon extension of credit or if terms of an existing loan are renewed in such a situation and a concession is granted, we may be required to classify such action as a troubled debt restructuring (which we refer to as a \u201cTDR\u201d). We classify loans as TDRs when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to their financial difficulty. Generally, these loans are restructured to provide the borrower additional time to execute its business plan. With respect to restructured loans, we may grant concessions by (1) reducing of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or (2) extending the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. In situations where a TDR is unsuccessful and the borrower is unable to satisfy the terms of the restructured agreement, the loan would be placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the underlying collateral value.\nThe overall ratio of non-performing loans to total loans declined from 11.12% as of December 31, 2010 to 2.6% as of December 31, 2014. This decline is due primarily to resolution of problem loans coupled with the increased proportion of loans originated by us under our credit policies and underwriting standards and the lower relative proportion of non-performing loans we acquired through our acquisitions. Non-performing loans include loans classified as non-accrual as well as loans which may be contractually past due 90 or more days but are still accruing interest either because they are well secured and in the process of collection or because they are accounted for according to accounting guidance for acquired impaired loans. Criticized and classified loans, which management seeks to resolve, totaled $349.2 million as of December 31, 2014. If management is unable to effectively resolve these loans, they could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nRecent economic and market developments and the potential for continued economic disruption present considerable risks to us and it is difficult to determine the depth and duration of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may impact our business in general. Any failure to manage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our business and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 70% of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A weakening of the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, weakness in the secondary market for residential lending could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Significant disruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans have limited the market for, and liquidity of, most mortgage loans other than conforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans. The effects of ongoing mortgage market challenges and uncertainty, including uncertainty with respect to U.S. monetary policy, could result in price reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans held, any future mortgage loan originations and gains on sale of mortgage loans. Declines in real estate values and home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses or other factors could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and charge-offs in future periods, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur construction and land development loans are based upon estimates of costs and the values of the complete projects.\nWhile we focus on originating loans other than non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, our portfolio includes construction and land development loans (which we refer to as \u201cC&D loans\u201d) extended to builders and developers, primarily for the construction and/or development of properties. These loans have been extended on a presold and speculative basis and they include loans for both residential and commercial purposes.\nIn general, C&D lending involves additional risks because of the inherent difficulty in estimating a property\u2019s value both before and at completion of the project. Construction costs may exceed original estimates as a result of increased materials, labor or other costs. In addition, because of current uncertainties in the residential and commercial real estate markets, property values have become more difficult to determine than they have been historically. The repayment of construction and land acquisition and development loans is often dependent, in part, on the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property. These loans also require ongoing monitoring. In addition, speculative construction loans to a residential builder are often associated with homes that are not presold and, thus, pose a greater potential risk than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences. Slowing housing sales could cause an increase in non-performing loans as well as an increase in delinquencies.\nAs of December 31, 2014, C&D loans totaled $269.4 million (or 5.4% of our total loan portfolio), of which $68.7 million was for construction and/or development of residential properties and $200.8 million was for construction/development of commercial properties. As of December 31, 2014, non-performing C&D loans not covered under FDIC loss share agreements totaled $25.7 million. There were $4.0 million non-performing C&D loans covered under FDIC loss share agreements.\nOur non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans may be dependent on factors outside the control of our borrowers.\nWhile we focus on originating loans other than non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, in the acquisitions we acquired non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. This may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate. In such cases, we may be compelled to modify the terms of the loan or engage in other potentially expensive work-out techniques. If we foreclose on a non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than a 1-4 family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, charge-offs on non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $798.6 million (or 16.0% of our total loan portfolio). As of December 31, 2014, non-performing non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans not covered under FDIC loss share agreements totaled $15.5 million. There were $1.6 million non-performing non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans covered under FDIC loss share agreements.\nRepayment of our commercial business loans is dependent on the cash flows of borrowers, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.\nOur business plan focuses on originating different types of commercial business loans. We classify types of commercial loans offered as owner-occupied term real estate loans, business lines of credit and term equipment financing. Commercial business lending involves risks that are different from those associated with non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending. Our commercial business loans are primarily underwritten based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral, including real estate. The borrowers\u2019 cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Some of our commercial business loans are collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, and the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our commercial business loans totaled $2.1 billion (or 42.4% of our total loan portfolio). Of this amount, $1.0 billion was secured by owner-occupied real estate and $1.1 billion was secured by business assets. As of December 31, 2014, non-performing commercial business loans covered under FDIC loss share agreements totaled $1.3 million and non-performing commercial business loans not covered under FDIC loss share agreements totaled $42.5 million.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses and fair value adjustments may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses for loans that we originate.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\ncash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;\n\u2022\nthe changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of a collateralized loan;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the loan;\n\u2022\nthe discount on the loan at the time of acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe credit history of a particular borrower; and\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and industry conditions.\nNon-performing loans covered under loss share agreements with the FDIC totaled $13.5 million, and non-performing loans not covered under loss share agreements with the FDIC totaled $117.2 million as of December 31, 2014. We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses with respect to loans we originate, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense, which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management team through periodic reviews. As of December 31, 2014, the allowance for loans covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC was $9.8 million, and the allowance for loans not covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC was $40.4 million. As of December 31, 2014, the ratio of our allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC was 72.8%, and the ratio of our allowance for loan and lease losses to non-performing loans not covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC was 34.5%.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting to our completed acquisitions impacted our allowance for loan and lease losses. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all loans were recorded in our financial statements at their fair value at the time of their acquisition and the related allowance for loan and lease loss was eliminated because the fair value at the time was determined by the net present value of the expected cash flows taking into consideration estimated credit quality. We may in the future determine that our estimates of fair value are too high, in which case we would provide for additional loan losses associated with the acquired loans. As of December 31, 2014, the allowance for loan and lease losses on purchased credit impaired (\u201cPCI\u201d) loan pools totaled $28.9 million, of which $9.6 million was related to loan pools covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC and $19.3 million was related to loan pools not covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans that we originate, identification of additional problem loans originated by us and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. If real estate values decline, we expect that we will experience increased credit losses, particularly with respect to construction, land development and land loans. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for probable loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about this estimate and our methodology.\nWe continue to hold and acquire other real estate, which has led to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.\nWe foreclose on and take title to the real estate serving as collateral for many of our loans as part of our business. Real estate owned by us and not used in the ordinary course of its operations is referred to as \u201cother real estate owned\u201d or \u201cOREO\u201d property. At December 31, 2014, we had $77.6 million of OREO. OREO balances have led to greater expenses as we incur costs to manage and dispose of the properties. We expect that our earnings will continue to be negatively affected by various expenses associated with OREO, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with assets that are tied up in OREO. Any decrease in real estate market prices may lead to additional OREO write-downs, with a corresponding expense in our statement of operations. We evaluate OREO properties periodically and write down the carrying value of the properties if the results of our evaluation require it. The expenses associated with OREO and any further property write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent laws might restrict or delay our ability to foreclose and collect payments for single family residential loans.\nRecent laws delay the initiation or completion of foreclosure proceedings on specified types of residential mortgage loans (some for a limited period of time), or otherwise limit the ability of residential loan servicers to take actions that may be essential to preserve the value of the mortgage loans. Any such limitations are likely to cause delayed or reduced collections from mortgagors and generally increased servicing costs. As a servicer of mortgage loans, any restriction on our ability to foreclose on a loan, any requirement that we forgo a portion of the amount otherwise due on a loan or any requirement that we modify any original loan terms will in some instances require us to advance principal, interest, tax and insurance payments, which may negatively impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition, for the single family residential loans covered by the loss sharing agreements, we cannot collect loss share payments until we liquidate the properties securing those loans. These loss share payments could be delayed by an extended foreclosure process, including delays resulting from a court backlog, local or national foreclosure moratoriums or other delays, and these delays could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLike other financial services institutions, our asset and liability structures are monetary in nature. Such structures are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in interest rates, which can impact the value of financial instruments held by us.\nLike other financial services institutions, we have asset and liability structures that are essentially monetary in nature and are directly affected by many factors, including domestic and international economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, legislation and regulation affecting the national and international business and financial communities, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation, currency values, market conditions, the availability and cost of short-term or long-term funding and capital, the credit capacity or perceived creditworthiness of customers and counterparties and the level and volatility of trading markets. Such factors can impact customers and counterparties of a financial services institution and may impact the value of financial instruments held by a financial services institution.\nOur earnings and cash flows largely depend upon the level of our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently and at different times to market interest rate changes, changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, and because the magnitude of repricing of interest earning assets is often greater than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.\nAdditionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates, while a decrease in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits.\nAccordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets, loan origination volume, loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and our overall results. Changes in interest rates may also have a significant impact on any future mortgage loan origination revenues. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the demand for mortgage loans and interest rates. Mortgage origination volume and revenues usually decline during periods of rising or high interest rates and increase during periods of declining or low interest rates. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of a significant percentage of the assets on our balance sheet. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. We cannot predict the nature and timing of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies or other changes in monetary policies and economic conditions, which could negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe have benefited in recent periods from a favorable interest rate environment, but we believe that this environment cannot be sustained indefinitely and interest rates would be expected to rise as the economy recovers. A strengthening U.S. economy would be expected to cause the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to increase short-term interest rates, which would increase our borrowing costs.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions out of our control.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 96% of our investment securities portfolio was comprised of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprises obligations, U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprises mortgage-backed securities and securities of municipalities. As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was approximately $1.0 billion. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the credit markets. In addition, we have historically taken a conservative investment posture, concentrating on government issuances of short duration. In the future, we may seek to increase yields through more aggressive investment strategies, which may include a greater percentage of corporate issuances and structured credit products. Any of these mentioned factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments in future periods and result in a realized loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nBecause of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant deferred tax asset that may not be fully realized in the future.\nOur net deferred tax asset totaled $129.6 million as of December 31, 2014, of which $64.4 million was excluded from Tier 1 Capital. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to the expiration of the related net operating losses and the limitations of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. If our estimates and assumptions about future taxable income are not accurate, the value of our deferred tax asset may not be recoverable and may result in a valuation allowance that would impact our earnings.\nIf we are unable to maintain sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers.\nLiquidity is important to our business as our liquidity is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Further deterioration in the credit markets or market liquidity could present significant challenges in the management of our liquidity and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. For example, if as a result of a sudden decline in depositor confidence resulting from negative market conditions, a substantial number of bank customers tried to withdraw their bank deposits simultaneously; our reserves may not be able to cover the withdrawals.\nFurthermore, an inability to increase our deposit base at all or at attractive rates would impede our ability to fund our continued growth, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Collateralized borrowings such as advances from the FHLB are an important potential source of liquidity. Our borrowing capacity is generally dependent on the value of the collateral pledged to the FHLB. An adverse regulatory change could reduce our borrowing capacity or eliminate certain types of collateral and could otherwise modify or even eliminate our access to FHLB advances, Federal Fund line borrowings and discount window advances. Liquidity may also be adversely impacted by bank supervisory and regulatory authorities mandating changes in the composition of our balance sheet to asset classes that are less liquid. Any such change or termination may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nOur access to other funding sources could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the unstable credit markets. We may need to incur additional debt in the future to achieve our business objectives, in connection with future acquisitions or for other reasons. Any borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on favorable terms. Without sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to retain or develop a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\nWe expect to depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as our primary source of funding for our lending activities. Our future growth will largely depend on our ability to retain and grow a strong deposit base. It may prove harder to maintain and grow our deposit base than would otherwise be the case. We are also working to transition certain of our customers to lower cost traditional banking services as higher cost funding sources, such as high interest certificates of deposit, mature. There may be competitive pressures to pay higher interest rates on deposits, which could increase funding costs and compress net interest margins. Customers may not transition to lower yielding savings or investment products or continue their business with us, which could adversely affect our operations. In addition, with recent concerns about bank failures, customers have become concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the FDIC, particularly customers that may maintain deposits in excess of insured limits. Customers may withdraw deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount that they have on deposit with us is fully insured and may place them in other institutions or make investments that are perceived as being more secure. Further, even if we are able to grow and maintain our deposit base, the account and deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments (or similar products at other institutions that may provide a higher rate of return), we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations, which could materially negatively impact our growth strategy and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers, which may decrease our growth or profits.\nConsumer and commercial banking is highly competitive. Our market contains not only a large number of community and regional banks, but also a significant presence of the country\u2019s largest commercial banks. We compete with other state and national financial institutions as well as savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions for deposits and loans. In addition, we compete with financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds and several government agencies as well as major retailers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services. Some of these competitors may have a long history of successful operations in our markets, greater ties to local businesses and more expansive banking relationships, as well as better established depositor bases. Competitors with greater resources may possess an advantage by being capable of maintaining numerous banking locations in more convenient sites, operating more ATMs and conducting extensive promotional and advertising campaigns or operating a more developed Internet platform.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to compete in our market without a retail footprint by offering competitive rates, as well as non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for certain products and services than we can. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on quality service and high ethical standards;\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business effectively;\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.\nWe are subject to losses due to the errors or fraudulent behavior of employees or third parties.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. Our business is dependent on our employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. When we originate loans, we rely upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal and title information, if applicable, and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of our security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party service providers, could result in financial losses to us or in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including client information.\nAs a financial institution, we may be the target of fraudulent activity that may result in financial losses to us or our clients, privacy breaches against our clients or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, unauthorized intrusion into or use of our systems, and other dishonest acts. We provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including online over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.\nWe also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks (e.g., Visa, MasterCard) and our processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. We also rely on numerous other third party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them. While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third parties, we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nAny inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and our plans to continue to provide electronic banking services to our customers.\nAs a public company, we are required to meet periodic reporting requirements under the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Complying with federal securities laws as a public company is expensive, and we will incur significant time and expense enhancing, documenting, testing and certifying our internal control over financial reporting. Any deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nPrior to becoming a public company, we were not required to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cSEC\u201d) requirements to have our financial statements completed and reviewed or audited within a specified time. As a publicly traded company we are required to file periodic reports containing our financial statements with the SEC within a specified time following the completion of quarterly and annual periods. We may experience difficulty in meeting the SEC\u2019s reporting requirements. Any failure by us to file our periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner could harm our reputation and reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses. Compliance with other rules of the SEC and the rules of The Nasdaq Global Select Market (which we refer to as \u201cNasdaq\u201d) will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. Beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, or such earlier time as we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), our independent registered certified public accounting firm will be required to attest to our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting. This process will require significant documentation of policies, procedures and systems, review of that documentation by our internal staff and our outside auditors and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting by our internal staff and our outside independent registered certified public accounting firm. This process will involve considerable time and expense, may strain our internal resources and have an adverse impact on our operating costs. We may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses and outside auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter.\nDuring the course of our testing, we may identify deficiencies that would have to be remediated to satisfy the SEC rules for certification of our internal controls over financial reporting. As a consequence, we may have to disclose in periodic reports we file with the SEC material weaknesses in our system of internal controls. The existence of a material weakness would preclude management from concluding that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective and would preclude our independent auditors from issuing an unqualified opinion that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective. In addition, disclosures of this type in our SEC reports could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and may negatively affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud. If we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting, it may negatively impact our business, results of operations and reputation.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors. In addition, our election not to opt out of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may make our financial statements less easily comparable to the financial statements of other companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Currently, we take advantage of not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but we do not currently take advantage of the other reporting exemptions available under the JOBS Act. However, we may avail ourselves of these reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as we are an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million). We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we do or may rely on these exemptions in the future. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act of 1933, amended (which we refer to as the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. Although we are not currently taking advantage of this extended transition period, we could choose to do so in the future (so long as we are an emerging growth company) and this could make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events would negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur market areas in the southeastern region of the United States are susceptible to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, other severe weather events and related flooding and wind damage, and manmade disasters. Our market areas in Tennessee are susceptible to natural disasters, such as tornadoes and floods. These natural disasters could negatively impact regional economic conditions, cause a decline in the value or destruction of mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loss on loans originated by us, damage our banking facilities and offices and negatively impact our growth strategy. Such weather events can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where they operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future hurricanes or tornadoes will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas, but such weather events could negatively impact economic conditions in these regions and result in a decline in local loan demand and loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of natural or manmade disasters.\nRisks Relating to Our Growth Strategy\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth.\nOur future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our growth. Our growth has placed, and it may continue to place, significant demands on our operations and management. Whether through additional acquisitions or organic growth, our current plan to expand our business is dependent upon:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational, credit, financial, management and other internal risk controls and processes and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage a growing number of client relationships;\n\u2022\nto scale our technology platform;\n\u2022\nto integrate our acquisitions and develop consistent policies throughout the various businesses; and\n\u2022\nto manage a growing number of client relationships.\nWe may not successfully implement improvements to, or integrate, our management information and control systems, procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In particular, our controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in expected loan volume and the infrastructure that comes with new branches and banks. Thus, our growth strategy may divert management from our existing businesses and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure and, if we are unable to effectively manage and grow our banking franchise, our business and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, if we are unable to manage future expansion in our operations, we may experience compliance and operational problems, have to slow the pace of growth, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nWe intend to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of banks and other financial institutions. Generally, any acquisition of target financial institutions or assets by us will require approval by, and cooperation from, a number of governmental regulatory agencies, possibly including the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC, as well as state banking regulators. In acting on such applications of approval, federal banking regulators consider, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe effect of the acquisition on competition;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and future prospects of the applicant and the banks involved;\n\u2022\nthe managerial resources of the applicant and the banks involved;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and needs of the community, including the record of performance under the CRA;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of the applicant in combating money-laundering activities; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.\nSuch regulators could deny our application based on the above criteria or other considerations or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us. For example, we could be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approvals, and such a condition may not be acceptable to us or may reduce the benefit of any acquisition. In addition, prior to the submission of an application our regulators could discourage us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or indicate that regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that would be acceptable to us, which could have the same effect of restricting our growth or reducing the benefit of any acquisitions.\nThe success of future transactions will depend on our ability to successfully identify and consummate transactions with target financial institutions that meet our investment criteria. Because of the significant competition for acquisition opportunities and the limited number of potential targets, we may not be able to successfully consummate acquisitions necessary to grow our business.\nThe success of future transactions will depend on our ability to successfully identify and consummate transactions with target financial institutions that meet our investment criteria. There are significant risks associated with our ability to identify and successfully consummate transactions with target financial institutions. There are a limited number of acquisition opportunities, and we expect to encounter intense competition from other banking organizations competing for acquisitions and also from other investment funds and entities looking to acquire financial institutions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting acquisitions directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess ongoing banking operations with greater technical, human and other resources than we do, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.\nThese organizations may be able to achieve greater cost savings through consolidating operations than we could. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target institutions will be limited by our available financial resources. These inherent competitive limitations give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target financial institutions. In addition, increased competition may drive up the prices for the types of acquisitions we intend to target, which would make the identification and successful consummation of acquisition opportunities more difficult. Competitors may be willing to pay more for target financial institutions than we believe are justified, which could result in us having to pay more for target financial institutions than we prefer or to forego target financial institutions. As a result of the foregoing, we may be unable to successfully identify and consummate future transactions to grow our business on commercially attractive terms, or at all.\nBecause the institutions we intend to acquire may have distressed assets, we may not be able to realize the value we predict from these assets or make sufficient provision for future losses in the value of, or accurately estimate the future writedowns taken in respect of, these assets.\nDelinquencies and losses in the loan portfolios and other assets of financial institutions that we acquire may exceed our initial forecasts developed during the due diligence investigation prior to acquiring those institutions. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on an entity we decide to acquire, this diligence may not reveal all material issues that may affect a particular entity. The diligence process in FDIC-assisted transactions is also expedited due to the short acquisition timeline that is typical for these depository institutions. If, during the diligence process, we fail to identify issues specific to an entity or the environment in which the entity operates, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in other reporting losses. Any of these events could adversely affect the financial condition, liquidity, capital position and value of institutions we acquire and of the Company as a whole.\nCurrent economic conditions have created an uncertain environment with respect to asset valuations and there is no certainty that we will be able to sell assets of target institutions if we determine it would be in our best interests to do so. The institutions we will target may have substantial amounts of asset classes for which there is currently limited or no marketability.\nThe success of future transactions will depend on our ability to successfully combine the target financial institution\u2019s business with our existing banking business and, if we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe success of future transactions will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the target financial institution\u2019s business with our existing banking business. As with any acquisition involving financial institutions, there may be business disruptions that result in the loss of customers or cause customers to remove their accounts and move their business to competing banking institutions. It is possible that the integration process could result in additional expenses in connection with the integration processes and the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Integration efforts, including integration of the target financial institution\u2019s systems into our systems may divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and we may be unable to develop, or experience prolonged delays in the development of, the systems necessary to operate our acquired banks, such as a financial reporting platform or a human resources reporting platform call center. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of any future transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, we may be unable to recognize synergies, operating efficiencies and/or expected benefits within expected timeframes or expected cost projections, or at all. We may also not be able to preserve the goodwill of the acquired financial institution.\nProjected operating results for entities to be acquired by us may be inaccurate and may vary significantly from actual results.\nWe will generally establish the pricing of transactions and the capital structure of entities to be acquired by us on the basis of financial projections for such entities. In general, projected operating results will be based primarily on management judgments. In all cases, projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed and the projected results may vary significantly from actual results. General economic, political and market conditions, which are not predictable, can have a material adverse impact on the reliability of such projections. In the event that the projections made in connection with our acquisitions, or future projections with respect to new acquisitions, are not accurate, such inaccuracies could materially and adversely affect our business and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nOur officers and directors may have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business opportunities to us or another entity with which they are, or may become, affiliated.\nOur officers and directors may become subject to fiduciary obligations in connection with their service on the boards of directors of other corporations. To the extent that our officers and directors become aware of acquisition opportunities that may be suitable for entities other than us to which they have fiduciary or contractual obligations, or they are presented with such opportunities in their capacities as fiduciaries to such entities, they may honor such obligations to such other entities. In addition, our officers and directors will not have any obligation to present us with any acquisition opportunity that does not fall within certain parameters of our business (which opportunities and parameters are described in more detail in the section entitled \u201cBusiness\u201d). You should assume that to the extent any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an opportunity that may be suitable both for us and another entity to which such person has a fiduciary obligation or contractual obligation to present such opportunity as set forth above, he or she may first give the opportunity to such other entity or entities and may give such opportunity to us only to the extent such other entity or entities reject or are unable to pursue such opportunity. In addition, you should assume that to the extent any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity that does not fall within the above parameters but that may otherwise be suitable for us, he or she may not present such opportunity to us. In general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under Delaware law are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity, the opportunity is within the corporation\u2019s line of business and it would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation. However, our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in certain acquisition opportunities that our officers or directors become aware of in connection with their service to other entities to which they have a fiduciary or contractual obligation.\nChanges in accounting standards may affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (which we refer to as the \u201cFASB\u201d) or other regulatory authorities change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect customers, depositors, consumers, deposit insurance funds and the stability of the U.S. financial system, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividend or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. We are currently facing increased regulation and supervision of our industry as a result of the financial crisis in the banking and financial markets. Such additional regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are periodically subject to examination and scrutiny by a number of banking agencies and, depending upon the findings and determinations of these agencies, we may be required to make adjustments to our business that could adversely affect us.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a Federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentration, earnings prospects, management, liquidity sensitivity to market risk or other aspects of any of our operations has become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management is in violation of any law or regulation, it could take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nThe enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may have a material effect on our operations.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. The key effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business are:\n\u2022\nchanges to regulatory capital requirements;\n\u2022\nexclusion of hybrid securities, including trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010 from Tier 1 capital;\n\u2022\ncreation of new government regulatory agencies (such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which will oversee systemic risk, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will develop and enforce rules for bank and non-bank providers of consumer financial products);\n\u2022\npotential limitations on federal preemption;\n\u2022\nchanges to deposit insurance assessments;\n\u2022\nregulation of debit interchange fees we earn;\n\u2022\nchanges in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments.\nSome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment. Many provisions, however, will require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented. Some of these regulations are complete and others have been proposed by the applicable federal agencies. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may have unintended effects, which will not be clear until full implementation. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to investors in our Class A common stock.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the new regulatory capital standards and the new capital rules is uncertain.\nAs discussed in detail above, the Federal banking agencies recently revised capital guidelines to reflect the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and to effect the implementation of the Basel III Accords. The quantitative measures, established by the regulators to ensure capital adequacy, require that a bank holding company maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. These minimums are outlined above. Various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act increase the capital requirements of bank holding companies, such as the Company, and non-bank financial companies that are supervised by the Federal Reserve. For us, as a bank holding company, common equity Tier 1 capital, a new category, includes only common stock, related surplus, retained earnings and qualified minority investments. Additional Tier 1 capital includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, certain qualifying minority interests, and for bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets, cumulative perpetual preferred stock and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital includes subordinated debt, certain qualifying minority investments, and for bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets, non-qualifying capital instruments issued before May 19, 2010 that exceed 25% of Tier 1. Bank holding companies are also required to hold a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital of 2.5% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and executive compensation payments. The capital rules also codify a Tier 1 leverage ratio that has long been used by the agencies as an indicator of risk.\nUnder the guidelines, capital is compared with the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, a risk weighting is applied to each balance sheet asset and off-balance sheet item, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the asset or counterparty. The revised capital rules also modified the risk-weights applied to particular on and off balance sheet assets.\nThe revised capital rules, which became effective as of January 1, 2015, require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a total Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%, a total capital ratio of 10%, and a leverage ratio of 5% to be deemed \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\nThe Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. At this time, the bank regulatory agencies are more inclined to impose higher capital requirements in order to meet well-capitalized standards, and future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. Our regulatory capital ratios and those of Capital Bank are in excess of the levels established for \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institutions.\nThe FDIC\u2019s restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could adversely affect our earnings.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as our subsidiary bank, up to applicable limits. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. Market developments have significantly depleted the DIF and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.\nAs a result of recent economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, there may need to be further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect results of operations, including by reducing our profitability or limiting our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nWe are subject to federal and state and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the CRA and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service.\nThere is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support our subsidiary bank.\nThe Federal Reserve, which examines us and our subsidiaries, requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, both statue and regulation require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to our subsidiary bank if it experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nStockholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of Capital Bank, which could impose prior approval requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders.\nWe are a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, acquisition of control of us (or our bank subsidiary) requires prior regulatory notice or approval. With certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit potential investors from, directly or indirectly, acquiring ownership or control of, or the power to vote, more than 10% (more than 5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting securities, or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of directors or otherwise exercising a controlling influence over our management or policies, without prior notice or application to, and approval of, the Federal Reserve under the Change in Bank Control Act or the BHCA. Any bank holding company or foreign bank with a U.S. presence also is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA to acquire or retain more than 5% of our outstanding voting securities.\nIn addition to regulatory approvals, any stockholder deemed to \u201ccontrol\u201d us for purposes of the BHCA would become subject to investment and activity restrictions and ongoing regulation and supervision. Any entity owning 25% or more of any class of our voting securities, or a lesser percentage if such holder or group otherwise exercises a \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d over us, will be subject to regulation as a \u201cbank holding company\u201d in accordance with the BHCA. In addition, such a holder may be required to divest holdings of 5% or more of the voting securities of investments that may be deemed impermissible for a bank holding company, such as an investment in a company engaged in non-financial activities.\nRegulatory determination of \u201ccontrol\u201d of a depository institution or holding company is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. In certain instances, stockholders may be determined to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d and their shares aggregated for purposes of determining control for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act. \u201cActing in concert\u201d generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a parent company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. How this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary among the various federal bank regulatory agencies and cannot always be predicted with certainty. Many factors can lead to a finding of acting in concert, including whether:\n\u2022\nstockholders are commonly controlled or managed;\n\u2022\nstockholders are parties to an oral or written agreement or understanding regarding the acquisition, voting or transfer of control of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company;\n\u2022\nthe holders each own stock in a bank and are also management officials, controlling stockholders, partners or trustees of another company; or\n\u2022\nboth a holder and a controlling stockholder, partner, trustee or management official of the holder own equity in the bank or bank holding company. Our common stock owned by holders determined by a bank regulatory agency to be acting in concert would be aggregated for purposes of determining whether those holders have control of a bank or bank holding company for Change in Bank Control Act purposes. Because the control regulations under the Change in Bank Control Act and the BHCA are complex, potential investors should seek advice from qualified banking counsel before making an investment in our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe could issue additional common stock, which might dilute the book value of our common stock and reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares that may be issued to satisfy our obligations under our incentive plans, shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock and securities and instruments that are convertible into our common stock. Such stock issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium from the then-current trading price of our common stock and might dilute the book value of our common stock. In addition, issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, likely would result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.\nIf shares of Class B non-voting common stock are converted into shares of Class A common stock, your voting power will be diluted.\nGenerally, holders of Class B non-voting common stock have no voting power and have no right to participate in any meeting of stockholders or to have notice thereof. However, holders of Class B non-voting common stock that are converted into Class A common stock will have all the voting rights of the other holders of Class A common stock. Class B non-voting common stock is not convertible in the hands of the initial holder. However, a transferee unaffiliated with the initial holder that receives Class B non-voting common stock subsequent to transfer permitted by our certificate of incorporation may elect to convert each share of Class B non-voting common stock into one share of Class A common stock. Upon conversion of any Class B non-voting common stock, your voting power will be diluted in proportion to the decrease in your ownership of the total outstanding Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\ndowngrades in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. In the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business or results of operations. For example, we are currently operating in, and have benefited from, a protracted period of historically low interest rates that may not be sustained indefinitely, and future fluctuations in interest rates could cause an increase in volatility of the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends will be subject to restrictions under applicable banking laws and regulations.\nBanks and bank holding companies are subject to certain regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. The payment of dividends by us, depending on our financial condition, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. Our ability to pay dividends will directly depend on the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends to us, which in turn will be restricted by the requirement that it maintains an adequate level of capital in accordance with requirements of its regulators and, in the future, can be expected to be further influenced by regulatory policies and capital guidelines. In addition, on August 24, 2010, Capital Bank entered into the OCC Operating Agreement, which in certain circumstances will restrict Capital Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us, to make changes to its capital structure and to make certain other business decisions.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the loss sharing agreements may have anti-takeover effects, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management. In addition, Delaware law may inhibit takeovers of us and could limit our ability to engage in certain strategic transactions our Board of Directors believes would be in the best interests of stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock, which may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage\ntransactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities, including our Class A common stock.\nOur loss sharing agreements with the FDIC require that we receive prior FDIC consent, which may be withheld by the FDIC in its sole discretion, prior to us or our stockholders engaging in certain transactions. If any such transaction is completed without prior FDIC consent, the FDIC would have the right to discontinue the relevant loss sharing arrangement. Among other things, prior FDIC consent is required for (1) a merger or consolidation of us or our bank subsidiary with or into another company if our stockholders will own less than 66.66% of the combined company, (2) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of any of our bank subsidiary and (3) a sale of shares by a stockholder, or a group of related stockholders, that will effect a change in control of Capital Bank, as determined by the FDIC with reference to the standards set forth in the Change in Bank Control Act (generally, the acquisition of between 10% and 25% of any class of our voting securities where the presumption of control is not rebutted, or the acquisition by any person, acting directly or indirectly or through or in concert with one or more persons, of 25% or more of any class of our voting securities). If we or any stockholder desired to enter into any such transaction, the FDIC may not grant its consent in a timely manner, without conditions, or at all. If one of these transactions were to occur without prior FDIC consent and the FDIC withdrew its loss share protection, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, statutes, regulations and policies that govern bank holding companies, including the BHCA, may restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. We have not opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (which we refer to as the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination (as defined in such section) with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation or any person affiliated with such person) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless (1) prior to such time the Board of Directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (2) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or (3) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder.", "PERMNO": 13594, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBF"}
