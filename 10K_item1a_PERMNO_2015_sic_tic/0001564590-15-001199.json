{"cik": "1009356", "company": "SALIX PHARMACEUTICALS LTD", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference.\nIf any of the following risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and stockholders might lose all or part of their investment.\nSalix and Valeant must obtain required approvals and governmental and regulatory consents to consummate the transaction, which, if delayed, not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions, may delay or jeopardize the consummation of the transaction, and/or result in additional expenditures of money and resources.\nThe transaction is subject to several closing conditions. These closing conditions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe tender of a sufficient number of Salix shares to satisfy the minimum conditions of the Offer; and\n\u2022\nthe expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.\nWe cannot assure you that a sufficient number of Salix shares will be tendered in the Offer or that the required closing conditions will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals. This could result in a failure to consummate the transaction or have a material adverse effect on Salix\u2019s business and results of operations.\nFailure to consummate the transaction with Valeant could negatively impact the share price and the future business and financial results of Salix.\nIf the transaction is not consummated, the ongoing businesses of Salix may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having consummated the transactions, Salix will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nSalix will be required to pay costs and expenses relating to the proposed transaction;\n\u2022\nthe current price of Salix common stock may reflect a market assumption that the merger will occur, meaning that a failure to complete the transaction could result in a material decline in the price of Salix common stock;\n\u2022\nif the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Salix may be required to pay to VPI a termination fee of $356.4 million plus out-of-pocket expenses of Valeant, VPI and Merger Sub up to a maximum of $50 million;\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the transactions (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by Salix management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Salix; and\n\u2022\nSalix also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to consummate the transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against Salix to perform its obligations under the merger agreement.\nIf the transaction is not consummated, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect Salix\u2019s business, financial results and share price.\nWe depend heavily on sales of Xifaxan and certain of our other marketed products. If future sales of these marketed products might be less than expected, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently actively market and sell more than 20 products. We expect Xifaxan, which was launched in mid-2004 for the treatment of TD, and approved and launched in March 2010 for the treatment of HE, to continue to be our most significant source of revenue in the future. If sales of our marketed products decline or if we experience product returns significantly in excess of estimated amounts recorded, particularly with respect to Xifaxan, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our products among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nthe timing of regulatory approvals and product launches by us or competitors, and including any generic or OTC competitors;\n\u2022\nperceptions by physicians and other members of the healthcare community regarding the safety and efficacy of our products;\n\u2022\nprice increases, and the price of our products relative to other drugs or competing treatments;\n\u2022\npatient and physician demand;\n\u2022\nadverse side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our products or other drugs in our class;\n\u2022\nthe results of product development efforts for new indications;\n\u2022\nthe scope and timing of additional marketing approvals and favorable reimbursement programs for expanded uses;\n\u2022\nthe availability of sufficient commercial quantities of the products; and\n\u2022\nour success in getting other companies to distribute our products outside of the U.S. gastroenterology, hepatology and colorectal surgery markets\nPlease also see the discussion of certain expected impacts to our results of operations from the level of inventory held by our wholesalers under Part II. Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Revenues.\u201d\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the convertibles notes, notes and credit facilities described below.\nOur convertible senior notes due 2015, or 2015 Notes, which have a face amount of approximately $345.0 million, mature on May 15, 2015. Our convertible senior notes due 2019, or 2019 Notes, have a face amount of approximately $690.0 million. The 2015 Notes may be converted by holders thereof pursuant to the terms thereof until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their stated maturity date. The 2019 Notes (collectively with the 2015 Notes, the Convertible Notes) may be converted by holders thereof pursuant to the terms thereof unless the conditions precedent to such conversion right, which are currently satisfied, cease in the future to be satisfied. In July 2014 we notified the trustee for each of the Convertible Notes that we had elected to satisfy any conversion of the Convertible Notes submitted thereafter by paying a combination of cash and stock, with the face amount of the Convertible Notes so converted to be paid in cash and any conversion consideration in excess of such amount to be paid in stock. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash and/or liquidity to satisfy the Convertible Notes at their respective maturities or at the time of any conversion of the Convertible Notes by the holders thereof without seeking other sources of financing to refinance such indebtedness or alternative measures to reduce cash payment obligations thereunder, which such financing or alternative measures may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn addition, if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of the credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, governing our $1.2 billion term loan facility, or the Term Loan B Facility, and our $150.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Credit Facility, the indenture governing the $750 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% notes due 2021, or the 2021 Notes, and other existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The credit agreement and the indenture governing the 2021 Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nThe Credit Agreement does not include any financial maintenance covenants, with the exception that if more than 25% of the Revolving Credit Facility is being utilized, the total leverage ratio requirement (measured as of the last day of each quarter), which\ndecreases over time, must be satisfied. At December 31, 2014 we were not in compliance with the total leverage ratio requirement under the Credit Agreement, which means, among other things, we are unable to utilize more than 25% of the Revolving Credit Facility. Accordingly, we may be required to seek other sources of financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. At December 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nRegulatory approval of our product candidates is time-consuming, expensive and uncertain, and could result in unexpectedly high expenses.\nDevelopment of our products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. To market a new drug in the U.S., we must submit to the FDA and obtain FDA approval of an NDA or a BLA. An NDA or BLA must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the applicable product candidate. The FDA\u2019s regulatory review of NDAs and BLAs is becoming increasingly focused on product safety attributes, and even if approved, our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested and such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product candidate may be marketed, restricted distribution methods or other limitations. In addition, the FDA\u2019s large workload has led to delays in its review of NDA submissions, which could require us to incur significant unexpected expenses or delay or limit our ability to sell product candidates for which we have not yet received regulatory approval.\nFailure can occur at any stage of clinical testing. The clinical study process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans or effective for their intended uses. Our clinical tests must comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulations, including a requirement that they be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices. We may encounter delays based on our inability to timely enroll enough patients to complete our clinical studies. We may suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies, even after showing promising results in earlier studies. Based on results at any stage of clinical studies, we may decide to discontinue development of a product candidate. In addition, we or the FDA may suspend clinical studies at any time if the patients participating in the studies are exposed to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our applications to conduct the clinical studies or in the conduct of our studies.\nIf regulatory approval of any product is granted, it will be limited to those indications for which the product has been shown to be safe and effective, as demonstrated to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction through clinical studies. In addition, before the FDA approves one of our investigational drugs, the FDA may choose to conduct an inspection of one or more clinical or manufacturing sites. These inspections may be conducted by the FDA both at U.S. sites as well as overseas. Any restrictions on the ability of FDA investigators to travel overseas to conduct such inspections, either because of financial or other reasons including political unrest, disease outbreaks or terrorism, could delay the inspection of overseas sites and consequently delay FDA approval of our investigational drugs.\nTo market drugs outside the U.S., we and current or future collaborators must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries. Regulatory approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods, including obtaining reimbursement approval in select markets. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.\nIn addition to the general development and regulatory risks described above, each of our investigational drugs is subject to additional risks that may cause us to incur significant additional costs and the FDA, or applicable foreign regulator, may ultimately refuse to approve of one or more of our product candidates. As explained in the risk factor below regarding the FDA\u2019s ability to require significant additional clinical testing for our product candidates, the number, types, and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials required by the FDA depend on a variety of factors. If we experience delays or setbacks for any reason, our product development costs will increase and we may decide to abandon a product candidate entirely. If any of our product candidates fail to receive regulatory approval, we will have incurred significant expenses without the possibility of generating revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDA may require significant additional clinical testing for our product candidates, and we may not receive regulatory approval for some or all of these product candidates.\nThe number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for NDA or BLA approval varies depending on the drug, the disease or the condition that the drug is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular drug. We could encounter problems that cause us to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies, CMC studies or clinical studies. Our clinical studies might be delayed or halted, or additional studies might be required, for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe drug is not effective;\n\u2022\npatients experience severe side effects during treatment;\n\u2022\npatients do not enroll in the studies at the rate expected;\n\u2022\ndrug supplies are not sufficient to treat the patients in the studies; or\n\u2022 we decide to modify the drug during testing.\nFor example, in August 2010, the FDA accepted our NDA for rifaximin for IBS-D, and gave us an action date of December 7, 2010. In October 2010, the FDA informed us that it was extending the action date by three months to provide for a full review and extended our action date to March 7, 2011. We received a CRL on March 7, 2011. The FDA had determined that the Xifaxan 550 mg sNDA was not ready for approval, primarily due to a newly expressed need for retreatment information. On August 29, 2014, we submitted our response to the March 7, 2011 CRL. The FDA has informed us that it considers our resubmission of the sNDA to be accepted for review. The resubmission is considered a class 2 response to CRL and was initially assigned a user fee goal date of February 28, 2015, which has since been extended to May 27, 2015. There is no assurance, however, that the FDA will approve rifaximin for IBS-D in a timely manner, or at all.\nRegulatory approvals, even if granted, might entail ongoing requirements or restrictions on marketing. These requirements or restrictions, or inquiries into our marketing practices, could increase our expenses and limit revenue.\nRegulatory approvals might entail ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or limit how or to whom we can sell our products. Even if we obtain regulatory approvals, labeling and promotional activities are subject to continual scrutiny by the FDA and other federal and state authorities. For example, in 2008, the FDA required us to put a \u201cblack box\u201d warning on the OsmoPrep and Visicol labels regarding potential kidney damage that could result from their use, and a \u201cblack box\u201d warning for Metozolv regarding tardive dyskensia which could result from its use. We believe these warnings contributed to reduced sales of those products, and they could limit future sales of these products.\nIn addition, we periodically receive inquiries from authorities, including specifically the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion of the FDA, regarding compliance with marketing and other regulations. Responding to inquiries from authorities can be costly and divert the time and attention of our senior management from our business operations and result in increased legal expenses. The laws and regulations regarding off-label promotion and the authorities\u2019 interpretation of them might increase our expenses, impair our ability to effectively market our products, and limit our revenue.\nOn February 1, 2013, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York requesting documents regarding our sales and promotional practices for Xifaxan, Relistor and Apriso. The Company is in the process of responding to the subpoena and intends to cooperate fully with the subpoena and related government investigation, which has and will continue to increase our legal expenses, and might require management time and attention. Currently, we cannot predict or determine the timing or outcome of this inquiry or its impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast wholesaler demand and monitor wholesaler inventory levels of our major products. Although we attempt to monitor wholesaler inventory, we also rely on third party information, which is inherently uncertain and may not be accurate, to assist us in monitoring estimated inventory levels and prescription trends. Inaccurate forecast of the demand for, and inventory levels of, a product may cause our revenues to deviate significantly from expectations, which could adversely affect our operating results, as well as our stock price.\nThe substantial majority of sales of our products are to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors who, in turn, sell the products to pharmacies, hospitals, group purchasing organizations and other customers. Four wholesale pharmaceutical distributors individually comprised 39%, 26%, 18% and 9%, respectively, of our total gross product sales for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nHistorically, we have not had distribution services agreements with any of our major wholesale distributors and accordingly have had no control over their buying patterns, which have fluctuated in response to, among other things, their inventory levels of our products, discounts we have offered, anticipated future price increases or other factors that did not directly correlate to end-user demand. We announced in November 2014 that we were negotiating with our principal wholesalers to enter into distribution services agreements for each of the products in our portfolio and that we expected these distribution services agreements to be finalized and become effective in the first quarter of 2015, but we have subsequently agreed in our merger agreement with Valeant that we will not enter into any distribution services agreement pending the completion of the merger without Valeant\u2019s consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). As a result, if we do not enter into these distribution services agreements, we will be delaying the benefits of the distribution services agreements we had intended to enter into prior to entering into the Valeant merger agreement, which included enabling us to better forecast revenue and expenses.\nAs discussed in Part II. Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d notwithstanding delaying entering into distribution services agreements, we intend to reduce wholesaler inventory levels of Xifaxan 550, Apriso and Uceris to approximately 3 months at or before the end of 2015, depending on future demand for these products, as previously announced. We believe this is an appropriate level of inventory for our products given the prescription growth rates of our products and other relevant factors. Even after the inventory held by wholesalers has reached desired levels, the wholesalers will make estimates to determine end-user prescription demand, and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory levels to actual end-user prescription demand.\nIn addition to wholesalers, inventory is held at retail pharmacies and other non-wholesale locations over whose buying patterns we also have no control. Adverse changes in economic conditions and other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and, consequently, the wholesalers\u2019 orders from us, even if end-user prescription demand has not changed. As a result, changes to inventory levels held by wholesalers may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to wholesalers do not match end-user prescription demand, which could adversely affect our operating results, as well as our stock price.\nOur intellectual property rights might not afford us with meaningful protection, which could result in substantial costs to us and negatively affect our revenues by impacting our pricing and sales volume as well as royalties and other payments owed to us by third parties.\nThe intellectual property rights protecting our products might not afford us with meaningful protection from generic and other competition. In addition, because our strategy is to in-license or acquire pharmaceutical products which typically have been discovered and initially researched by others, future products might have limited or no remaining patent protection due to the time elapsed since their discovery.\nCompetitors could also design around any of our intellectual property or otherwise design competitive products that do not infringe our intellectual property.\nFor instance, we commenced litigation during 2014 against Par and Mylan and in 2015 against Par, Actavis and Alvogen, which have launched Paragraph IV challenges against certain of our products. A Paragraph IV challenge arises when an ANDA includes certification by the competing company that, in that company\u2019s opinion, its product does not infringe another company\u2019s listed patents or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable. See Part I. Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If competitors are successful in such claims, we could experience reduced revenues from lower sales volume, the need to reduce our prices, or both.\nIn addition, upon expiration of patent protection, our drugs could become subject to generic competition, which could negatively affect our product pricing and sales volume. We experienced this result with Colazal, which was our largest selling drug prior to 2008, when generic competition began following expiration of our intellectual property for Colazal. See Part I. Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Patents and Proprietary Rights\u201d for additional information about the existing intellectual property protection for our products.\nAny litigation in which we become involved to enforce intellectual property rights could also result in substantial cost to us. In addition, claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could be costly. Our patent or other proprietary rights related to our products might conflict with the current or future intellectual property rights of others. Litigation or patent interference proceedings, either of which could result in substantial cost to us, might be necessary to defend any patent and other intellectual property to which we have rights or to determine the scope and validity of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. The defense of patent and other intellectual property claims is both costly and time-consuming, even if the outcome is favorable. Any adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties, or require us to cease selling one or more of our products. We might not be able to obtain a license to any third-party technology that we require to conduct our business, or, if obtainable, that technology might not be available at a reasonable cost.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technological advances, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with collaborative partners, employees and consultants. These agreements might be breached and we might not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how might otherwise become known or be independently developed by others.\nIntense competition might render our products noncompetitive or obsolete.\nCompetition in our business is intense and characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. Technological developments by competitors, regulatory approval for marketing competitive products, including potential generic or OTC products, or superior marketing resources possessed by competitors could adversely affect the commercial potential of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. We believe that there are numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including large well-known pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic research groups, engaged in research and development efforts with respect to pharmaceutical products targeted at diseases and conditions addressed by our current and potential products. Developments by others might render our current and potential products obsolete or noncompetitive. Competitors might be able to complete the development and regulatory approval process sooner and, therefore, market their products earlier than we can.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and personnel resources and development capabilities than we do. For example, many large, well-capitalized companies already offer products in the United States and Europe that target the indications for:\n\u2022 Xifaxan for HE, including lactulose (various manufacturers);\n\u2022\nXifaxan for TD, including ciprofloxacin, commonly known as Cipro (Bayer);\n\u2022\nApriso, including Asacol HD and Delzicol (Actavis plc, or Actavis), sulfasalazine (Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, or Pfizer), Dipentum (Alaven), Pentasa and once-a-day Lialda (Shire Pharmaceuticals Group, or Shire) and three generic balsalazide disodium capsule products;\n\u2022\nUceris, including Asacol HD and Delzicol (Actavis), Lialda and Pentasa (Shire), Remicade (Janssen) and Humira (AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie);\n\u2022\nOsmoPrep and MoviPrep, including Colyte (Meda Pharmaceuticals), Golytely (Braintree Laboratories, Inc., or Braintree), Halflytely (Braintree), SuPrep (Braintree), Suclear (Braintree), and Nulytely (Braintree), Trilyte (Alaven Pharmaceutical LLC, or Alaven) and Prepopik (Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), as well as potential generics from Novel or others;\n\u2022\nZegerid, including Nexium (AZ), Aciphex (Eisai Inc.) and Dexilant (Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Takeda) and various generics and OTI PPI products;\n\u2022\nGlumetza, including Fortamet (Andrx Laboratories LLC), Glucophage and Glucophage XR (Bristol Myers Squibb, or BMS), various generics and other prescription diabetes treatments;\n\u2022\nRelistor for OIC, including OTC laxatives (various manufacturers), Amitiza (Sucampo), Movantik (AstraZeneca plc, or AZ), Kristalose (Cumberland), and Entereg (Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.);\n\u2022\nSolesta, including various OTC antidiarrheals, fiber, stool softeners and laxatives (various manufacturers), biofeedback, the medical device Inter Stim (Medtronic) and sphincteroplasty surgery;\n\u2022\nMetozolv ODT, including Reglan (Ani Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), and various generics;\n\u2022\nCycloset, including Januvia (Merck), Onglyza (BMS), Byetta (Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Amylin), Victoza (Novo Nordisk Inc.), Bydureon (Amylin), Avandia (SB PharmCo), Actos (Takeda), Amaryl (Sanofi Aventis), Glynase (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Inc.) and various branded and generic metformin products;\n\u2022\nFenoglide, including Trico (AbbVie), Antara (Lupin Atlantis), Lipofen (Cipher Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), Lopid (Pfizer), Trilipix (AbbVie) and other prescription treatments for primary hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia (such as statins and niacin); and\n\u2022 Ruconest, including Cinryze (Shire), Berinert (CSL Behring), Kalbitor (Dyax) and Firazyr (Shire).\nFailure to integrate our acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business.\nOur strategy is to identify and acquire rights to products that we believe have potential for near-term regulatory approval or are already approved, through the purchase or license of products and purchase of companies. Our integration of the operations of acquired products and businesses, including Santarus, which we acquired on January 2, 2014, required significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing and finance. These efforts resulted in additional expenses and involved significant amounts of management\u2019s time. In addition, acquisitions may result in our assumption of unknown and/or unexpected, and perhaps material, liabilities. Factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions, include the strength of the acquired companies\u2019 or products\u2019 underlying technology, our ability to execute our business strategy, results of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures, our ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and retain key employees, and our ability to achieve financial and operational synergies with our acquired companies and products, such as by increasing sales of our products, achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products. Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of these acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses or products we acquire will become profitable or remain so or that we will realize that operational cost savings or other expected synergies of an acquisition. If an acquisition is not successful, we may record related asset impairment charges in the future.\nWe could be exposed to significant product liability claims that could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts.\nWe have been in the past and might continue to be subjected to product liability claims that arise through the testing,\nmanufacturing, marketing and sale of our products. We currently have liability coverage for both clinical trials and the\ncommercialization of our products other than claims with regard to OsmoPrep and Visicol filed prior to August 31, 2010, but it is\npossible that this coverage and any future coverage will be insufficient to satisfy any liabilities that arise. We would have to assume\ndefense of the lawsuits and be responsible for damages, fees and expenses, if any, that are awarded against us or for amounts in\nexcess of our product liability coverage. These claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with our\nproduct commercialization efforts. Product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay\nsignificant damages. In the future, we might not be able to obtain adequate coverage at an acceptable cost or might be unable to obtain adequate coverage at all.\nIf government and other third-party payors do not provide coverage or reimburse patients for our products, our ability to derive revenues might suffer.\nOur success will depend in part on the extent to which government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors will pay for our products. Reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products is uncertain. We acquired our first medical devices in December 2011, one of which was launched in 2011, and we are navigating the complex medical device reimbursement system.\nIn the United States and elsewhere, third-party payors, such as Medicaid, are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products. In the United States, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the healthcare system have been passed in recent years, including the Affordable Care Act. Many significant changes in this legislation did not take effect until 2014. These changes to the healthcare system could increase our costs and reduce the amount we can charge for our products. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to increase pressure on pharmaceutical and medical device pricing. While we cannot predict whether legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or what effect those proposals or managed care efforts, including those relating to Medicaid payments, might have on our business, the announcement and/or adoption of such proposals or efforts could increase costs and reduce or eliminate profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Third-party insurance coverage might not be available to patients for our products. If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products, the market acceptance of these products might be reduced.\nOur ability to generate revenue in the future will depend in part on our success in in-licensing or acquiring additional pharmaceutical products or medical devices.\nWe currently intend to in-license or acquire additional pharmaceutical products or medical devices, as we did with crofelemer and Uceris (budesonide) rectal foam, that have been developed beyond the initial discovery phase and for which late-stage human clinical data is already available, or as we did with Relistor, Deflux and Solesta, that have already received regulatory approval. As we have grown, there are fewer of these opportunities that are large enough to have a material impact on our revenues, and we might encounter more competition from larger companies for these opportunities. These kinds of pharmaceutical products and medical devices might not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. To the extent we acquire rights to additional products, we might incur significant additional expense in connection with the development and, if approved by the FDA, marketing of these products.\nCertain of our products require supplies of raw materials that may be subject to uncertainty.\nRaw material used in the production of Fulyzaq is obtained from Croton lechleri trees growing in certain South American countries while a key raw material for Relistor grows in Tasmania, Australia Our ability to obtain reliable supplies of these products is not entirely within our control. Failure to obtain these raw materials or delay in their delivery to us, whether due to international, political or economic conditions or otherwise, could adversely affect our ability to have the relevant products manufactured or, with respect to additional indications for the products, delay our ability to develop the new indications and obtain regulatory approval for them, which could prevent us from generating related revenue.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities and are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products.\nWe own no manufacturing facilities, and we have limited capabilities in manufacturing pharmaceutical products. We do not generally expect to engage directly in the manufacturing of products, but instead contract with and rely on third-party vendors for these services. A limited number of contract manufacturers exist which are capable of manufacturing our marketed products and our product candidates, and, with respect to certain of our products, such as Uceris, a single manufacturer serves as our sole supplier. In addition, in the case of Xifaxan, a single company converts our rifaximin supply into Xifaxan drug product.\nOur manufacturers must comply with U.S. regulations, including cGMP regulations relating to manufacturing, packaging, documentation, quality control and quality assurance, and their facilities must be inspected and approved by the FDA and other regulatory agencies on an ongoing basis. We may be subject to serious consequences if our manufacturers are found to have deficiencies in their manufacturing processes, and/or their overall cGMP compliance (particularly in the case of sole suppliers), including potential delays in the regulatory approval process for our drug candidates and recalls of our commercialized products. For example, in April 2010 we received a CRL from the FDA related to our NDA for Giazo. The sole issue raised in this letter concerned a deficiency of the manufacturing facility for this application, which delayed FDA approval almost two years. Given our ongoing dependence on third-party vendors for the supply and manufacture of material for use in clinical trials and for commercial product, our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks:\n\u2022\nthe manufacture of products might be difficult to scale up when required and result in delays, inefficiencies and poor or low yields of quality products;\n\u2022\nsome of our contracts contain purchase commitments that require us to make minimum purchases that might exceed our needs or limit our ability to negotiate with other manufacturers, which might increase costs;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing certain products might make them prohibitively expensive;\n\u2022\ndelays in scale-up to commercial quantities and any change in manufacturers could delay clinical studies, regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products;\n\u2022\nmanufacturers are subject to the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations and similar foreign standards, and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by the third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nif we need to change manufacturers, transfers of technical expertise would be required which would include educating the new manufacturer in the processes necessary for the production of our products, which might take extensive amounts of time or might not be successful; and\n\u2022\nif we need to change manufacturers, FDA and comparable foreign regulators might require additional testing and compliance inspections prior to the new manufacturer being qualified for the production of our products.\nAny manufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in even more significant consequences, including:\n\u2022\nadditional delays, warning letters and fines;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or seizures and injunctions on sales;\n\u2022\nrefusal of the FDA to review pending applications;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nwithdrawals of previously approved marketing applications;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation; and\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims, civil penalties and criminal prosecutions.\nIn addition, the occurrence of manufacturing-related compliance issues could require subsequent withdrawal of the drug approval, reformulation of the drug product, additional testing or changes in labeling of the finished product. Any delay, interruption or cessation of production by our third-party manufacturers or strategic partners of our commercial products or product candidates, or their respective materials and components, as a result of any of the above factors or otherwise, may limit our ability to meet demand for commercial products and/or delay ongoing clinical trials, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have recently experienced changes in our management team, which may cause transition problems in our business.\nWe have recently experienced changes in our senior management team. Effective January 30, 2015, Carolyn J. Logan, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, retired. Thomas W. D\u2019Alonzo, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, was appointed Acting Chief Executive Officer, and William Bertrand, Jr., our Senior Vice President, Legal, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, was appointed Acting Chief Operating Officer. Additionally, effective November 5, 2014, Adam C. Derbyshire, our former Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration, and Chief Financial Officer, resigned, and Timothy J. Creech, Senior Vice President, Finance and Administrative Services, was appointed Acting Chief Financial Officer. We have not yet recruited permanent replacements for our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officers positions or determined whether the Chief Operating Officer position will become permanent.\nAny significant leadership change or executive management transition involves risk and failure to effectively transfer knowledge or otherwise conduct a smooth leadership transition process could hinder our strategic planning, execution and future performance, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Uncertainty regarding the timing or effectiveness of our management transition process may also harm our reputation and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nBecause our business and industry are highly regulated and scrutinized, any failure to follow applicable laws and regulations could result in litigation or government enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and industry are highly regulated and scrutinized, and subject to litigation risks, including product liability risks described above and the risk of government enforcement actions. We are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations, including but not limited to, health care \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, other state and federal laws and regulations, and, with respect to our international operations, U.S. laws such as the FCPA, local laws such as the UK Bribery Act 2010 and various foreign laws and regulations. While we have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure or alleged failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In recent years, there has been a heightened risk of governmental investigations into\npharmaceutical companies\u2019 sales and promotional practices for their products, including off-label uses, as evidenced by recent enforcement activity and/or pronouncements by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice and state attorneys general. Matters underlying governmental investigations may also be the subject of private litigation. See the risk factor entitled \u201cRegulatory approvals, even if granted, might entail ongoing requirements or restrictions on marketing. These requirements or restrictions, or inquiries into our marketing practices, could increase our expenses and limit revenue\u201d above, and Part I. Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for information about a pending federal government investigation concerning our sales and promotional practices for Xifaxan, Relistor and Apriso. If we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights in this investigation, or any other investigation or litigation, we could incur significant damages, fines or other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur research, development and manufacturing efforts, and those of third parties that research, develop and manufacture our products and product candidates on our behalf or in collaboration with us, involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, viruses, bacteria and various radioactive compounds, and are therefore subject to numerous U.S. and international environmental and safety laws and regulations and to periodic inspections for possible violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, we, and our collaborators and third-party manufacturers may also become subject to laws and regulations related to climate change, including the impact of global warming. The costs of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations are significant, and the costs of complying with climate change laws could also be significant. Any violations, even if inadvertent or accidental, of current or future environmental, safety or climate change laws or regulations could subject us to substantial fines, penalties or environmental remediation costs, or cause us to lose permits or other authorizations to operate affected facilities, any of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations governing our employees and contractors and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to our relationships with our employees and contractors are complex, extensive and fluid, and are subject to evolving interpretations by regulatory and judicial authorities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant damages, orders and/or fines and therefore could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations might fluctuate from period to period, and a failure to meet the expectations of investors or the financial community at large could result in a decline in our stock price.\nAs they have in the past, our results of operations might fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis due to, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe timing of regulatory approvals and product launches by us or competitors, including potential generic or over-the-counter competitors;\n\u2022\nthe level of revenue generated by commercialized products, including potential (1) increased purchases of inventory by wholesalers in anticipation of potential price increases or introductions of new dosages or bottle sizes, and subsequent lower than expected revenue as the inventory is used, or (2) decreased purchases of inventory by wholesalers (or wholesaler demands for increased product discounts) as a result of wholesalers holding a significant number of months of inventory of our key products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of any up-front payments that might be required in connection with any future acquisition of product rights;\n\u2022\nthe timing of milestone payments that might be required to our current or future licensors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our development and other costs in connection with ongoing product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe level of marketing and other expenses required in connection with product launches and ongoing product growth;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the acquisition and integration of businesses, assets, products and technologies; and\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific business and economic conditions.\nPlease also see the discussion of certain expected impacts to our results of operations from the level of inventory held by our wholesalers under Part II. Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Revenues.\u201d\nWe are a holding company that depends on cash flows from our wholly owned subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company conducting substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries, and all of our consolidated operating assets are held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, we rely on the operations of our subsidiaries to fund payments on our\nindebtedness. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from them. We and certain of our subsidiaries have entered into agreements limiting the ability of these subsidiaries to incur consensual encumbrances or restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, but these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nOur stock price has been extremely volatile and might continue to be, making owning our stock risky. Between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014, the price of a share of our common stock varied from a low of $37.52 to a high of $172.98.\nThe securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the performance of particular companies, including as a result of the current credit and economic crisis. In addition, the market prices of the common stock of many publicly traded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have in the past been and can in the future be expected to be especially volatile. Announcements of strategic transactions, prescription trends, technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, generic approvals, developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights, publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or our competitors, regulatory developments in both the United States and other countries, public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical products, economic and other external factors, period-to-period fluctuations in financial results, and stock market speculation regarding any of these factors, might have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover or changes in our current directors or management that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover or other change of control of us or the removal of our current directors and management, even if these events could be beneficial to stockholders. These provisions, which could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock, include the following:\n\u2022\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a stockholder, or stockholders, controlling a majority of our common stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders\u2019 meeting.\n\u2022\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\n\u2022\nOnly our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of directors, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n\u2022\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. These provisions might discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\nImplementing our plan to decrease wholesaler inventory levels will adversely affect our revenues.\nIn connection with the Audit Committee\u2019s review of Salix\u2019s financial statements and related disclosures, our Audit Committee and management determined that wholesaler inventory levels of XIFAXAN\u00ae 550, APRISO\u00ae and UCERIS\u00ae were greater than our current target of approximately three months. In order to reduce wholesaler inventory levels to meet this target by the end of 2015, we intend to sell to our wholesalers amounts of XIFAXAN\u00ae 550, APRISO\u00ae and UCERIS\u00ae that are less than end user demand until the target levels are reached. As a result, our revenue and cash flows were decreased in the fourth quarter of 2014 and may be decreased in the full year 2015, compared to prior periods. In addition, wholesalers may demand increased discounts on our products, which could further decrease revenue and cash flows, and it may take longer than anticipated to reach our target wholesaler inventory levels, which could result in decreased revenues and cash flows for a longer period than anticipated.\nThe SEC is conducting an investigation into possible securities law violations, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has retained outside counsel and is conducting an internal investigation of disclosures of inventory amounts in the distribution channel and related issues in press releases, on analyst calls, and in the Company\u2019s various SEC filings. That investigation includes certain accounting issues identified during the course of the investigation, including returns of Giazo, marketing fees paid to a wholesaler, and the Company\u2019s practices for recognizing revenue for shipments made to another wholesaler on or after October 1, 2013, and resulted in our restating our financial results for 2013 and the first three quarters of 2014. The Audit Committee has notified the SEC Enforcement Staff that it is conducting this investigation, and has had meetings with the SEC Enforcement Staff with respect to the Audit Committee\u2019s investigation. Moreover, counsel to the Audit Committee has voluntarily provided relevant documents to the SEC Enforcement Staff, and is cooperating with the SEC Enforcement Staff in the SEC\u2019s investigation. The Company has received information requests from the SEC and the Company expects to receive subpoenas for documents and testimony during the course of the SEC\u2019s investigation.\nWe cannot predict the outcome or the duration of the SEC investigation or any other legal proceedings or enforcement that may arise out of the SEC investigation. We also could be subjected to other lawsuits and could become the subject of other regulatory inquiries or investigations in addition to the SEC investigation now underway. If we are subject to adverse findings in any proceedings, we may be required to incur costs, or pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nResponding to the SEC investigation could divert management\u2019s attention from managing our day-to-day operations. Additionally, expenses that may arise from responding to the SEC investigation, management\u2019s review of responsive materials, any related litigation or other associated activities may be significant. Current and former employees, officers and directors may seek indemnification, advancement or reimbursement of expenses from us, including attorneys\u2019 fees, with respect to the current investigation or future proceedings related to this matter, if any such investigation or proceeding involves such employees, officers and directors personally. In addition, the SEC investigation may adversely affect our ability to obtain, or increase the cost of obtaining, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability and other types of insurance. These events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock\nWe have restated certain prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including shareholder litigation and governmental investigation, loss of investor confidence, and negative impacts on our stock price.\nAs discussed in our 2013 Form 10-K/A, we restated our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2014. The determination to restate these financial statements was made by our Audit Committee, after discussion with management and our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, following the identification of certain errors in its accounting, which are primarily associated with the timing of recognition of certain revenue, revenue-reducing returns and discounts, and expenses. As a result of these events, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including substantial unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and potential shareholder litigation and governmental investigation. We will incur additional substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of such litigation. Likewise, such events may cause a diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention. If we do not prevail in any such litigation or governmental investigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. In addition, the fact that we have completed a restatement may lead to a loss of investor confidence and have negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. In connection with the filing of this Form 10-K, management, including our Acting Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. Based on this evaluation using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework), management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 because we did not (1) establish and maintain adequate procedures and controls for (a) product returns and for the communications between our sales and accounting/finance functions to record agreed upon returns and (b) the recognition of revenue for sales to customers with FOB Destination shipping terms, (2) comply with established policies to properly obtain, evaluate, review and approve agreements with customers and (3) periodically review and assess our account classification policies in light of changes in our organization, management and personnel over time, and the effect of non-routine transactions. These control deficiencies also resulted in the restatement of our audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 and for the year then ended, and the restatement of the unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated financial information for the quarters ended March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014, and September 30, 2014, as discussed in further detail in our 2013 Form 10-K/A. We\nare actively engaged in developing remediation plans designed to address these material weaknesses. If we are unable to effectively remediate these material weaknesses or we are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, it could result in another material misstatement of our financial statements that would require a restatement, investor confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reports may be impacted, and the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company, and some of our current and former officers and directors, have been named as parties to various lawsuits arising out of or related to our disclosures regarding certain products, including with respect to disclosures concerning historic wholesaler inventory levels, business prospects and demand, reserves and internal controls and those lawsuits could adversely affect us, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nBeginning on November 7, 2014, three putative class action lawsuits were filed by shareholders of Salix, each of which generally alleges that Salix and certain former officers and directors violated the federal securities laws in connection with the Company\u2019s disclosures regarding certain products, including with respect to disclosures concerning historic wholesaler inventory levels, business prospects and demand, reserves and internal controls. Additional information regarding the lawsuits may be found in Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Securities Litigation.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits. The matters which led to our Audit Committee\u2019s review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. We and our current and former officers and directors may, in the future, be subject to additional litigation relating to such matters. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former officers and directors in connection with such lawsuits and any related litigation or settlements amounts. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits, and any other litigation that may be brought against us or our current or former officers and directors, could be time-consuming, result in significant expense and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees. An unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could exceed coverage provided under potentially applicable insurance policies, which is limited. Any such unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we could be required to pay damages or additional penalties or have other remedies imposed against us, or our current or former directors or officers, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 88811, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SLXP"}
