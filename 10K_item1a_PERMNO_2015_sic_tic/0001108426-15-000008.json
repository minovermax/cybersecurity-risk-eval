{"cik": "1108426", "company": "PNM RESOURCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe business and financial results of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below and in MD&A, Note 16, and Note 17. TNMP provides transmission and distribution services to REPs that provide electric service to consumers in TNMP\u2019s service territories. References to customers in the risk factors discussed below also encompass the customers of these REPs who are the ultimate consumers of electricity transmitted and distributed through TNMP\u2019s facilities.\nRegulatory Factors\nThe profitability of PNMR\u2019s utilities depends on being able to recover their costs through regulated rates and earn a fair return on invested capital. PNM and TNMP are in a period of significant capital expenditures. While increased capital investments and other costs are placing upward pressure on rates, energy efficiency and a sluggish New Mexico economy are reducing usage by customers.\nThe rates PNM charges its customers are regulated by the NMPRC and FERC. TNMP is regulated by the PUCT. The Company is in a period requiring significant capital investment and is projecting total construction expenditures for the years 2015-2019 to be $2,207.3 million. See Note 14. PNM and TNMP anticipate a trend toward increasing costs, for which it will have to seek regulatory recovery. These costs include or are related to:\n\u2022\nEnvironmental compliance expenditures\n\u2022\nThe proposed early retirement of SJGS Units 2 and 3 as part of a revised plan to comply with the regional haze provisions of the CAA, including treatment of their net book value at the date of retirement and costs of generation capacity to replace those units\n\u2022\nNew asset construction related to generation, transmission, and distribution systems necessary to provide electric service\n\u2022\nThe regulatory mandate to acquire power from renewable resources\n\u2022\nIncreased regulation related to nuclear safety\n\u2022\nFuel costs\n\u2022\nIncreased interest costs to finance capital investments\n\u2022\nDepreciation\nAt the same time costs are increasing, there are factors placing downward pressures on the demand for power, thereby reducing load growth and customer usage. These factors include:\n\u2022\nChanging customer behaviors, including increased emphasis on energy efficiency measures and utilization of alternative sources of power\n\u2022\nReduced new sources of demand\n\u2022\nReductions in costs of energy efficient technology\n\u2022\nUnpredictable weather patterns\n\u2022\nAdverse economic conditions\nIn 2014 and 2013, PNM experienced decreases in weather-normalized retail sales of 1.7% and 1.8%. The sales decreases reflect a continued sluggish economy in New Mexico. In particular, the Albuquerque metropolitan area continues to lag the nation in economic recovery. After several years of being relatively flat, New Mexico\u2019s employment showed modest growth in 2014 and\nA- 12\nonly modest growth is anticipated in the near future. Also, low population growth will result in low growth in the number of customers. In Texas, the drop in oil prices has impacted the economy although it remains relatively strong.\nThe combination of costs increasing relatively rapidly and the slowing of customer usage places upward pressure on the per unit prices that must be charged to recover costs. This upward pressure on unit prices could result in additional efforts by customers to reduce consumption through energy efficiency or to pursue self-generation or other alternative sources of power. Without timely cost recovery and the authorization to earn a reasonable return on invested capital, the Company\u2019s liquidity and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nUnder New Mexico law, utilities may propose the use of a future test year in establishing rates. As with any forward looking financial information, a future test year presents challenges that are inherent in the forecasting process. Forecasts of both operating and capital expenditures necessitate reliance on many assumptions concerning future conditions and operating results. Accordingly, if rate requests based on a future test year cannot be successfully supported, cash flows and results of operations may be negatively impacted. This could result from not being able to withstand challenges from regulators and intervenors regarding the utility\u2019s capability to make reasonable forecasts.\nThe coal supply contract that currently provides fuel for SJGS expires on December 31, 2017. Negotiations for a new coal supply contract, which are in process, could result in higher prices. In late December 2013, the expiration date of the coal supply contract for Four Corners was extended from 2016 to 2031. Coal costs are anticipated to increase approximately 30% at the inception of the new contract. The contract provides for pricing adjustments over its term based on economic indices. PNM currently recovers the cost of fuel for its generation facilities through its FPPAC. Although PNM believes costs under new coal supply arrangements would continue to be recovered through the FPPAC, there can be no assurance that full recovery would be allowed.\nPNMR\u2019s utilities are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that may significantly limit or affect their operations and financial results.\nCompliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those addressing climate change, air quality, CCBs, discharges of wastewater originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities, cooling water, and other matters, may result in increased capital, operating, and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emission obligations. These costs could include remediation, containment, civil liability, and monitoring expenses. The Company cannot predict how they would be affected if existing environmental laws and regulations were to be revised or reinterpreted, or if new environmental statutes and rules were to be adopted. See Note 16 and the Climate Change Issues subsection of the Other Issues Facing the Company section of MD&A.\nEPA, environmental advocacy groups, other organizations, and some other federal and state agencies are predicted to focus considerable attention on GHG from power generation facilities, including the role of those facilities in climate change. PNM depends on fossil-fueled generation for a significant share of its electricity. Therefore, it could be exposed to possible future GHG regulations imposed by New Mexico and/or the federal government. For example, as discussed in the Climate Change Issues subsection of the Other Issues Facing the Company section of MD&A, EPA has proposed its GHG NSPS rules for new sources, as well as modified and existing EGU\u2019s. Any such proposals that become regulations could result in additional operating restrictions on facilities and increased generation and compliance costs.\nCCBs from the operation of SJGS are currently being used in the reclamation of a surface coal mine. These CCBs consist of fly ash, bottom ash, and gypsum. Any new regulation that would affect the reclamation process, including mine use of CCBs being classified as hazardous waste by EPA, could significantly increase the costs of the disposal of CCBs and the costs of mine reclamation. See Note 16.\nA regulatory body may identify a site requiring environmental cleanup and designate PNM or TNMP as a responsible party. There is also uncertainty in quantifying exposure under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond PNM\u2019s or TNMP\u2019s control, may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines.\nBART determinations have been made for both SJGS and Four Corners under the program to address regional haze in the \u201cfour corners\u201d area, which would reduce the levels of NOx emitted at both plants. Significant capital expenditures will be required for the installation of control technology at both generating stations and operating costs would increase.PNMR and its operating subsidiaries may underestimate the costs of environmental compliance, liabilities, and litigation due to the uncertainty inherent in these matters. Although there is uncertainty about the timing and form of regulations regarding climate change, CCBs, and other power plant emissions, such regulations could have a material impact on operations. Timely regulatory recovery of\nA- 13\ncosts associated with any environmental-related regulations would be needed to maintain a strong financial and operational profile. The above factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nPNM has a case pending before the NMPRC requesting regulatory approvals necessary for PNM to comply with the regional haze requirements of the CAA pertaining to SJGS. Failure to obtain the approval of the NMPRC in this matter could impact PNM\u2019s ability to efficiently operate SJGS, which could have a negative impact on PNM\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSJGS, which currently comprises 28.9% of PNM\u2019s owned and leased generation capacity and is its largest generation resource, is subject to the CAA. In February 2013, PNM, NMED, and EPA agreed to pursue a revised plan regarding SJGS. In October 2014, EPA published its approval of NMED\u2019s RSIP, which requires the installation of SNCRs on SJGS Units 1 and 4 combined with the shutdown of SJGS Units 2 and 3. PNM believes significant progress is being made towards implementation of the RSIP. In order to retire San Juan Units 2 and 3, final binding agreements must be reached among the SJGS owners on a revised ownership structure of SJGS, as well as addressing continuing liabilities for reclamation, decommissioning, environmental, and other matters. The participants are attempting to agree on these items and are engaged in ongoing mediated negotiations, but binding agreements have not been reached.\nThe coal supply contract that currently provides fuel for SJGS expires on December 31, 2017. Coal supply has not been arranged for periods after the existing contract expires. In order for the participants to approve the restructuring of ownership in SJGS, they have indicated they need to obtain greater certainty regarding fuel supply for SJGS for the period after December 31, 2017. The remaining participants in SJGS are in the process of negotiating agreements concerning future fuel supply for SJGS. The date for negotiation of a transaction has been extended until May 1, 2015. However, it is possible that the participants may not be able to negotiate a new contract for coal supply or that a new contract for coal could result in higher prices, either of which could impact the restructuring process.\nPNM has a filing pending before the NMPRC that requests the regulatory approvals required to effectuate the RSIP. A public hearing on PNM\u2019s requests was held in January 2015 and PNM believes it justified that its requests provide the best alternative for New Mexico retail ratepayers in order to comply with the requirements of the CAA. Final approvals from the NMPRC are necessary to implement the RSIP. PNM believes that for the NMPRC to approve PNM\u2019s requests, the SJGS participants will have to reach binding agreements regarding restructuring ownership in SJGS. In the NMPRC proceeding, PNM has committed to reaching binding agreements on restructuring by May 1, 2015. For the participants to reach such agreements, it is likely that the remaining participants in SJGS will need to have completed negotiations regarding the coal supply for SJGS for periods after December 31, 2017.\nAdditional information regarding the RSIP, the restructuring negotiations, the request for NMPRC approvals, and coal supply is discussed in Note 16.\nPNM can provide no assurance that these requirements will be accomplished or that the NMPRC will approve PNM\u2019s requests. If NMPRC approval is not obtained, PNM may not be able to implement the RSIP. If the RSIP requirements ultimately are not implemented due to adverse or alternative regulatory, legislative, legal, or restructuring developments or other factors, PNM would need to pursue other alternatives to address compliance with the CAA. In such circumstances, PNM could be forced to temporarily or permanently cease operation of some or all of the SJGS units. If a shutdown was required, PNM would then have to acquire replacement power through short-term or open-market purchases in order to serve the needs of its customers. There can be no assurance that sufficient replacement power will be available to serve PNM\u2019s needs or, if available, what costs would be incurred. To the extent any additional costs incurred are not allowed to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process, PNM\u2019s financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIt is also possible that failure to reach a satisfactory agreement to restructure SJGS ownership, requirements to comply with the final BART determinations, the financial impact of possible future climate change regulation or legislation, if any, other environmental regulations, the result of litigation, the adequacy and timeliness of cost recovery mechanisms, and other business considerations, could jeopardize the economic viability of the plant or the ability of individual participants to continue participation in SJGS.\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to complex government regulation unrelated to the environment, which may have a negative impact on their businesses, financial position and results of operations.\nTo operate their businesses, PNMR, PNM, and TNMP are required to have numerous permits and approvals from a variety of regulatory agencies. Regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over the utilities include the NMPRC, NMED, PUCT, TCEQ, ERCOT,\nA- 14\nFERC, NRC, EPA, and NERC. Oversight by these agencies covers many aspects of the Company\u2019s utility operations including: location, construction, and operation of facilities; the purchase of power under long-term contracts; conditions of service; the issuance of securities; and rates charged to customers. FERC has issued a number of rules pertaining to preventing undue discrimination in transmission services and electric reliability standards.\nPNMR and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the impact on their business and operating results from future actions of any agency regulating the Company. Changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new ones could result in additional expenses and/or changes in business operations. In turn, operating results could be adversely impacted.\nOperational Factors\nCustomer electricity usage could be reduced by increases in prices charged and other factors. This could result in underutilization of PNM\u2019s generating capacity, as well as the capacities of PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s transmission and distribution systems. Should this occur, operating and capital costs might not be fully recovered, and financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nA number of factors influence customers\u2019 electricity purchases. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nRates charged by PNM and TNMP\n\u2022\nRates charged by REPs utilizing TNMP\u2019s facilities to deliver power\n\u2022\nEnergy efficiency initiatives\n\u2022\nAvailability and cost of alternative sources of power\n\u2022\nNational, regional, or local economic conditions\nThese factors and others may prompt customers to institute additional energy efficiency measures or take other actions that would result in lower power consumption. If customers bypass or underutilize PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s facilities through self-generation, renewable or other energy resources, technological change, or other measures, revenues would be negatively impacted.\nPNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s service territories include several military bases and federally funded national laboratories, as well as large industrial customers that have significant direct and indirect impacts on the local economies where they operate. The Company does not directly provide service to any of the military bases or national laboratories, but does provide service to large industrial customers. The Company\u2019s business could be hurt from the impacts on the local economies associated with these customer groups, as well as directly from the large industrial customers, for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nFederally-mandated base closures or significant curtailment of the activities at the bases or national laboratories\n\u2022\nClosure of industrial facilities or significant curtailment of their activities\nAnother factor that could negatively impact the Company is that proposals are periodically advanced in various localities to municipalize, or otherwise take over PNM\u2019s facilities, which PNM believes would require state legislative action to implement, or to establish new municipal utilities in areas currently served by PNM. For example, officials in the City of Santa Fe, New Mexico have indicated a desire to reduce the carbon footprint of the city, which could include exploring renewable resources dedicated to serve the city, a partnership with existing utilities, or the feasibility of a city-owned municipal electric utility. PNM is monitoring that situation. If any such initiative is successful, the result could be a material reduction in the usage of the facilities, a reduction in rate base, and reduced earnings.\nShould any of the above factors result in facilities being underutilized, the Company\u2019s financial position, operational results, and cash flows could be significantly impacted.\nCosts of decommissioning, remediation, and restoration of nuclear and fossil-fueled power plants, as well as related coal mines, could exceed the estimates of PNMR and PNM, which could negatively impact results of operations and liquidity.\nPNM has interests in a nuclear power plant, two coal-fired power plants, and several natural gas-fired power plants. PNM is obligated to pay for the costs of decommissioning its share of the power plants. PNM is also obligated to pay for its share of the costs of decommissioning the mines that supply coal to the coal-fired power plants. Likewise, other owners or participants are responsible for their shares of the decommissioning obligations and it is important to PNM that those parties fulfill their obligations. Rates charged by PNM to its customers, as approved by the NMPRC, include a provision for recovery of certain costs of decommissioning, remediation, and restoration. The NMPRC has established a cap on the amount of decommissioning costs for the surface coal mines that may be recovered from customers. PNM records estimated liabilities for its share of the legal\nA- 15\nobligations for decommissioning and reclamation. These estimates include many assumptions about future events and are inherently imprecise. In the event any of these costs exceed current estimates, results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThe financial performance of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP may be adversely affected if power plants and transmission and distribution systems do not operate reliably and efficiently.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance depends on the successful operation of PNM\u2019s generation assets, as well as the transmission and distribution systems of PNM and TNMP. Unscheduled or longer than expected maintenance outages, breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, temporary or permanent shutdowns to achieve environmental compliance, other performance problems with the electric generation assets, severe weather conditions, accidents and other catastrophic events, acts of war or terrorism, disruptions in the supply, quality, and delivery of fuel and water supplies, and other factors could result in PNM\u2019s load requirements being larger than available system generation capacity. Assured supplies of water are important for PNM\u2019s generating plants. Water in the southwestern United States is limited and there are conflicting claims regarding water rights. In addition, the \u201cfour corners\u201d region where two of PNM\u2019s power plants are located is prone to drought conditions, which could potentially affect the plants\u2019 water supplies. In addition, unplanned outages of generating units and extensions of scheduled outages occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Company\u2019s business. If these were to occur, PNM would be required to purchase electricity in either the wholesale market or spot market at the then-current market price. There can be no assurance that sufficient electricity would be available at reasonable prices, or available at all. The failure of transmission or distribution facilities may also affect PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s ability to deliver power. These potential generation, distribution, and transmission problems, and any service interruptions related to them, could result in lost revenues and additional costs.\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to information security breaches and risks of unauthorized access to their information and operational technology systems as well as physical threats to assets.\nThe Company faces the risk of physical and cyber attacks, both threatened and actual, against generation facilities, transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power, and information technology systems and network infrastructure, which could negatively impact the ability of the Company to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate facilities in the most efficient manner or at all.\nThe Company functions in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, some of which are deemed to be critical infrastructure under NERC guidelines. Certain of the Company\u2019s systems are interconnected with external networks. In the regular course of business, the utilities handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. PNM and TNMP are subject to the rules of various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information.\nIn the event a party desires to disrupt the bulk power or transmission systems in the United States, the Company\u2019s computer and operating systems could be subject to physical or cyber attack. Although the Company has implemented security measures, critical infrastructure, including information and operational technology systems, are vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access. A successful physical or cyber attack or other similar failure of the systems could impact the reliability of PNM\u2019s generation and PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s transmission and distribution systems, including the possible unauthorized shutdown of facilities. Such an event could lead to significant disruptions of business operations, including the Company\u2019s ability to generate, transport, and deliver power to serve customers, to bill customers, and to process other financial information. A major physical or cyber incident could lead to increased regulatory oversight, litigation, fines, other remedial action, and reputational damage. The costs incurred to investigate and remediate a physical or cyber security attack could be significant. If the Company\u2019s systems were to fail or be breached and not recovered in a timely way, critical business functions could be impaired and sensitive or confidential data could be compromised. A physical or cyber attack on the Company\u2019s critical infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP.\nThere are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities.\nPNM has a 10.2% undivided interest in PVNGS, including interests in Units 1 and 2 held under leases. PVNGS represents 16.8% of PNM\u2019s total owned and leased generating capacity. PVNGS is subject to environmental, health, and financial risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nThe ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel and water\n\u2022\nThe ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel\n\u2022\nDecommissioning of the plant\nA- 16\n\u2022\nSecuring the facilities against possible terrorist attacks\n\u2022\nUnscheduled outages due to equipment failures\nPNM maintains trust funds designed to provide adequate financial resources for decommissioning at the end of the expected life of the PVNGS units. However, if the units are decommissioned before their planned date, these funds may prove to be insufficient. PNM also has external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some risks. However, it is possible that liabilities associated with nuclear operations could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. See Note 16.\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. Events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the NRC to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities, including PVNGS. As a result of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunamis that caused significant damage to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan, various industry organizations are working to analyze information from the Japan incident and develop action plans for nuclear power plants in the United States. Additionally, the NRC has been performing its own independent review of the events at Fukushima Daiichi, including a review of the agency\u2019s processes and regulations in order to determine whether the agency should promulgate additional regulations and possibly make more fundamental changes to the NRC\u2019s system of regulation. PNM cannot predict when or if the NRC will complete its formal actions as a result of its review. However, PVNGS expects to spend approximately $40 million for capital enhancements to the plant over the next two years in addition to the approximately $80 million that has already been spent on capital enhancements as of December 31, 2014. PNM\u2019s share of these enhancements would be 10.2%, substantially all of which are included in PNM\u2019s current projection of capital expenditures. PNM cannot predict whether these amounts will increase or whether additional financial and/or operational requirements on PVNGS may be imposed.\nIn the event of noncompliance with its requirements, the NRC has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit or civil penalties, or both, depending upon the NRC\u2019s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Increased costs resulting from penalties, a heightened level of scrutiny, and/or implementation of plans to achieve compliance with NRC requirements could adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of PNMR and PNM. Although PNM has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at PVNGS, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect PNM\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures and/or increase operating costs.\nDemand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity in the open market or building additional generation facilities.\nPNM is obligated to supply power to retail customers and certain wholesale customers. At peak times, power demand could exceed PNM\u2019s available generation capacity. Market forces, competitive forces, or adverse regulatory actions may require PNM to purchase capacity on the open market or build additional generation capabilities. Regulators or market conditions may not permit PNM to pass all of these purchases or construction costs on to customers. If that occurs, PNM may not be able to fully recover these costs. Or, there may be a lag between when costs are incurred and when regulators permit recovery in customers\u2019 rates. These situations could have negative impacts on results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral Economic and Weather Factors\nGeneral economic conditions of the nation and/or specific areas can affect the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers. Economic recession or downturn may result in decreased consumption by customers and increased bad debt expense, and could also negatively impact suppliers, all of which could negatively impact the Company.\nEconomic activity is a key factor in PNMR subsidiaries\u2019 performance. Decreased economic activity can lead to declines in energy consumption, which could adversely affect future revenues, earnings, and growth. Higher unemployment rates, both in the Company\u2019s service territories and nationwide, could result in commercial customers ceasing operations and lower levels of income for residential customers. These customers might then be unable to pay their bills on time, which could increase bad debt expense and negatively impact results of operations and cash flows. Economic conditions also impact the supply and/or cost of commodities and materials needed to construct or acquire utility assets or make necessary repairs.\nA- 17\nThe operating results of PNMR and its operating subsidiaries fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis as well as being affected by weather conditions, including regional drought.\nElectric generation, transmission, and distribution are generally seasonal businesses that vary with the demand for power. With power consumption typically peaking during the hot summer months, revenues traditionally peak during that period. As a result, quarterly operating results of PNMR and its operating subsidiaries vary throughout the year. In addition, PNMR and its operating subsidiaries have historically had lower revenues resulting in lower earnings when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net earnings, and cash flows of the Company.\nDrought conditions in New Mexico, especially in the \u201cfour corners\u201d region, where SJGS and Four Corners are located, may affect the water supply for PNM\u2019s generating plants. If inadequate precipitation occurs in the watershed that supplies that region, PNM may have to decrease generation at these plants. This would require PNM to purchase power to serve customers and/or reduce the ability to sell excess power on the wholesale market and reduce revenues. Drought conditions or actions taken by regulators or legislators could limit PNM\u2019s supply of water, which would adversely impact PNM\u2019s and PNMR\u2019s business. Although PNM has in place supplemental contracts and voluntary shortage sharing agreements with tribes and other water users in the \u201cfour corners\u201d region, PNM cannot be certain these contracts will be enforceable in the event of a major drought or that it will be able to renew these contracts in the future.\nTNMP\u2019s service areas are exposed to extreme weather, including high winds, drought, flooding, and periodic hurricanes. Extreme weather conditions, particularly high winds and severe thunderstorms, also occur periodically in PNM\u2019s service areas. These severe weather events can physically damage TNMP\u2019s and PNM\u2019s owned facilities. Any such occurrence both disrupts the ability to deliver energy and increases costs. Extreme weather can also reduce customers\u2019 usage and demand for energy. These factors could negatively impact results of operations and cash flows.\nFinancial Factors\nPNMR may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or distributions to PNMR.\nPNMR is a holding company and has no operations of its own. PNMR\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock primarily depends on the net income and cash flows of PNM and TNMP and their capacity to pay upstream dividends or distributions. Prior to providing funds to PNMR, PNM and TNMP have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and, in the case of PNM, preferred stock dividends.\nThe NMPRC has placed certain restrictions on the ability of PNM to pay dividends to PNMR, including that PNM cannot pay dividends that cause its debt rating to fall below investment grade. The NMPRC has also restricted PNM from paying dividends in any year, as determined on a rolling four-quarter basis, in excess of net earnings without prior NMPRC approval. PNM is permitted to pay dividends to PNMR from prior equity contributions made by PNMR. Additionally, PNM has various financial covenants that limit the transfer of assets, through dividends or other means.\nFurther, the ability of PNMR to declare dividends depends upon:\n\u2022\nThe extent to which cash flows will support dividends\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s financial circumstances and performance\n\u2022\nNMPRC\u2019s and PUCT\u2019s decisions in various regulatory cases currently pending and which may be docketed in the future\n\u2022\nConditions imposed by the NMPRC or PUCT\n\u2022\nThe effect of federal regulatory decisions and legislative acts\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions in the United States and in the Company\u2019s service areas\n\u2022\nFuture growth plans and the related capital requirements\n\u2022\nOther business considerations\nA- 18\nDisruption in the credit and capital markets may impact the Company\u2019s strategy and ability to raise capital.\nPNMR and its subsidiaries rely on access to both short-term and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations, including energy infrastructure investments and new projects. In general, the Company relies on its short-term credit facilities as the initial source to finance construction expenditures. This results in increased borrowings under the facilities over time. The Company is currently projecting total construction expenditures for the years 2015-2019 to be $2,207.3 million. If PNMR or its operating subsidiaries are not able to access capital at competitive rates, or at all, PNMR\u2019s ability to finance capital requirements and implement its strategy will be limited. Disruptions in the credit markets, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s access to capital, could be caused by:\n\u2022\nAn economic recession\n\u2022\nDeclines in the health of the banking sector generally, or the failure of specific banks who are parties to the Company\u2019s credit facilities\n\u2022\nDeterioration in the overall health of the utility industry\n\u2022\nThe bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company\n\u2022\nWar, terrorist or cybersecurity attacks, or threatened attacks\nIf the Company\u2019s cash flow and credit and capital resources are insufficient to fund capital expenditure plans, the Company may be forced to delay important capital investments, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital, or restructure debt. In addition, insufficient cash flows and capital resources may result in reductions of credit ratings. This could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would result in an increase in the interest rates applicable under the Company\u2019s credit facilities. The Company\u2019s cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient to pay interest and principal on debt in the future. If that should occur, the Company\u2019s capital raising or debt restructuring measures may be unsuccessful or inadequate to meet scheduled debt service obligations. This could cause the Company to default on its obligations and further impair liquidity.\nReduction in credit ratings or changing rating agency requirements could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth, strategy, business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP cannot be sure that any of their current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be put under review for a downgrade, lowered, or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. Downgrades or changing requirements could result in increased borrowing costs due to higher interest rates in future financings, a smaller potential pool of investors, and decreased funding sources. Such conditions also could require the provision of additional support in the form of letters of credit and cash or other collateral to various counterparties.\nDeclines in values of marketable securities held in trust funds for pension and other postretirement benefits and in the NDT could result in sustained increases in costs and funding requirements for those obligations, which may affect operational results.\nThe Company targets 21% of its pension trust funds and 70% of its trust funds for other postretirement benefits to be invested in marketable equity securities. Over one-half of funds held in the NDT are typically invested in marketable equity securities. Declines in market values could result in increased funding of the trusts as well as the recognition of losses as impairments for the NDT and additional expense for the benefit plans.\nImpairments of goodwill and long-lived assets of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP annually evaluate their recorded goodwill for impairment. They also assess long-lived assets whenever indicators of impairment exist. Factors that affect the long-term value of these assets as well as other economic and market conditions could result in impairments. Significant impairments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nPNM\u2019s PVNGS leases describe certain events, including \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d and \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d, the occurrence of which could require PNM to take ownership of the underlying assets and pay the lessors for the assets.\nThe \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d generally relate to casualties, accidents, and other events at PVNGS, including the occurrence of specified nuclear events, which would severely adversely affect the ability of the operating agent, APS, to operate, and the ability of PNM to earn a return on its interests in PVNGS. The \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d consist primarily of legal and regulatory changes (such as issuance by the NRC of specified violation orders, changes in law making the sale and leaseback transactions illegal, or\nA- 19\nchanges in law making the lessors liable for nuclear decommissioning obligations). PNM believes that the probability of such \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d or \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d occurring is remote for the following reasons: (1) to a large extent, prevention of \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d and some \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d is within the control of the PVNGS participants through the general PVNGS operational and safety oversight process; and (2) other \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d would involve a significant change in current law and policy. PNM is unaware of any proposals pending or being considered for introduction in Congress, or in any state legislative or regulatory body that, if adopted, would cause any of those events. See Note 7.\nGovernance Factors\nProvisions of PNMR\u2019s organizational documents, as well as several other statutory and regulatory factors, will limit another party\u2019s ability to acquire PNMR and could deprive PNMR\u2019s shareholders of the opportunity to receive a takeover premium for shares of PNMR\u2019s common stock.\nPNMR\u2019s restated articles of incorporation and by-laws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of discouraging persons from acquiring large blocks of PNMR\u2019s common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control of PNMR. The material provisions that may have such an effect include:\n\u2022\nAuthorization for the Board to issue PNMR\u2019s preferred stock in series and to fix rights and preferences of the series (including, among other things, voting rights and preferences with respect to dividends and other matters)\n\u2022\nAdvance notice procedures with respect to any proposal other than those adopted or recommended by the Board\n\u2022\nProvisions specifying that only a majority of the Board, the chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer, or holders of at least one-tenth of all of PNMR\u2019s shares entitled to vote may call a special meeting of stockholders\nUnder the New Mexico Public Utility Act, NMPRC approval is required for certain transactions that may result in PNMR\u2019s change in control or exercise of control, including ownership of 10% or more of PNMR\u2019s voting stock. Certain acquisitions of PNMR\u2019s outstanding voting securities also require FERC approval.", "PERMNO": 55511, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "PNM"}
