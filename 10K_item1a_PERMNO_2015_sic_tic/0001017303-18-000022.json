{"cik": "1017303", "company": "TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, as well as other disclosures in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, because they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks not known to us now or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nWe assume no obligation (and specifically disclaim any such obligation) to update these Risk Factors or any other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year and are likely to continue to vary due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results, the market price of our common stock will likely decline. Fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those identified throughout this \"Risk Factors\" section:\n\u25cf\ndelays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced products and consumables and the generation of sales from those products;\n\u25cf\nthe geographic distribution of our sales;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our products, both domestically and internationally;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment of new competitive products by others;\n\u25cf\nour responses to price competition;\n\u25cf\nour level of research and development activities;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the amount that we spend to develop, acquire or license new products, consumables, technologies or businesses;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the amount we spend to promote our products and services;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the cost of satisfying our warranty obligations and servicing our installed base of products;\n\u25cf\navailability of third-party components at reasonable prices;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates affecting returns on cash balances and investments, that affect customer demand;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations of world-wide oil and gas prices;\n\u25cf\nsevere weather events (such as hurricanes) that can disrupt or interrupt the operation of our customers or suppliers facilities; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting rules.\nDue to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this report, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be an indicator of future performance.\nOur revenue and profitability depend on our ability to continue to develop, on a timely basis, new products and technologies which are free from hardware or software anomalies and cannot be fraudulently manipulated.\nThe success of newer products such as the AccuDate\u2122 restaurant solutions terminals is dependent on how quickly customers in the related markets accept them given the very little market penetration these products have experienced since they are new and innovative and have limited competition. Additionally, the success of innovative technology, such as printing coupons and promotions at the slot machine using EPICENTRAL\u2122, is dependent on our casino customers' acceptance of such technology. While we have designed EPICENTRAL\u2122 to support our customers' existing investment in our Epic 950\u00ae thermal casino printers, such acceptance may nevertheless only build gradually over time or not at all. Delays in acceptance by our customers of new technologies may adversely affect our operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to adapt our capabilities and processes to meet the demands of producing new and innovative products. Because our newer products contain software and are generally more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past, we must continually refine our capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation. If we cannot efficiently adapt our infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations in a timely manner, our business could be negatively impacted.\nIn the lottery market, we have been dependent on sales to one large customer; the loss of this customer or reduction in orders from this customer could materially affect our sales.\nSales to IGT have represented a material percentage of our net sales since 1995. A reduction, delay or cancellation in orders from this customer, including reductions or delays due to market, economic, or competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations.\nSignificant developments stemming from the recent change U.K.'s referendum on membership in the EU could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or EU. This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Our business in the United Kingdom, the EU, and worldwide could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom's referendum. There are many ways in which our business could be affected, only some of which we can identify as of the date of this annual report.\nThe referendum, and the likely withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU that it triggers, has caused and, along with events that could occur in the future as a consequence of the United Kingdom's withdrawal, including the possible breakup of the United Kingdom, may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets, including in global currency and debt markets. This volatility could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the United Kingdom, Europe or globally, which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom.\nInfringement on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage, and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.\nThird parties may claim that we violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third party's patent or other intellectual property right, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method, if possible, to accomplish our objectives. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel. If such claims are successful, they could result in costly judgments or settlements. Refer to Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\" for discussion surrounding litigation we were involved in regarding alleged misappropriation of unspecified trade secrets and confidential information.\nGeneral economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to general economic conditions. Uncertainty or negative trends in U.S. or international economic and investment climates could adversely affect our business. If these negative trends were to occur, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers which could result in production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, create unabsorbed costs due to lower net sales, and ultimately decrease our net sales and profitability including write-downs of assets.\nWe rely on distributors and resellers to sell our products and services.\nWe use a variety of distribution channels, including OEMs and distributors, to market and sell our products and services. We may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among our various sales channels.\nOur dependence upon distributors and resellers exposes us to numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\nloss of channel and the ability to bring new products to market;\n\u25cf\nconcentration of credit risk, including disruption in distribution should the distributors and / or resellers' financial condition deteriorate;\n\u25cf\nreduced visibility to end user demand and pricing issues which makes forecasting more difficult;\n\u25cf\ndistributors or resellers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing, payment and product delivery schedules; and\n\u25cf\ndirect competition should a distributor or reseller decide to manufacture printers internally or source printers from a competitor.\nWe cannot guarantee that resellers will not reduce, delay or eliminate purchases from us, which could have a material adverse effect upon the business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have outsourced substantially all of the assembly of our printers and terminals to three contract manufacturers and will be dependent on them for the manufacturing of such products. A failure by these contract manufacturers, or any disruption in such manufacturing or the flow of product from these manufacturers, may adversely affect our business results.\nIn an effort to achieve additional cost savings and operation benefits, we have continued to outsource the manufacturing and assembly of our printers and terminals to contract manufacturers in Asia. Approximately 80% of our printer and terminal manufacturing is conducted by one third party manufacturer in Asia, and an additional 19% is conducted by two other third party manufacturers in Asia.\nHowever, to the extent we rely on a third-party service provider for manufacturing services, we may incur increased business continuity risks. We will no longer be able to exercise control over the assembly of certain of our products or any related operations or processes, including the internal controls associated with operations and processes conducted and the quality of our products assembled by contract manufacturers. If we are unable to effectively manage and oversee our outsourcing strategy, we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, if any of our contract manufacturers experiences business difficulties or fails to meet our manufacturing needs, then we may be unable to meet production requirements, may lose revenue and may not be able to maintain relationships with our customers. Without the contract manufacturers continuing to manufacture our products and the continuing operation of the contract manufacturers' facilities, we will have limited means for the final assembly of a majority of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility, which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nThe increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in foreign jurisdictions may lead to an increase in reputational risk.\nAlthough we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate, this insurance does not cover all possible situations. In addition, the business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact, both short-term and long-term, on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them.\nThe contract manufacturers have access to our intellectual property, which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property.\nPolitical, social or economic instability in regions in which our manufacturers are located, could cause disruptions in trade, including exports to the U.S.\nA significant portion of our printers and terminals are manufactured by contract manufacturers overseas and are exported to the U.S. Any such disruption in trade, including exports to the U.S., could adversely affect our business results. Events that could cause disruptions to such exports to the U.S. include:\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of additional trade law provisions or regulations;\n\u25cf\nreliance on a limited number of shipping and air carriers who may experience capacity issues that adversely affect our ability to ship inventory in a timely manner or for an acceptable cost;\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports;\n\u25cf\neconomic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including inflation and recession);\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies;\n\u25cf\nsignificant labor disputes, such as dock strikes;\n\u25cf\nsignificant delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations; and\n\u25cf\nfinancial or political instability in any of the countries in which our printers and terminals are manufactured.\nWe source some of our component parts and consumable products from sole source suppliers; any disruptions may impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nOur products rely on certain key components from third party or sole source suppliers. We do not have guaranteed supply contracts with any of our component suppliers, and our suppliers could delay shipments, increase prices or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time. A disruption in the supply of such component parts and consumable products could delay our production and/or the release of our new products and hinder our ability to meet our commitments to customers. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for the components, sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products. Any of these events could result in lost sales, reduced gross margins or damage to our end-customer relationships, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe sell a significant portion of our products internationally and purchase important components from foreign suppliers. These circumstances create a number of risks.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the United States. Shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales. Risks associated with sales and purchases outside the United States include:\n\u25cf\nfluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales, or increase costs of purchasing, in foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nforeign governments may impose burdensome tariffs, quotas, taxes, trade barriers or capital flow restrictions;\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our foreign assets at risk;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets; and\n\u25cf\npotentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries, such as China, may limit recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories.\nIf tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, such as those recently proposed by the President of the United States, are implemented, our cost of raw materials may increase, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe obtain raw materials, including stainless steel and aluminum used in the production of some of our printer products from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources. The President of the United States recently announced a proposal to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum through the issuance of an executive order. If implemented, such tariffs may cause an increase in costs for all domestic entities, including TransAct, that purchase imported steel or aluminum or products manufactured using such materials. Because steel and aluminum are raw materials used in a wide-range of our printer products, a broad based cost increase would result in an increase in our cost of goods sold, which may require us to increase prices for some of our products. However, an inability by us to pass such price increases through to our customers, or an inability of our suppliers to meet our raw material requirements, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe effect of comprehensive U.S. tax reform legislation on us, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain.\nIn December of 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). Among a number of significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules, the Tax Act reduces the marginal U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limits the deduction for net interest expense, shifts the United States toward a more territorial tax system, and imposes new rules to combat erosion of the U.S. federal income tax base. We are still evaluating the effects of the Tax Act on us and there are a number of uncertainties and ambiguities as to the interpretation and application of many of the provisions in the Tax Act. In the absence of guidance on these issues, we will use what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in interpreting and applying the Tax Act for purposes of determining our cash tax liabilities and results of operations, which may change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance and as the interpretation of the Tax Act evolves over time. It is possible that the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\" could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from the interpretations and assumptions that we previously made, which could have an adverse effect on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations and financial condition. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations, as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nWe face risks associated with manufacturing forecasts.\nIf we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays, which could cause us to lose orders or customers and result in lower net sales. We currently use a rolling 12-month forecast based primarily on our anticipated product orders and our product order history to help determine our requirements for components and materials. It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead-time required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials.\nLead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, the size of the order, contract terms, and demand for each component at a given time. If we underestimate our requirements, we may have inadequate manufacturing capacity or inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and net sales. If we overestimate our requirements, we could have excess inventory of parts. In addition, delays in the manufacturing of our products could cause us to lose orders or customers.\nOur success will depend on our ability to sustain and manage growth.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a growth strategy. Assuming this growth occurs, it will require the expansion of customer relationships in international markets, the successful development and marketing of new products for our existing and new markets, expanded internal sales, customer service and support, and the continued implementation and improvement of our operational, financial and management information systems.\nTo the extent that we seek growth through acquisitions, our ability to manage our growth will also depend on our ability to integrate businesses that have previously operated independently. We may not be able to achieve this integration without encountering difficulties or experiencing the loss of key employees, customers or suppliers. It may be difficult to design and implement effective financial controls for combined operations and differences in existing controls for each business may result in weaknesses that require remediation when the financial controls and reporting functions are combined. As we pursue acquisitions, we may incur legal, accounting and other transaction related expenses for unsuccessful acquisition attempts that could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy, or that we can successfully manage expanded operations, if they occur. As we expand, we may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion. Failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete in highly competitive markets, which are likely to become more competitive. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements.\nWe face significant competition in developing and selling our printers, terminals, software, transaction supplies and services. Our principal competitors have substantial marketing, financial, development and personnel resources. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to provide:\n\u25cf\ntechnologically advanced products that satisfy the user demands;\n\u25cf\nsuperior customer service;\n\u25cf\nhigh levels of quality and reliability; and\n\u25cf\ndependable and efficient distribution networks.\nWe cannot ensure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. Some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products. Any of these factors could reduce our earnings.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of which could materially impact our business.\nOur future success will depend in significant part upon the continued service of certain key management and other personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel. The loss of either Bart C. Shuldman, the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, or Steven A. DeMartino, the Company's President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, or the loss of certain groups of key employees, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to enforce our patents or if it is determined that we infringe patents held by others it could damage our business.\nProsecuting and defending patent lawsuits is very expensive. We are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property, which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop. These factors could cause us to become involved in new patent litigation in the future. The expense of prosecuting or defending these future lawsuits could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we were to lose a patent lawsuit in which another party is asserting that our products infringe its patents, we would likely be prohibited from marketing those products and could also be liable for significant damages. Either or both of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we lose a patent lawsuit in which we are claiming that another party's products are infringing our patents and thus, are unable to enforce our patents, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties' rights, we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our own intellectual property rights. Whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others, intellectual property litigation can be complex, costly, protracted, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief, and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain. Thus, any adverse determinations in this type of litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs. During the course of these lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could harm the market price of our stock.\nThe inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation, and our competitive position may be materially damaged.\nOur intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages. Copyrights, patents, trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of our products or, without authorization, to obtain and use information which we regard as trade secrets.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors, such as:\n\u25cf\nchanges in our business, operations or prospects;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our relationships with our customers;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of new products or services by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncement or completion of acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in existing or adoption of additional government regulations;\n\u25cf\nunfavorable or reduced analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf\nprevailing domestic and international market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market may experience significant price fluctuations year-to-year. Broad market fluctuations, general economic conditions and specific conditions in the industries in which we operate may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nLimited trading volume and a reduction in analyst coverage of our common stock may contribute to its price volatility.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the average daily trading volume for our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market was approximately 18,000 shares. We are uncertain whether a more active trading market in our common stock will develop. In addition, many investment banks no longer find it profitable to provide securities research on micro-cap and small-cap companies. As a result, relatively small trades may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, which could increase the volatility and depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock in public or private offerings, and we may also issue additional shares of our common stock to finance future acquisitions. Shares of our common stock are also available for future sale pursuant to stock options and other equity awards that we have granted to our employees, and in the future we may grant additional stock options and other forms of equity compensation to our employees. Sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings.\nIf market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, a valuation allowance may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets.\nWe currently have deferred tax assets, which may be used to reduce taxable income in the future. We assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, and if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized, an income tax valuation allowance is recorded. If market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, or there is a change to applicable tax rules, future assessments may result in a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable. As a result, we may need to establish a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that current laws, or any laws enacted in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.\nOur business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures, military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism.\nOur business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures, military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism. It is possible that terrorist attacks could be directed at important locations for the gaming industry. Heightened security measures and other efforts to combat terrorism may also have an adverse effect on the gaming industry by reducing tourism. Any of these developments could also negatively affect the general economy and consumer confidence. Any downturn in the economy or in the gaming industry in particular could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, heightened security measures may cause certain governments to restrict the import/export of goods, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to buy/sell goods.\nFluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling and exploration activities by oil and gas companies and our revenue in our Printrex market. If oil and gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our Printrex products could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our Printrex products depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for drilling and exploratory activities, which are affected by short-term and long-term trends in oil and gas prices, including current and anticipated oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices, as well as the level of drilling and exploration, historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be highly volatile. If oil and gas prices continue to remain low or decline further, or if there is a further reduction in drilling and exploration activities, the demand for our Printrex products could be materially and adversely affected.\nSecurity breaches, cyber-attacks, or other disruptions could expose us to liability and affect our business and reputation.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We collect, store, and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information in connection with business operations. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack by third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, disgruntled current or former employees, and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our extensive security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee error or malfeasance. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. If our systems become compromised, we may not promptly discover the intrusion. Like other companies in our industry, we have experienced attacks to our data and systems, including malware and computer viruses that we have been able to detect and eliminate. If our systems fail or are breached or disrupted, we could lose product sales, and suffer reputational damage and loss of customer confidence. Such incidents would require notification to affected individuals, and may result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Any one of these events could cause our business to be materially harmed and our results of operations to be adversely impacted.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business. Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 83910, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "TACT"}
