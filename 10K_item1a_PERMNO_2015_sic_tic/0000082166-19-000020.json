{"cik": "82166", "company": "RAVEN INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY\nThe Company's business is subject to many risks, which by their nature are unpredictable or unquantifiable and may be unknown. In an attempt to provide you with information on potential risks the Company may encounter, the Company has provided below, what it believes are the most significant risks the Company could potentially face, based on its knowledge, experience, information and assumptions. The risks provided below should be assessed contemporaneously with other information contained in this Form 10-K, including Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d the risks and uncertainties addressed under \"Forward-Looking Statements\" on page 29, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 39, and other information presented in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks contained herein, as well as other statements in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements and, as such, are uncertain. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. The indeterminate nature of risk factors makes them subject to change, and certain risks and uncertainties could potentially cause material changes to actual results. Some of these risks may affect the entire Company, where others may only affect particular segments of the Company's business, or may have no material affect at all.\nThe Company, except as required by law, disclaims any obligation to update or revise the risk factors contained herein, regardless of changes, whether as a result of new information, developments or otherwise. The risks provided in this Form 10-K and in other documents filed with the SEC are not exclusive in nature and, as such, there are other potential risks and uncertainties that the Company is not aware of, or does not presently consider material in nature that could feasibly cause actual results to vary materially from expectations.\nWeather conditions or natural disasters could affect certain Company markets, such as agriculture, construction, geomembrane installation, or the Company's primary manufacturing facilities.\nThe Company's Applied Technology Division is largely dependent on the ability of farmers, agricultural service providers, and custom applicators to purchase agricultural equipment, including its products. If such farmers, agricultural service providers, or custom applicators experience weather conditions or natural disasters resulting in unfavorable field conditions, crop prices, or farm incomes, sales in the Applied Technology Division may be adversely affected.\nWeather conditions and natural disasters may also adversely affect sales in the Company's Engineered Films Division. To the extent weather conditions or natural disasters impact agriculture, construction, or geomembrane installation activity, sales of the division's plastic sheeting would likely decrease.\nSeasonal and weather-related variation could also affect quarterly results. If expected sales are deferred in a fiscal quarter and inventory has been built while operating expenses incurred, financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s primary manufacturing facilities for each of its operating divisions are located on contiguous properties in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. If weather-related natural disasters such as tornadoes or flooding were to occur in the area, such conditions could impede the manufacturing and shipping of products and potentially adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales, transactions processing, and financial reporting. The Company has disaster recovery plans in place to manage the Company\u2019s risks to these vulnerabilities but these measures may not be adequate, implemented properly, or executed timely to ensure that the Company\u2019s operations are not disrupted. Such consequences could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe loss, disruption, or material change in the Company's business relationship with single source suppliers for particular materials, components or services, could cause a disruption in supply, or substantial increase in cost of any such products or services, and therefore could result in harm to the Company's sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company obtains certain materials, components, or services from suppliers that serve as the only source of supply, or that supply the majority of the Company\u2019s requirements of the particular material, component, or service. While these materials, components, services, or suitable replacements, could potentially be sourced from other suppliers, in the event of a disruption or loss of supply of relevant materials, components, or services for any reason, the Company may not be able to immediately find alternative sources of supply, or if found, may not be found on similar terms. If the Company\u2019s relationship with any of these single source suppliers became challenged, or is terminated, the Company could have difficulty replacing these sources without causing disruption to the business.\nPrice fluctuations in, and shortages of, raw materials could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to sustain and grow earnings.\nThe Company's Engineered Films Division utilizes significant amounts of polymeric resin, the cost of which depends upon market prices for natural gas and oil and other market forces. These prices are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the Company's control. Although the Engineered Films Division is sometimes able to pass on price increases to its customers, significant variations in the cost of polymeric resins can affect the Company's operating results from period to period. Success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. Unusual supply disruptions, such as one caused by a natural disaster, could cause suppliers to invoke \"force majeure\" clauses in their supply agreements, causing shortages in supply of material. If the Company is not able to fully offset the effects of adverse availability of materials or higher costs, financial results could be adversely affected, which in turn could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nElectronic components used by both the Applied Technology Division and Aerostar Division are sometimes in short supply, which may impact the ability to meet customer demand or provide products at a price the customer prefers. If a supplier of raw materials or electronic components were to significantly increase pricing or was unable to deliver due to shortage or financial difficulty, any of the Company's segments could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in commodity prices can increase the Company's costs and decrease sales.\nAgricultural income levels are affected by agricultural commodity prices (primarily corn, beans, and grains) and input costs. As a result, changes in commodity prices or input costs that reduce agricultural income levels could have a negative effect on the ability of farmers and their service providers to purchase the Company's precision agriculture products manufactured by its Applied Technology Division.\nExploration for oil and natural gas fluctuates with their price and energy market conditions are subject to volatility. Certain plastic sheeting manufactured and sold by the Engineered Films Division is sold as pit and pond liners to contain water used in the drilling processes for these energy commodities. Lower prices for oil and natural gas could reduce exploration activities and demand for its products.\nFilm manufacturing uses polymeric resins, which can be subject to changes in price as the cost of oil or natural gas changes. Accordingly, volatility in oil and natural gas prices may negatively affect raw material costs and cost of goods sold and potentially cause the division to increase prices, which could adversely affect sales and/or profitability.\nFailure to develop and market new technologies and products could impact the Company's competitive position and have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company's operating results in Applied Technology, Engineered Films, and Aerostar depend upon the ability to renew the pipeline of new technologies and products and to bring these to market. This ability could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development projects, obtain relevant regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products and services. Because of the lengthy development process, technological challenges, and competition, there can be no assurance that any of the products the Company is currently developing, or could begin to develop in the future, will achieve commercial success. Technical advancements in products may also increase the risk of product failure, increasing product returns or warranty claims and settlements. In addition, sales of the Company's new products could replace sales of some of its current products, offsetting the benefit of a successful new product introduction.\nFailure to develop and maintain partnerships, alliances, and other distribution or supplier relationships could adversely impact the Company's financial results.\nIn certain areas of the Company\u2019s business, continued success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with other industry participants, such as original equipment manufacturers, ag retailers, dealers and distributors. If the Company fails to develop and maintain such relationships, or if there is disruption of current business relationships due to actions of the Company, the ability to effectively market and sell certain products could be harmed. The Company\u2019s relationships with other industry participants are complex and multifaceted, and evolve over time. Often, these relationships contribute to substantial ongoing business and operations in particular markets; therefore, changes in these relationships could have an adverse impact on sales and revenue.\nAdditionally, the Company uses dealer/distributor networks, some of which are affiliated with strategic and industry partners. Enlisting and retaining qualified dealers/distributors and training them in the use and selling of product offerings requires substantial time and resources. If the Company were to lose a significant dealer or distributor relationship, and were forced to identify new channels, the time and expense of training new dealers or distributors may make new-product introduction difficult. This may\nhinder end-user sales and adoption, which could result in decreased revenues. Additionally, the interruption of dealer coverage within specific regions or markets could cause difficulties in marketing, selling or servicing the Company's products and could harm the Company\u2019s business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe Company's sales of products that are specialized and highly technical in nature are subject to uncertainties, start-up costs and inefficiencies, as well as market, competitive, and compliance risks.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy relies on the design and manufacture of proprietary products. Highly technical, specialized product inventories may be more susceptible to fluctuations in market demand. If demand is unexpectedly low, write-downs or impairments of such inventory may become necessary. Either of these outcomes could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Start-up costs and inefficiencies can adversely affect operating results and such costs may not be recoverable in a proprietary product environment because the Company may not receive reimbursement from its customers for such costs.\nCompetition in agriculture markets could come from the Company's current customers if original equipment manufacturers develop and integrate precision agriculture technology products themselves rather than purchasing from third parties, thereby reducing demand for Applied Technology\u2019s products.\nRegulatory restrictions could be placed on hydraulic fracturing activities as a result of environmental and health concerns, reducing demand for Engineered Film\u2019s products. For Engineered Films, the development of alternative technologies, such as closed loop drilling processes that reduce the need for pit liners in energy exploration, could also reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nAerostar\u2019s future growth relies on sales of high-altitude stratospheric balloons, as well as advanced radar systems to international markets. In limited cases, such sales may be direct commercial sales to foreign governments rather than foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Direct commercial sales to foreign governments often involve large contracts subject to frequent delays because of budget uncertainties, regional military conflicts, political instability, and protracted negotiation processes. Such delays could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. The nature of these markets impact Aerostar's advanced radar systems and aerostats as these products are particularly susceptible to fluctuations in market demand. Demand fluctuations and the likelihood of delays in sales involving large contracts for such products also increase the risk of these products becoming obsolete, increasing the risk associated with expected sales of such products. The total value of certain advanced radar systems and aerostat inventory was approximately $2 million at the end of fiscal year 2019. This valuation is based on an estimate that market demand for these products will be sufficient in future periods such that these inventories will be sold at a price greater than their carrying value and related selling costs. Write-downs or impairment of the value of such products carried in inventory could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. To the extent products become obsolete or anticipated sales are not realized, expected future cash flows could be adversely impacted. This could also lead to an impairment, which could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nSales of certain of Aerostar\u2019s products into international markets increase the compliance risk associated with regulations such as International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as others, exposing the Company to fines and its employees to fines, imprisonment, or civil penalties. Potential consequences of a material violation of such regulations include damage to the Company's reputation, litigation, and increased costs.\nThe Company's Aerostar segment depends on the U.S. government for a significant portion of its sales, creating uncertainty in the timing of and funding for projected contracts.\nA significant portion of Aerostar's sales are to the U.S. government or U.S. government agencies as a prime or sub-contractor. Government spending has historically been cyclical. A decrease in U.S. government defense or near-space research spending or changes in spending allocations could result in one or more of the Company's programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in the Company's existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could adversely affect its ability to sustain and grow its future sales and earnings. The Company's U.S. government sales are funded by the federal budget, which operates on an October-to-September fiscal year. Changes in congressional schedules, negotiations for program funding levels, reduced program funding due to U.S government debt limitations, automatic budget cuts (\"sequestration\"), extended government shutdowns or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract. Funds for multi-year contracts can be changed in subsequent years in the appropriations process.\nIn addition, many U.S. government contracts are subject to a competitive bidding and funding process even after the award of the basic contract, adding an additional element of uncertainty to future funding levels. Delays in the funding process or changes in funding are common and can impact the timing of available funds or can lead to changes in program content or termination at the government's convenience. The loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on the Company's future sales and earnings.\nThe Company derives a portion of its revenues from foreign markets, which subjects the Company to business risks, including risk of changes in government policies and laws or changes in worldwide economic conditions.\nThe Company's consolidated net sales to locations outside of the U.S. were $48.3 million in fiscal 2019, representing approximately 12% of consolidated net sales. The Company's financial results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of U.S. and non-U.S. governments, agencies and similar organizations, along with changes in worldwide economic conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, changes in a country's or region's economic or political condition; trade regulations affecting production, pricing, and marketing of products; local labor conditions and regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability of the Company's products in U.S. dollars in foreign markets where payments are made in the local currency; taxes and tariffs; and other trade barriers. International risks and uncertainties also include changing social and economic conditions, terrorism, political hostilities and war, difficulty in enforcing agreements or collecting receivables, and increased transportation or other shipping costs. Any of these such risks could lead to reduced sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales.\nAdverse economic conditions in the major industries the Company serves may materially affect segment performance and consolidated results of operations.\nThe Company's results of operations are impacted by the market fundamentals of the primary industries served. Significant declines of economic activity in the agricultural, oil and gas exploration, construction, industrial, aerospace/defense, and other major markets served may adversely affect segment performance and consolidated results of operations.\nThe Company may pursue or complete acquisitions which represent additional risk and could impact future financial results.\nThe Company's business strategy includes pursuing future acquisitions. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including integration of the acquired company with the Company's operations and unanticipated liabilities or contingencies related to the acquired company. Further, business strategies supported by the acquisition may be in perceived, or actual, opposition to strategies of certain of the Company's customers and the Company's business could be materially adversely affected if those relationships are terminated and the expected strategic benefits are delayed or are not achieved. The Company cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any acquisition will be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close, which could significantly impact the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Additionally, after the acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise, which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Other acquisition risks include delays in realizing benefits from the acquired companies or products; difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new product or geographic markets entered; unforeseen adjustments, charges or write-offs; unforeseen losses of customers of, or suppliers to, acquired businesses; difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses; or challenges arising from increased geographic diversity and complexity of operations and information technology systems.\nTotal goodwill and intangible assets accounted for $67.2 million, or approximately 19%, of the Company's total assets as of January 31, 2019. The Company evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or intangible assets. These expected future cash flows are dependent on several factors, including revenue growth in certain product lines, and could be adversely impacted if anticipated revenue growth is not realized. Reductions in cash flows could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets, which could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may fail to continue to attract, develop, and retain key management and other key employees, which could negatively impact operating results.\nThe Company depends on the performance of its board of directors, senior management team and other key employees, including experienced and skilled technical personnel. The loss of certain members of its board of directors, senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer, or other key employees, could negatively impact operating results and the ability to execute the Company's business strategy. Future success of the Company will also depend, in part, upon the ability to attract, train, motivate, and retain qualified board members, senior management and other key personnel.\nThe Company may fail to protect its intellectual property effectively, or may infringe upon the intellectual property of others.\nThe Company has developed significant proprietary technology and other rights that are used in its businesses. The Company relies on trade secret, copyright, trademark, and patent laws and contractual provisions to protect the Company's intellectual property. While the Company takes enforcement of these rights seriously, other companies, such as competitors or persons in related markets, may attempt to copy or use the Company's intellectual property for their own benefit.\nIn addition, intellectual property of others has an impact on the Company's ability to offer some of its products and services for specific uses or at competitive prices. Competitors' patents or other intellectual property may limit the Company's ability to offer products and services to its customers. Any infringement or claimed infringement by the Company on the intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect the Company's ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, products and services and negatively impact sales and profitability. Any infringement by the Company could also result in judgments against the Company, which could adversely affect results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results or material settlement of legal proceedings.\nThe Company is sometimes a party to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the merit of any such claims, litigation is often very costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to the operations and business of the Company, and a distraction to management and other personnel. While these matters generally are not material in nature, it is possible a matter may arise that is material to the Company\u2019s business.\nAlthough the Company believes the probability of a materially adverse outcome is remote, if one or more claims were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements may be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could have a material adverse effect on its businesses, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nTechnology failures or cyber-attacks on the Company's systems could disrupt the Company's operations or the functionality of its products and negatively impact the Company's business.\nThe Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In addition, a significant portion of internal communications, as well as communication with customers and suppliers, depends on information technology. Further, the products in Applied Technology and Aerostar segments depend upon GPS and other systems through which products interact with government computer systems and other centralized information sources. The Company is exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. Cyber incidents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property or other sensitive information or may be the result of unintentional events. Like other companies, the Company's information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company's control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, foreign governments, and other security issues. Further, attacks on centralized information sources could affect the operation of the Company's products or cause them to malfunction. The Company has technology security initiatives, education and training programs, and disaster recovery plans in place to manage the Company's risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate, or implemented properly, or executed timely to ensure that the Company's operations are not significantly disrupted. Potential consequences of a material cyber incident include damage to the Company's reputation, litigation, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs. Such consequences could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system may result in short term disruption to the Company\u2019s operations and business, which could adversely impact the Company and damage customer relationships and brand reputation.\nThe Company depends heavily on its management information systems for several aspects of its business. The Company launched a company-wide initiative during the fiscal 2018 third quarter called \"Project Atlas.\" This is a strategic long-term investment to replace the Company\u2019s existing ERP platform. Project Atlas is being implemented in a phased approach and is expected to take approximately three years to complete. If the new ERP system or legacy system are disrupted, in any material way, during implementation, the Company may incur additional expenses and loss of data. Additionally, if improvements or upgrades are required to meet the evolving needs of the Company's business operations, the Company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures or expenses in the pursuit of improvements or upgrades to the new system. These efforts could potentially increase the amount of time for implementation of the new ERP platform, require expenditures above the anticipated amounts, demand the use of additional resources, distract key personnel and potentially cause short-term disruptions to existing systems and business. Any of these outcomes could impair the Company\u2019s ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could adversely impact sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Project Atlas went live in February 2019 for Engineered Films and the remaining divisions are expected to go live in fiscal years 2020 and 2021.", "PERMNO": 62033, "SIC": 3080, "TIC": "RAVN"}
