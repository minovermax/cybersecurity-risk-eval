{"cik": "891293", "company": "CTI BIOPHARMA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The occurrence of any of the risks described below and elsewhere in this document, including the risk that our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects and the trading price of our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects and the trading price of our securities.\nWe will need to raise additional funds to operate our business, but additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any inability to raise required capital when needed could harm our liquidity, financial condition, business, operating results and prospects.\nWe have substantial operating expenses associated with the development of our compounds and the commercialization of PIXUVRI, and we have significant contractual payment obligations. Our available cash and cash equivalents were $70.9 million as of December 31, 2014. We believe that our present financial resources, together with additional milestone payments projected to be received under certain of our contractual agreements, our ability to control costs and expected net sales of PIXUVRI, will only be sufficient to fund our operations through mid-third quarter of 2015. Cash forecasts and capital requirements are subject to change as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties. Changes in manufacturing, developments in and expenses associated with our research and development activities, acquisitions of compounds or other assets, any expansion of our sales and marketing organization for PIXUVRI, regulatory approval developments, ability to consummate appropriate collaborations for development and commercialization activities, litigation and other disputes, competitive market developments and other unplanned business developments may consume capital resources earlier than planned. Additionally, we may not receive anticipated milestone payments or achieve projected net sales from PIXUVRI. Due to these and other factors, our forecast for the period for which we will have sufficient resources to fund our operations, as well as any other operational or business projection we have disclosed, or may, from time to time, disclose, may fail.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have $18.5 million outstanding under our senior secured term loan agreement, and we are required to make monthly interest plus principal payments in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.9 million through October 1, 2016. Such borrowings are secured by a first priority security interest on substantially all of our personal property except our intellectual property and subject to certain other exceptions. In addition, the senior secured term loan agreement, under which we have no additional borrowing capacity, requires us to comply with restrictive covenants, including those that limit our operating flexibility and ability to borrow additional funds. A failure to make a required loan payment or an uncured covenant breach could lead to an event of default, and in such case, all amounts then outstanding may become due and payable immediately.\nWe will need to acquire additional funds in order to operate our business. We may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity financings, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, disposition of assets, debt financings or restructurings, bank borrowings or other sources of financing. However, our ability to do so is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, constraints and consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or convertible securities is restricted by the limited number of our residual authorized shares, the potential difficulty of obtaining shareholder approval to increase authorized shares and the restrictive covenants under our senior secured term loan agreement;\n\u00b7\nissuance of equity-based securities will dilute the proportionate ownership of existing shareholders;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain further funds from any potential loan arrangements is limited by our existing senior secured term loan agreement;\n\u00b7\ncertain financing arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to various assets and/or impose more restrictive terms than any of our existing or past arrangements; and\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to meet additional regulatory requirements, and we may be subject to certain contractual limitations, which may increase our costs and harm our ability to obtain funding.\nFor these and other reasons, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, reduce our selling, general and administrative expenses, be unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, refrain from making our contractually required payments when due (including debt payments) and/or be forced to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Any of these consequences could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe received an audit report for the years ended December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2014 containing an explanatory paragraph on our consolidated financial statements raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe received an audit report for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2014 containing an explanatory paragraph on our consolidated financial statements raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The inclusion of a going concern explanatory paragraph may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and make it more difficult, time consuming or expensive to obtain necessary financing. In the event our operations were to cease, you would suffer a complete loss of your investment in our securities.\nWe expect to continue to incur net losses, and we may never achieve profitability.\nWe were incorporated in 1991 and have incurred a net operating loss every year since our formation. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.0 billion, and we expect to continue to incur net losses. As part of our business plan, we will need to continue to conduct research, development, testing and regulatory compliance activities with respect to our compounds and ensure the procurement of manufacturing and drug supply services, the costs of which, together with projected general and administrative expenses, is expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurances that we will ever achieve profitability.\nIf our development and commercialization collaborations are not successful, or if we are unable to enter into additional collaborations, we may not be able to effectively develop and/or commercialize the applicable compound(s), which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is heavily dependent on the success of our development and commercialization collaborations. In particular, under the Servier Agreement and the Baxter Agreement, we rely heavily on Servier and Baxter, respectively, to collaborate with us to develop and commercialize PIXUVRI and pacritinib. As a result of our dependence on our relationships with Servier and Baxter, the success or commercial viability of PIXUVRI and pacritinib is, to a certain extent, beyond our control. We are subject to a number of specific risks associated with our dependence on our collaborative relationship with Servier and Baxter, including the following: possible disagreements as to the timing, nature and extent of development plans for the respective compound, including clinical trials or regulatory approval strategy; changes in their respective personnel who are key to the collaboration efforts; any changes in their respective business strategies adverse to our interests; possible disagreements regarding ownership of proprietary rights; and the possibility that Servier or Baxter could elect to terminate their respective agreements with us pursuant to certain \u201cat-will\u201d termination clauses or otherwise breach their respective agreements with us. Furthermore, the contingent financial returns under our collaborations with Servier and Baxter depend in large part on the achievement of development and commercialization milestones and the ability to generate applicable product sales to trigger royalty payments. Therefore, our success, and any associated future financial returns to us and our investors, will depend in large part on the performance of each of Servier and Baxter. If our existing collaborations fail, or if we do not successfully enter into additional collaborations when needed, we may be unable to further develop and commercialize our compounds, generate revenues to sustain or grow our business or achieve profitability, which would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nCompounds that appear promising in research and development may fail to reach later stages of development for a number of reasons, including, among others, that clinical trials may take longer to complete than expected or may not be completed at all, and top-line or preliminary clinical trial data reports may ultimately differ from actual results once existing data are more fully evaluated.\nSuccessful development of anti-cancer and other pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain, and obtaining regulatory approval to market drugs to treat cancer is expensive, difficult and speculative. Compounds that appear promising in research and development may fail to reach later stages of development for several reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in obtaining necessary U.S. and international regulatory approvals, or the imposition of a partial or full regulatory hold on a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in formulating a compound, scaling the manufacturing process and obtaining manufacturing approval, pricing, reimbursement issues or other factors that may make the product uneconomical to commercialize;\n\u00b7\nproduction problems, such as the inability to obtain raw materials or supplies satisfying acceptable standards for the manufacture of our products, equipment obsolescence, malfunctions or failures, product quality/contamination problems or changes in regulations requiring manufacturing modifications;\n\u00b7\ninefficient cost structure of a compound compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nobstacles resulting from proprietary rights held by others with respect to a compound, such as patent rights;\n\u00b7\nlower than anticipated rates of patient enrollment as a result of factors, such as the number of patients with the relevant conditions, the proximity of patients to clinical testing centers, eligibility criteria for tests and competition with other clinical testing programs;\n\u00b7\npreclinical or clinical testing requiring significantly more time than expected, resources or expertise than originally expected and inadequate financing, which could cause clinical trials to be delayed or terminated;\n\u00b7\nfailure of clinical testing to show potential products to be safe and efficacious, and failure to demonstrate desired safety and efficacy characteristics in human clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of a clinical trial at any time by us, an applicable collaboration partner or a regulatory authority on the basis that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons;\n\u00b7\ndelays in reaching or failing to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites; and\n\u00b7\nfailure of third parties, such as CROs, academic institutions, collaborators, cooperative groups and/or investigator sponsors, to conduct, oversee and monitor clinical trials and results.\nIn addition, while we have reported top-line data for PERSIST-1 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may report additional top-line data for other trials from time to time, such data are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available efficacy and safety data, and such findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. Top-line or preliminary data is based on important assumptions, estimations, calculations and information then available to us to the extent we have, at the time of such reporting, had an opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate such information in light of all surrounding facts, circumstances, recommendations and analyses. As a result, top-line results observed to date may differ from future results, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results once existing data has been more fully evaluated. In addition, third parties, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular compound and our business in general.\nIf the development of our compounds is delayed or fails, or if top-line or preliminary clinical trial data reported differ from actual results, our development costs may increase and the ability to commercialize our compounds may be harmed, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nWe or our collaboration partners may not obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to develop or commercialize some or all of our compounds.\nWe are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and by comparable agencies in other jurisdictions, including the EMA in the E.U. Pacritinib and our other product candidates are currently in research or development and, other than conditional marketing authorization for PIXUVRI in the E.U., we have not received marketing approval for our compounds. Our products may not be marketed in the U.S. until they have been approved by the FDA and may not be marketed in other jurisdictions until they have received approval from the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies. Each product candidate requires significant research, development and preclinical testing and extensive clinical investigation before submission of any regulatory application for marketing approval. Obtaining regulatory approval requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we may not be able to obtain approval of any of our products on a timely basis, or at all. The number and focus of preclinical and clinical trials that will be required for approval by the FDA, the EMA or any other foreign regulatory agency varies depending on the compound, the disease or condition that the compound is designed to address and the regulations applicable to any particular compound. Preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or preclude regulatory approval. The FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a compound for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\na compound may not be shown to be safe or effective;\n\u00b7\nclinical trial results may be negative or inconclusive, or adverse medical events may occur during a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nsuch regulatory agencies may not approve the manufacturing process of a compound and may interpret data from pre-clinical and clinical trials in different ways than we do;\n\u00b7\na compound may fail to comply with regulatory requirements; or\n\u00b7\nsuch regulatory agencies might change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf our compounds are not approved quickly enough to provide net revenues to defray our operating expenses, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nEven if our compounds are successful in clinical trials and receive regulatory approvals, we or our collaboration partners may not be able to successfully commercialize them.\nThe development and ongoing clinical trials for our compounds may not be successful and, even if they are, the resulting products may never be successfully developed into commercial products. Even if we are successful in our clinical trials and in obtaining other regulatory approvals, the respective products may not reach or remain in the market for a number of reasons including:\n\u00b7\nthey may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects;\n\u00b7\nthey may be difficult to manufacture on a scale necessary for commercialization;\n\u00b7\nthey may be uneconomical to produce;\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to obtain reimbursement approvals or pricing that is cost effective for patients as compared to other available forms of treatment or that covers the cost of production and other expenses;\n\u00b7\nthey may not compete effectively with existing or future alternatives;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to develop commercial operations and to sell marketing rights;\n\u00b7\nthey may fail to achieve market acceptance; or\n\u00b7\nwe may be precluded from commercialization of a product due to proprietary rights of third parties.\nIn particular, with respect to the commercialization of PIXUVRI and the future potential commercialization of pacritinib, we will be heavily dependent on our collaboration partners, Servier and Baxter, respectively. The failure of Servier or Baxter (or any other applicable collaboration partner) to fulfill its respective commercialization obligations with respect to a compound, or the occurrence of any of the events in the list above, could adversely affect the commercialization of our products. If we fail to commercialize products or if our future products do not achieve significant market acceptance, we will not likely generate significant revenues or become profitable.\nThe pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and access to drugs, which could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.\nTo the extent our products are developed, commercialized and successfully introduced to market, they may not be considered cost-effective and third party or government reimbursement might not be available or sufficient. Globally, governmental and other third party payors are becoming increasingly aggressive in attempting to contain healthcare costs by strictly controlling, directly or indirectly, pricing and reimbursement and, in some cases, limiting or denying coverage altogether on the basis of a variety of justifications, and we expect pressures on pricing and reimbursement from both governments and private payors inside and outside the U.S. to continue. In the U.S., we are subject to substantial pricing, reimbursement and access pressures from state Medicaid programs, private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers, and implementation of U.S. health care reform legislation is increasing these pricing pressures. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act instituted comprehensive health care reform, which includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose new and/or increased taxes. In almost all European markets, pricing and choice of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control. Therefore, the price of our products and their reimbursement in Europe is and will be determined by national regulatory authorities. Reimbursement decisions from one or more of the European markets may impact reimbursement decisions in other European markets. A variety of factors are considered in making reimbursement decisions, including whether there is sufficient evidence to show that treatment with the product is more effective than current treatments, that the product represents good value for money for the health service it provides and that treatment with the product works at least as well as currently available treatments. The continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability or those of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners, as well as the availability of capital.\nWe may never be able to generate significant product revenues from the sale of PIXUVRI.\nWe anticipate that, for at least the next several years, our ability to generate revenues and become profitable will depend, in part, on our ability and that of our collaborator, Servier, to successfully commercialize our only marketed product, PIXUVRI. As disclosed elsewhere herein, PIXUVRI is not approved for marketing in the U.S., is presently available only in a limited number of countries and is reimbursed in even fewer countries.\nIn addition, the successful commercialization of PIXUVRI depends heavily on the ability to obtain and maintain favorable reimbursement rates for users of PIXUVRI, as well as on various additional factors, including, without limitation, the ability to:\n\u00b7\nobtain an annual renewal of our conditional marketing authorization for PIXUVRI;\n\u00b7\nincrease demand for and sales of PIXUVRI and obtain greater acceptance of PIXUVRI by physicians and patients;\n\u00b7\nestablish and maintain agreements with wholesalers and distributors on reasonable terms;\n\u00b7\nmaintain, and where necessary, enter into additional, commercial manufacturing arrangements with third parties, cost-effectively manufacture necessary quantities and secure distribution, managerial and other capabilities; and\n\u00b7\nfurther develop and maintain a commercial organization to market PIXUVRI.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize PIXUVRI as planned, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nPost-approval or authorization regulatory reviews and obligations often result in significant expense and marketing limitations, and any failure to satisfy such ongoing obligations, including, in particular, our post-authorization commitment trial for PIXUVRI, could negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nEven if a product receives regulatory approval or authorization, as applicable, we are and will continue to be subject to numerous regulations and statutes regulating the manner of obtaining reimbursement for and selling the product, including limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Approved or authorized products, including PIXUVRI, are subject to extensive labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping regulations. Regulatory authorities may also impose new restrictions on continued product marketing or may require the withdrawal of a product from the market if adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency are discovered following approval. In addition, regulatory agencies may impose post-approval/post-authorization clinical trials, such as our ongoing PIX306 study of PIXUVRI required by the EMA. We cannot predict the outcome of PIX306 or whether we will be able to complete the associated requirements in a timely manner. If we are unable to submit the requisite PIX306 clinical study report by the due date in November 2016 or are otherwise unable to satisfy all applicable requirements, our conditional marketing authorization for PIXUVRI may be revoked. A revocation of PIXUVRI\u2019s or any other product\u2019s approval or authorization or any other failure to maintain applicable regulatory approvals would result in the respective product being withdrawn from the market, product seizures, monetary penalties or possible criminal prosecution, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nWe may be unable to obtain a quorum for meetings of our shareholders or obtain requisite shareholder approval and, consequently, be unable to take certain corporate actions.\nFailure to meet the requisite quorum or obtain requisite shareholder approval can prevent us from raising capital through equity financing or otherwise taking certain actions that may be in our best interest and that of our shareholders. We have experienced such difficulties in the past.\nA portion of our common shares are held by Italian institutions and, under Italian laws and regulations, it is difficult to communicate with the beneficial holders of those shares to obtain votes. In recent years, certain depository banks in Italy holding shares of our common stock have facilitated book-entry transfers of their share positions at Monte Titoli to their U.S. correspondent bank, who would then transfer the shares to an account of the Italian bank at a U.S. broker-dealer that is an affiliate of that bank. Certain of the banks we contacted to facilitate these arrangements agreed to make the share transfers pursuant to these arrangements as of the record date of the shareholder meeting, subject to the relevant beneficial owner being given notice before such record date and taking no action to direct the voting of such shares. Obtaining a quorum and necessary shareholder approvals at shareholder meetings may depend in part upon the willingness of the Italian depository banks to continue participating in the custody transfer arrangements, and we cannot be assured that those banks that have participated in the past will continue to do so in the future.\nAs a result of the foregoing or for other reasons, we may be unable to obtain a quorum at annual or special meetings of shareholders. Even if we are able to obtain a quorum at our shareholder meetings, we may not obtain enough votes to approve matters to be resolved upon at those meetings. Any failure to obtain a quorum or the requisite vote on a proposal in question could harm us.\nWe could fail in financing efforts if we fail to receive shareholder approval when needed.\nWe are required under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules to obtain shareholder approval for any issuance of additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20 percent of the total shares of our common stock outstanding before the issuance of such securities sold at a discount to the greater of book or market value in an offering that is not deemed to be a \u201cpublic offering\u201d by the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, as well as under certain other circumstances. We have in the past and may in the future issue additional equity securities that would comprise more than 20 percent of the total shares of our common stock outstanding in order to fund our operations. However, we might not be successful in obtaining the required shareholder approval for any future issuance that requires shareholder approval pursuant to applicable rules and regulations, particularly in light of difficulties we have had in the past in obtaining a quorum and obtaining the requisite vote. If we are unable to obtain financing or our financing options are limited due to shareholder approval difficulties, such failure may harm our ability to continue operations.\nWe are subject to Italian regulatory requirements, which limit our ability to issue additional shares of our common stock, could result in administrative and other challenges and additional expenses and/or could limit our ability to undertake other business initiatives.\nBecause our common stock is traded on the MTA in Italy, we are required to also comply with the rules and regulations of CONSOB and the Borsa Italiana, which regulate companies listed on Italy\u2019s public markets. Compliance with Italian regulatory requirements may delay additional issuances of our common stock or other business initiatives. Under Italian law, we must publish a registration document, securities note and summary (which jointly compose a prospectus) that have to be approved by CONSOB prior to issuing common stock that is equal to or exceeds, in any twelve-month period, 10 percent of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding at the beginning of that period, subject to certain exceptions. If we are unable to obtain and maintain a registration document, securities note or summary to cover general financing efforts under Italian law, we may be required to raise money using alternative forms of securities. For example, we have issued convertible preferred stock in numerous prior offerings and may in the future issue convertible securities; the common stock resulting from the conversion of such securities, subject to current provisions of European Directive No. 71/2003 and according to the current interpretations of the Committee of European Securities Regulators, is not subject to the 10 percent limitation imposed by E.U. and Italian law. However, this exception to the prospectus requirement could change or cease to be available as a result of changes in regulations, interpretive positions, policies or otherwise. Any such change may increase compliance costs or limit our ability to issue securities. Compliance with these regulations and responding to periodic information requests from Borsa Italiana and CONSOB requires us to devote additional time and resources to regulatory compliance matters and to incur additional expenses of engaging additional outside counsel, accountants and other professional advisors. Actual or alleged failure to comply with Italian regulators can also subject us to regulatory investigations and fines or other sanctions from time to time. For more information on a current investigation, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\nAny of such regulatory requirements of CONSOB and the Borsa Italiana could result in administrative and other challenges and additional expenses, limit our ability to undertake other business initiatives and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe will incur a variety of costs for, and may never realize the anticipated benefits of, acquisitions, collaborations or other strategic transactions.\nWe evaluate and undertake acquisitions, collaborations and other strategic transactions from time to time. The process of negotiating these transactions, as well as integrating any acquisitions and implementing any strategic alliances, may result in operating difficulties and expenditures. In addition, these transactions may require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business, whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated. These undertakings could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, including common stock and preferred stock, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and we may never realize the anticipated benefits. In addition, following the consummation of a transaction, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock may be affected by factors different from those that affected our results of operations and the market price of our common stock prior to such acquisition. Any of the foregoing consequences resulting from transactions of the type described above could harm our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for non-FDA-approved, or off-label, uses.\nOur business and future growth depend on the development, ultimate sale and use of products that are subject to FDA, EMA and or other regulatory agencies regulation, clearance and approval. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means that in the U.S., we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the use of our products, except as allowed by the FDA.\nGovernment investigations concerning the promotion of off-label uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive and burdensome, generate negative publicity and may result in fines or payments of settlement awards. For example, in April 2007, we paid a civil penalty of $10.6 million and entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Washington arising out of their investigation into certain of our prior marketing practices relating to TRISENOX, which was divested to Cephalon in July 2005. As part of that settlement agreement and in connection with the acquisition of Zevalin, we also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of the Inspector General, Health and Human Services, which required us to establish a compliance committee and compliance program and adopt a formal code of conduct. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if we agree to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, we would likely face significant fines and penalties and would likely be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant and educational activities.\nA failure to comply with the numerous laws and regulations that govern our business, including those related to cross-border conduct, healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-corruption and false claims and the protection of health information, could result in substantial penalties and prosecution.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations. For example, we are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. Internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law.\nIn addition, we are subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act. There are similar laws in other countries. These laws may impact, among other things, the sales, marketing and education programs for our products. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willingly soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program. The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act.\nWe may also be subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their respective implementing regulations, or HIPAA, which established uniform standards for certain \u201ccovered entities\u201d (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to \u201cbusiness associates\u201d - independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. In addition to possible civil and criminal penalties for violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of the foregoing or similar laws and regulations, or the impact of such actions. If we were to be found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on third party service providers for a number of critical operational activities including, in particular, for clinical trial activities and for the manufacture, testing and distribution of our compounds and associated supply chain operations. Any failure or delay in these undertakings by third parties could harm our business.\nOur business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under contractual relationships. In particular, we depend on medical institutions and CROs (together with their respective employees, subcontractors and other agents, as applicable) to conduct clinical trials and associated activities in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and in accordance with our timelines, expectations and requirements. To the extent any such third parties are delayed in achieving or fail to meet our clinical trial enrollment expectations, fail to conduct our trials in accordance with GCP or study protocol or otherwise take actions outside of our control or without our consent, our business may be harmed. In addition, we conduct clinical trials in foreign countries, which subjects us to additional risks and challenges, including, in particular, as a result of the engagement of foreign medical institutions and foreign CROs, who may be less experienced with regard to regulatory matters applicable to us and may have different standards of medical care.\nWe also rely heavily on third parties for the manufacture, testing and distribution of our compounds and associated supply chain operations. We do not have internal analytical laboratory or manufacturing facilities to allow the testing or production of drug products in compliance with cGMPs. As a result, we are reliant on third parties to supply us in a timely manner with manufactured products/product candidates. We depend on these third parties to conduct their operations in compliance with cGMPs or similar standards imposed by the U.S. and/or applicable foreign regulatory authorities, including the FDA and EMA. Any of such regulatory authorities may take action against a contract manufacturer who violates cGMPs. Failure of our manufacturers to comply with FDA, EMA or other applicable regulations may cause us to curtail or stop the manufacture of such products until we obtain regulatory compliance. We also rely on third party service providers for certain warehousing, transportation, sales, order processing, distribution and cash collection services. For example, Quintiles Commercial Europe Limited provides a variety of key services to us related to the commercialization of PIXUVRI in certain countries in Europe.\nWith respect to certain clinical trial operations and steps in the manufacturing and distribution chain of our compounds, we rely on single vendors. The use of single vendors for these core operational activities and the resulting lack of diversification expose us to the risk of an interruption in service related to these single, outside vendors. As a result, our exposure to this concentration risk could harm our business.\nIf the third parties on which we depend were to default on the performance of their contractual obligations to us or otherwise fail in properly executing their duties on our behalf, including, but not limited to, those relating to the clinical trials, manufacturing, distribution and other core operational activities, our business could be harmed.\nWe face direct and intense competition from our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may not compete successfully against them.\nCompetition in the oncology market is intense and is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological and product development. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market. Our competitors in the U.S. and elsewhere are numerous and include, among others, major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Specifically:\n\u00b7\nIn Europe, PIXUVRI faces competition from existing treatments for adults with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL. For example, patients are currently being treated with bendamustine, oxaliplatin and gemcitabine, although these particular agents do not have regulatory approval in Europe for the foregoing indication. If we were to pursue bringing PIXUVRI to market in the U.S. (which is not currently part of our near-term plan), PIXUVRI would face similar competition.\n\u00b7\nIf we are successful in bringing pacritinib to market, pacritinib will face competition from ruxolitinib (Jakafi\u00ae).\n\u00b7\nIf we are successful in bringing tosedostat to market, tosedostat will face competition from currently marketed products, such as cytarabine, Dacogen\u00ae, Vidaza\u00ae, Clolar\u00ae, Revlimid\u00ae and Thalomid\u00ae.\n\u00b7\nIf we are successful in bringing Opaxio to market, we will face competition from other taxanes, epothilones, and other cytotoxic agents, which inhibit cancer cells by a mechanism similar to taxanes, or similar products such as paclitaxel and generic forms of paclitaxel, docetaxel, Tarceva\u00ae, Avastin\u00ae, Alimta\u00ae, and Abraxane\u00ae.\nIn addition to the specific competitive factors discussed above, new anti-cancer drugs that may be developed and marketed in the future could compete with our various compounds.\nMany of our competitors, particularly multinational pharmaceutical companies, either alone or together with their collaborators, have substantially greater financial and technical resources and substantially larger development and marketing teams than us, as well as significantly greater experience than we do in developing, commercializing, manufacturing, marketing and selling products. As a result, products of our competitors might come to market sooner or might prove to be more effective, less expensive, have fewer side effects or be easier to administer than ours. In any such case, sales of PIXUVRI or any potential future product would likely suffer and we might never recoup the significant investments we have made and will continue to make to develop and market these compounds.\nIf we are unable to in-license or acquire additional product candidates, our future product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed.\nOne component of our business strategy is the in-licensing and acquisition of drug compounds developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic research laboratories. PIXUVRI, pacritinib, tosedostat and Opaxio have all been in-licensed or acquired from third parties. Competition for new, promising compounds and commercial products can be intense. If we are not able to identify future in-licensing or acquisition opportunities and enter into arrangements on acceptable terms, our future product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed.\nIf any of our license agreements for intellectual property underlying our compounds are terminated, we may lose the right to develop or market that product.\nWe have acquired or licensed intellectual property from third parties, including patent applications and patents relating to intellectual property for PIXUVRI, pacritinib and tosedostat. We have also licensed the intellectual property for our drug delivery technology relating to Opaxio, which uses polymers that are linked to drugs known as polymer-drug conjugates. Some of our product development programs depend on our ability to maintain rights under these arrangements. Each licensor has the power to terminate its agreement with us if we fail to meet our obligations under these licenses. We may not be able to meet our obligations under these licenses. If we default under any license agreement, we may lose our right to market and sell any products based on the licensed technology and may be forced to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Bankruptcy may result in the termination of agreements pursuant to which we license certain intellectual property rights.\nWe hold rights under numerous patents that we have acquired or licensed or that protect inventions originating from our research and development, and the expiration of any of these patents may allow our competitors to copy the inventions that are currently protected.\nWe dedicate significant resources to protecting our intellectual property, which is important to our business. We have filed numerous patent applications in the U.S. and various other countries seeking protection of inventions originating from our research and development, and we have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties and through acquisitions. Patents have been issued on many of these applications. We have pending patent applications or issued patents in the U.S. and foreign countries directed to PIXUVRI, pacritinib, tosedostat, Opaxio and other product candidates. However, the lives of these patents are limited. Patents for the individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The patent status of our compounds follows:\n\u00b7\nOur PIXUVRI-directed patents currently in force in Europe will begin to expire in late March 2015 through a portion of 2023. Certain of such European patents are also subject to Supplementary Protection Certificates that extend the life of the applicable patents such that they will instead expire from 2020 to 2027. In addition, we are seeking to obtain Supplementary Protection Certificates for certain other of our PIXUVRI-directed European patents that, if obtained, could provide extensions of the applicable patents through 2027. However, no assurances can be made that such extensions will be granted. Our PIXUVRI-directed U.S. patents expired in 2014, and although we have a pending PIXUVRI-directed U.S. patent application (which, if granted, would expire in 2023), we have to date been unable to obtain issuance of a patent for such application (and no assurances can be made that we will ever receive such patent). Our PIXUVRI-directed patents outside of Europe and the U.S. expire from 2015 to 2023.\n\u00b7\nOur U.S. and various foreign pacritinib-directed patents expire from 2026 through 2029.\n\u00b7\nOur U.S. and various foreign tosedostat-directed patents expire from 2017 to 2018.\n\u00b7\nOur U.S. and various foreign Opaxio-directed patents expire on various dates ranging from 2017 through 2018.\n\u00b7\nOur U.S. and various foreign brostallicin-directed patents expire on various dates ranging between 2017 through 2021.\nIn the absence of a patent, as in the case of PIXUVRI in the U.S., we will, to the extent possible, need to rely on unpatented technology, know-how and confidential information. Ultimately, the lack or expiration at any given time of a patent to protect our compounds may allow our competitors to copy the underlying inventions and better compete with us.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position and the potential for long-term success could be harmed.\nDevelopment and protection of our intellectual property are critical to our business. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to practice our technologies. Our success depends in part on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nobtain and maintain patent protection for our products or processes both in the U.S. and other countries;\n\u00b7\nprotect trade secrets; and\n\u00b7\nprevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including ours, generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has not established a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in biotechnology patents. If it allows broad claims, the number and cost of patent interference proceedings in the U.S. and the risk of infringement litigation may increase. If it allows narrow claims, the risk of infringement may decrease, but the value of our rights under our patents, licenses and patent applications may also decrease. Patent applications in which we have rights may never issue as patents, and the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technologies or products. In addition, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged and subsequently narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Litigation, interference proceedings or other governmental proceedings that we may become involved in with respect to our proprietary technologies or the proprietary technology of others could result in substantial cost to us.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. Third parties may independently develop such know-how or otherwise obtain access to our technology. While we require our employees, consultants and corporate partners with access to proprietary information to enter into confidentiality agreements, these agreements may not be honored.\nPatent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry, and any patent litigation could harm our business.\nCostly litigation might be necessary to protect a patent position or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights, and we may not have the required resources to pursue any such litigation or to protect our patent rights. Any adverse outcome in litigation with respect to the infringement or validity of any patents owned by third parties could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using a product or technology. With respect to our in-licensed patents, if we attempt to initiate a patent infringement suit against an alleged infringer, it is possible that our applicable licensor will not participate in or assist us with the suit and as a result we may not be able to effectively enforce the applicable patents against the alleged infringers.\nWe may be unable to obtain or protect our intellectual property rights, and we may be liable for infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if unsuccessful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products.\nAt times, we may monitor patent filings for patents that might be relevant to some of our products and product candidates in an effort to guide the design and development of our products to avoid infringement, but may not have conducted an exhaustive search. We may not be able to successfully challenge the validity of third party patents and could be required to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, for past infringement and attorneys\u2019 fees if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe such patents. Further, we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties.\nMoreover, third parties may challenge the patents that have been issued or licensed to us. We do not believe that PIXUVRI, pacritinib or any of the other compounds we are currently developing infringe upon the rights of any third parties nor are they materially infringed upon by third parties; however, there can be no assurance that our technology will not be found in the future to infringe upon the rights of others or be infringed upon by others. In such a case, others may assert infringement claims against us, and should we be found to infringe upon their patents, or otherwise impermissibly utilize their intellectual property, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties\u2019 patent rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, we may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of this intellectual property, enter into royalty agreements or redesign our compounds so as not to utilize this intellectual property, each of which may prove to be uneconomical or otherwise impossible. Conversely, we may not always be able to successfully pursue our claims against others that infringe upon our technology and the technology exclusively licensed from any third parties. Thus, the proprietary nature of our technology or technology licensed by us may not provide adequate protection against competitors.\nEven if infringement claims against us are without merit, or if we challenge the validity of issued patents, lawsuits take significant time, may, even if resolved in our favor, be expensive and divert management attention from other business concerns. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of a product or stolen product could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nThird parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of a product, which does not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit product may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit product sold under our brand name. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nWe may owe additional amounts for value added tax, or VAT, related to our operations in Europe.\nOur European operations are subject to the VAT, which is usually applied to all goods and services purchased and sold throughout Europe. The VAT receivable was $4.9 million and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. On April 14, 2009, December 21, 2009 and June 25, 2010, the Italian Tax Authority, or the ITA, issued notices of assessment to our branch, Cell Therapeutics Inc.-Sede Secondaria, or CTI (Europe), based on the ITA\u2019s audit of CTI (Europe)\u2019s VAT returns for the years 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The ITA audits concluded that CTI (Europe) did not collect and remit VAT on certain invoices issued to non-Italian clients for services performed by CTI (Europe). The assessments, including interest and penalties, for the years 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2007 are \u20ac0.5 million, \u20ac5.5 million, \u20ac2.5 million and \u20ac0.8 million. While we are defending ourselves against the assessments both on procedural grounds and on the merits of the case, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in such defense. Further information pertaining to these cases can be found in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and is incorporated by reference herein. If the final decision of the Italian Supreme Court is unfavorable to us, or if, in the interim, the ITA were to make a demand for payment and we were to be unsuccessful in suspending collection efforts, we may be requested to pay to the ITA an amount up to \u20ac9.4 million (or approximately $11.4 million converted using the currency exchange rate as of December 31, 2014) plus collection fees, notification expenses and additional interest for the period lapsed between the date in which the assessments were issued and the date of effective payment.\nWe are currently subject to certain regulatory and legal proceedings, and may in the future be subject to additional proceedings and/or allegations of wrong-doing, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory matters and legal claims, including possible securities, derivative, consumer protection and other types of proceedings pursued by individuals, entities or regulatory bodies. As described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, we are currently engaged in a number of pending legal matters. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and we have had and may in the future have unfavorable rulings and settlements. Adverse outcomes in some or all of such pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. It is possible that our financial condition and operating results could be harmed in any period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable, and if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any of the legal proceedings we are or may be subject to, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits from time to time, some of which arise in the ordinary course of our business. The ultimate outcome of litigation and other claims is subject to inherent uncertainties, and our view of these matters may change in the future.\nSecurities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits are often instituted against issuers. We have been subjected to such actions and we, together with our directors and one former director, presently are subject to a derivative lawsuit.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending litigation. In addition, negative publicity resulting from any allegations of wrong-doing could harm our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are liable. Furthermore, we may have to incur substantial time and expense in connection with such lawsuits and management\u2019s attention and resources could be diverted from operating our business as we respond to the litigation. Our insurance is subject to high deductibles and there is no guarantee that the insurance will cover any specific claim that we currently face or may face in the future, or that it will be adequate to cover all potential liabilities and damages. In the event of negative publicity resulting from allegations of wrong-doing and/or an adverse outcome under any currently pending or future lawsuit, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur net operating losses may not be available to reduce future income tax liability.\nWe have substantial tax loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but our ability to use such carryforwards to offset future income or tax liability is limited under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as a result of prior changes in the stock ownership of the Company. Moreover, future changes in the ownership of our stock, including those resulting from issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants, may further limit our ability to use our net operating losses.\nDue to the fact that we have European branches and subsidiaries conducting operations, together with the fact that we are party to certain contractual arrangements denoting monetary amounts in foreign currencies, we are subject to risk regarding currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the translation of euro-denominated financial results and accounts into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses, in our European branches and subsidiaries will be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the euro. In addition, certain of our contractual arrangements, such as the Servier Agreement, denote monetary amounts in foreign currencies, and consequently, the ultimate financial impact to us from a U.S. dollar perspective is subject to significant uncertainty. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies (in particular, the euro) might have an adverse effect on our reported operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to obtain the raw materials necessary to produce a particular product or product candidate.\nWe may not be able to purchase the materials necessary to produce a particular product or product candidate in adequate volume and quality. For example, paclitaxel, a material used to produce Opaxio, is derived from certain varieties of yew trees and the supply of paclitaxel is controlled by a limited number of companies. If any raw material required to produce a product or product candidate is insufficient in quantity or quality, if a supplier fails to deliver in a timely fashion or at all or if these relationships terminate, we may not be able to qualify and obtain a sufficient supply from alternate sources on acceptable terms, or at all.\nBecause there is a risk of product liability associated with our compounds, we face potential difficulties in obtaining insurance, and if product liability lawsuits were to be successfully brought against us, our business may be harmed.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human pharmaceutical products. In particular, as a result of the commercialization of PIXUVRI, our risk with respect to potential product liability has increased. If our insurance covering a compound is not maintained on acceptable terms or at all, we might not have adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or limit the commercialization of any products we develop. A successful product liability claim could also exceed our insurance coverage and could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, both internationally and domestically, governing the use, manufacture, storage, handlings, treatment, transportation and disposal of such materials and certain waste products and employee safety and health matters. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with applicable law and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability not covered by insurance could exceed our resources. Compliance with environmental, safety and health laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. The size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption. Any such successful attacks could result in the theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. We have invested in our systems and the protection of our data to reduce the risk of an intrusion or interruption, and we monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns. If we fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and cash flows.\nRisks Related To the Securities Markets\nShares of our common stock are subordinate to any preferred stock we may issue and to existing and any future indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock rank junior to any shares of our preferred stock that we may issue in the future and to our existing indebtedness, including under our senior secured term loan agreement, and any future indebtedness we may incur, as well as to all creditor claims and other non-equity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims on us, including claims in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Our senior secured term loan agreement restricts, and any future indebtedness and preferred stock may restrict, payment of dividends on our common stock.\nAdditionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of our common stock, (i) dividends are payable only when and if declared by our Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of our Board of Directors and (ii) as a corporation, we are restricted to making dividend payments and redemption payments out of legally available assets. We have never paid a dividend on our common stock and have no current intention to pay dividends in the future. Furthermore, our common stock places no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions, subject only to the voting rights available to our shareholders generally.\nWe may not be able to maintain our listings on The NASDAQ Capital Market and the MTA in Italy, or trading on these exchanges may otherwise be halted or suspended, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock and consequently may negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nMaintaining the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market requires that we comply with certain listing requirements. We have in the past and may in the future fail to continue to meet one or more listing requirements. For example, in June 2012, we received a notification from The NASDAQ Stock Market indicating non-compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share and that we would be delisted if we did not timely regain compliance. We regained compliance through a reverse stock split in September 2012, but we could fail to meet the continued listing requirements as a result of a decrease in our stock price or otherwise.\nIf our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market for any reason, it may harm our stock price, increase the volatility of our stock price, decrease the level of trading activity and make it more difficult for investors to buy or sell shares of our common stock. Our failure to maintain a listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market may constitute an event of default under our senior secured term loan and any future indebtedness, which would accelerate the maturity date of such debt or trigger other obligations. In addition, certain institutional investors that are not permitted to own securities of non-listed companies may be required to sell their shares adversely affecting the market price of our common stock. If we are not listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market or if our public float falls below $75 million, we will be limited in our ability to file new shelf registration statements on SEC Form S-3 and/or to fully use one or more registration statements on SEC Form S-3. We have relied significantly on shelf registration statements on SEC Form S-3 for most of our financings in recent years, so any such limitations may harm our ability to raise the capital we need. Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market could also affect our ability to maintain our listing or trading on the MTA in Italy. Trading in our common stock has been halted or suspended on both The NASDAQ Capital Market and MTA in the past and may also be halted or suspended in the future due to market or trading conditions at the discretion of The NASDAQ Stock Market, CONSOB or the Borsa Italiana (which ensures the development of the managed markets in Italy). Any halt or suspension in the trading in our common stock may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock is extremely volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital in the future and may subject the value of your investment in our securities to sudden decreases.\nThe market price for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, historically has been highly volatile, and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. For example, during the 12-month period ended March 5, 2015, our stock price has ranged from a low of $2.00 to a high of $4.22. Fluctuations in the market price or liquidity of our common stock may harm the value of your investment in our common stock.\nFactors that may have an impact, which, depending on the circumstances, could be significant, on the market price and marketability of our securities include:\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or others of results of clinical trials and regulatory actions;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or others of serious adverse events that have occurred during administration of our products to patients;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or others relating to our ongoing development and commercialization activities;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations or new commercial therapeutic products by us, our collaborative partners or our present or potential competitors;\n\u00b7\nour issuance of debt or equity securities, which we expect to pursue to generate additional funds to operate our business, or any perception from time to time that we will issue such securities;\n\u00b7\nour quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nliquidity, cash position or financing needs;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in relationships with collaborative partners;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions or divestitures;\n\u00b7\nour ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our compounds;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and government proceedings;\n\u00b7\nadverse legislation, including changes in governmental regulation;\n\u00b7\nthird party reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations;\n\u00b7\nshort selling of our securities;\n\u00b7\nchanges in health care policies and practices;\n\u00b7\na failure to achieve previously announced goals and objectives as or when projected;\n\u00b7\nhalting or suspension of trading in our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market or on the MTA; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, in our shareholder rights agreement, or rights plan, under Washington law and in other applicable instruments could make removal of incumbent management or an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, more difficult.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our shareholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests, or to effect changes in control. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nelimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nprocedures for advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws without shareholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, privileges and preferences as our Board of Directors may determine.\nPursuant to our rights plan, an acquisition of 20 percent or more of our common stock by a person or group, subject to certain exceptions, could result in the exercisability of the preferred stock purchase right accompanying each share of our common stock (except those held by a 20 percent shareholder, which become null and void), thereby entitling the holder to receive upon exercise, in lieu of a number of units of preferred stock, that number of shares of our common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right. The existence of our rights plan could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interest or that could give our shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for their shares.\nIn addition, as a Washington corporation, we are subject to Washington\u2019s anti-takeover statute, which imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders. Other existing provisions applicable to us that could have an anti-takeover effect include our executive employment agreements and certain provisions of our outstanding equity-based compensatory awards that allow for acceleration of vesting in the event of a change in control.\nThe foregoing provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.", "PERMNO": 84604, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CTIC"}
