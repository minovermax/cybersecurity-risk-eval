{"cik": "105132", "company": "WD 40 CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-10-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nThe following risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report or in other SEC filings by the Company, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s financial results could suffer if the Company is unable to implement and successfully manage its strategic initiatives or if the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives do not achieve the intended results.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to implement and successfully manage its strategic initiatives, including its five major strategic initiatives, or that the strategic initiatives will achieve the intended results, which include sales volume growth. The Company\u2019s five core strategic initiatives include: (i) maximizing WD-40 multi-use product sales through geographic expansion and increased market penetration; (ii) leveraging the WD-40 brand by growing the WD-40 Specialist product line; (iii) leveraging the strengths of the Company through a broadened product and revenue base; (iv) attracting, developing and retaining talented people; and (v) operating with excellence. An important part of the Company\u2019s success depends on its continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel. The Company\u2019s future performance depends in\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsignificant part on the continued service of its executive officers, key personnel and other talented people. The loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and prospects. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company can retain its key employees or attract, assimilate and retain employee engagement in the future. If the Company is unable to implement and successfully manage its strategic initiatives in accordance with its business plans, the Company\u2019s business and financial results could be adversely affected. Moreover, the Company cannot be certain that the implementation of its strategic initiatives will necessarily advance its business or financial results as intended.\n\ufeff\nCost increases or cost volatility in finished goods, components, raw materials, transportation and other necessary supplies or services could harm or impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIncreases in the cost of finished goods, components and raw materials and increases in the cost of transportation and other necessary supplies or services may harm the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, which constitute a significant portion of the costs for many of the Company\u2019s maintenance products, have experienced significant price volatility in the past, and may continue to do so in the future. In particular, volatility in the price of oil directly impacts the cost of petroleum-based specialty chemicals which are indexed to the price of crude oil. Additionally, fluctuations in oil and diesel fuel prices have also historically impacted the Company\u2019s cost of transporting its products among other input costs. If there are significant increases in the costs of components, raw materials and other expenses, and the Company is not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, the Company\u2019s gross margins and operating results will be negatively impacted. In addition, if the Company increases product sales prices in response to increases in the cost of such raw materials, and those raw material costs later decline significantly, the Company may not be able to sustain its sales prices at these higher levels. As component and raw material costs are the principal contributors to the cost of goods sold for all of the Company\u2019s products, any significant fluctuation in the costs of components and raw materials could have a material impact on the gross margins realized on the Company\u2019s products. Sustained increases in the cost of raw materials, components, transportation and other necessary supplies or services, or significant volatility in such costs, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nGlobal operations outside the U.S. expose the Company to uncertain conditions, foreign currency exchange rate risk and other risks in international markets.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s sales outside of the U.S. were approximately 58% of consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2016 and one of its strategic initiatives includes maximizing the WD-40 multi-use product through geographic expansion and market penetration. As a result, the Company currently faces, and will continue to face, substantial risks associated with having increased global operations outside the U.S., including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\neconomic or political instability in the Company\u2019s global markets, including Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, parts of Asia, Russia, Eastern Europe and the Eurozone countries;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the U.S., including possible taxes or withholding obligations on any repatriations;\n\u00b7\nchallenges associated with conducting business in foreign jurisdictions, including those related to the Company\u2019s understanding of business laws and regulations in such foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nincreasing tax complexity associated with operating in multiple tax jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ndispersed employee base and compliance with employment regulations and other labor issues, such as labor laws and minimum wages, in countries outside the U.S.; and\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions and costs, burdens and restrictions associated with other governmental actions.\n\ufeff\nThese risks could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to sell its products on a competitive basis in global markets outside the U.S. and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nApproximately 38% of the Company\u2019s revenues in fiscal year 2016 were generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is the reporting currency of the Company. In addition, all of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar and the Company\u2019s largest subsidiary is located in the U.K. and generates significant sales in Pound Sterling and Euro. As a result, the Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its sales, expenses, profits, cash and cash equivalents, other assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. In particular, the Company\u2019s financial results are negatively impacted when the foreign currencies in which its subsidiary offices operate weaken relative to the U.S. Dollar. Although the Company uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, primarily those associated with its U.K. subsidiary and converting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies, it is not fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and, therefore, the Company\u2019s reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), global markets and foreign currencies have been adversely impacted. In particular, the value of the Pound Sterling has sharply declined as compared to the U.S. Dollar and other currencies in the months following this vote. This volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the U.K. negotiates and executes its exit from the European Union but it is uncertain over what time period this will occur. A significantly weaker Pound Sterling compared to the U.S. Dollar over a sustained period of time may have a significant negative effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s global operations outside the U.S. are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. The uncertainties and likely complications resulting from Brexit may increase these risks for the Company\u2019s European business operations. As the Company further develops and grows its business operations outside the U.S., the Company is exposed to additional complexities and risks, particularly in China, Russia and emerging markets. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, business practices that are prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations may be customary. Any failure to comply with these laws, even if inadvertent, could result in significant penalties or otherwise harm the Company\u2019s reputation and business. Although the Company has adopted policies and contract terms to mandate compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of its employees, contractors and agents will comply with the Company\u2019s requirements. Violations of these laws could be costly and disrupt the Company\u2019s business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations\n\ufeff\nGlobal economic conditions may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nA general weakening or decline in the global economy or a reduction in industrial outputs, business or consumer spending or confidence could delay or significantly decrease purchases of the Company\u2019s products by its customers and end users. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could include the Company\u2019s maintenance products and homecare and cleaning products, may decline during periods where disposable income is reduced or there is economic uncertainty, and this may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. During unfavorable or uncertain economic times, end users may also increase purchases of lower-priced or non-branded products and the Company\u2019s competitors may increase their level of promotional activities to maintain sales volumes, both of which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s sales and operating results may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions, including inflation, deflation, prolonged weak consumer demand, political instability or other changes which may affect the principal markets in which the Company conducts its business. If economic or market conditions in key global markets deteriorate, the Company may experience material adverse effects on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAdverse economic and market conditions could also harm the Company\u2019s business by negatively affecting the parties with whom it does business, including its customers, retailers, distributors and wholesalers, and third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers. These conditions could impair the ability of the Company\u2019s customers to pay for products they have purchased from the Company. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable from the Company\u2019s customers may increase. In addition, the Company\u2019s third-party contract manufacturers and its suppliers may experience financial difficulties that could negatively affect their operations and their ability to supply the Company with finished goods and the raw materials, packaging, and components required for the Company\u2019s products.\n\ufeff\nIf the success and reputation of one or more of the Company\u2019s leading brands erodes, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n\ufeff\nThe financial success of the Company is directly dependent on the success and reputation of its brands, particularly its WD-40 brand. The success and reputation of the Company\u2019s brands can suffer if marketing plans or product development and improvement initiatives do not have the desired impact on the brands\u2019 image or do not attract customers as intended. The Company\u2019s brands can also be adversely impacted due to the activities and pressures placed on them by the Company\u2019s competitors. Further, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if one of its leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality or safety issues. Quality issues, which can lead to large scale recalls of the Company\u2019s products, can be due to items such as product contamination, regulatory non-compliance, packaging errors, incorrect ingredients or components in the Company\u2019s product or low quality ingredients in the Company\u2019s products due to suppliers delivering items that do not meet the Company\u2019s specifications. Product quality issues, which could include lower product efficacy due to formulation changes attributable to regulatory requirements, could also result in decreased customer confidence in the Company\u2019s brands and a decline in product quality could result in product liability\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nclaims. Although the Company makes every effort to prevent brand erosion and preserve its reputation and the reputation of its brands, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\n\ufeff\nSales unit volume growth may be difficult to achieve.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s ability to achieve sales volume growth will depend on its ability to (i) execute its strategic initiatives, (ii) drive growth within its existing markets through innovation, renovation and enhanced merchandising and marketing of its established brands, and (iii) capture market share from its competitors. It is more difficult for the Company to achieve sales volume growth in mature markets where the Company\u2019s products are widely used as compared to in developing or emerging markets where the Company\u2019s products have been newly introduced or are not as well known by consumers. In order to protect the Company\u2019s existing market share or capture additional market share from its competitors, the Company may need to increase its expenditures related to promotions and advertising or introduce and establish new products or product lines. In past periods, the Company has also increased sales prices on certain of its products in response to increased costs for components and raw materials. Sales price increases may slow sales volume growth or create declines in volume in the short term as customers adjust to sales price increases. In addition, a change in the strategies of the Company\u2019s existing customers, including shelf simplification, the discontinuation of certain product offerings or the shift in shelf space to competitors\u2019 products could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and potentially offset sales volume increases achieved as a result of other sales growth initiatives. If the Company is unable to increase market share in its existing product lines by developing product improvements, investing adequately in its existing brands, building usage among new customers, developing, acquiring or successfully launching new products or product line extensions, or successfully penetrating new and developing markets globally, the Company may not achieve its sales volume growth objectives.\n\ufeff\nGovernment laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, could result in material costs or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe manufacturing, chemical composition, packaging, storage, distribution and labeling of the Company\u2019s products and the manner in which the Company\u2019s business operations are conducted must comply with an extensive array of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. If the Company is not successful in complying with the requirements of all such regulations, it could be fined or other actions could be taken against the Company by the applicable governing body, including the possibility of a required product recall. Any such regulatory action could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. It is also possible that governments and regulatory agencies will increase regulation, including the adoption of further regulations relating to the transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals, to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and such increased regulation could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain raw materials, components and/or finished goods or could result in increased costs. In the event that such regulations result in increased product costs, the Company may not be in a position to raise selling prices, and therefore an increase in costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of the Company\u2019s products have chemical compositions that are controlled by various state, federal and international laws and regulations, such as regulations issued by the California Air Resources Board relating to permitted levels of volatile organic compounds. The Company is required to comply with these laws and regulations and it seeks to anticipate regulatory developments that could impact the Company\u2019s ability to continue to produce and market its products. The Company invests in research and development to maintain product formulations that comply with such laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be required to alter the chemical composition of one or more of the Company\u2019s products in a way that will have an adverse effect upon the product\u2019s efficacy or marketability. A delay or other inability of the Company to complete product research and development and successfully reformulate its products in response to any such regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is subject to an SEC rule mandated by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that requires management to conduct annual due diligence to determine whether certain minerals and metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d, are contained in the Company\u2019s products and, if so, whether they originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) or adjoining countries. Although the Company\u2019s current products do not contain such conflict minerals and the Company has concluded this in its annual evaluations to date, the Company\u2019s supply chain structure is complex. As a result, management may have difficulty determining whether these materials exist within the Company\u2019s products in future periods, and if the Company were to conclude that these materials exist within the Company\u2019s products in future periods, the Company may have difficulty verifying the origin of such materials for purposes of disclosures required by the SEC rules.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on its business operations, including, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of solid and hazardous wastes and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations may otherwise relate to various health and safety matters that impose burdens upon the Company\u2019s operations. These laws and regulations also impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncosts of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. The Company believes that its expenditures related to environmental matters have not had, and are not currently expected to have, a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the environmental laws under which the Company operates are complicated, often become increasingly more stringent and may be applied retroactively. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be required to incur additional expenditures to remain in or to achieve compliance with environmental laws in the future or that any such additional expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAdditional laws and regulations require that the Company carefully manage its supply chain for the production, distribution and sale of goods. For instance, regulations under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the U.K. Modern Slavery Act require attention to the employment practices of our suppliers. Various regulations affect the packaging, labelling and shipment of our products, including the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals which is applicable in many countries worldwide, and regulations issued by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and similar foreign jurisdiction regulatory agencies. Our failure to comply with any of these regulations or our inability to adequately predict the manner in which these regulations are interpreted and applied to our business by the applicable enforcement agencies could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFailure to maximize or to successfully assert the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights or infringement by the Company on the intellectual property rights of others could impact its competitiveness or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies on trademark, trade secret protection, patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights. Although the Company maintains a global enforcement program to protect its intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. Trade secret protection, particularly for the Company\u2019s most valuable product formulation for the WD-40 multi-use product, requires specific agreements, policies and procedures to assure the secrecy of information classified as a trade secret. If such agreements, policies and procedures are not effective to maintain the secrecy of the Company\u2019s trade secrets, the loss of trade secret protection could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions or acquired product lines. The Company cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and the Company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to defend its intellectual property rights. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the U.S., it may be that the laws of some of the other countries in which the Company\u2019s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or they may be difficult to enforce. If other companies infringe the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights or take part in counterfeiting activities, they may dilute the value of the Company\u2019s brands in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the Company\u2019s brands and harm its sales. The failure of the Company to protect or successfully assert its intellectual property rights or to protect its other proprietary information could make the Company less competitive and this could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIf the Company is found to have violated the trademark, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, such a finding could result in the need to cease the use of a trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in the Company\u2019s business and an obligation to pay a substantial amount for past infringement. It could also be necessary to pay a substantial amount in the future if the holders of such rights are willing to permit the Company to continue to use the intellectual property rights. Either having to cease use or pay such amounts could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nMalfunctions of the critical information systems that the Company uses for the daily operations of its business, cyberattacks and privacy breaches could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business.\n\ufeff\nTo conduct its business, the Company relies extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party service providers. System failure, malfunction or loss of data which is housed in the Company\u2019s critical information systems could disrupt its ability to timely and accurately process transactions and produce key financial reports, including information on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial position and cash flows. In addition, information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the Company\u2019s information technology systems and networks, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. The Company\u2019s information systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to a number of reasons, including catastrophic events, power outages and security breaches. A security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from the Company\u2019s information systems could also materially increase the costs that the Company\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nalready incurs to protect against such risks. Although the Company has certain business continuity plans in place to address such service interruptions, there is no guarantee that these business continuity plans will provide alternative processes in a timely manner. As a result, the Company may experience interruptions in its ability to manage its daily operations and this could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe information system that the U.S. office uses for its business operations is a market specific application which is not widely used by other companies. The company that owns and supports this application may not be able to provide the same level of support as that of companies which own larger, more widely spread information systems. If the company that supports this application in the U.S. were to cease its operations or were unable to provide continued support for this application, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s daily operations or its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s U.K. subsidiary has been in the process of implementing a major upgrade to its critical information system. The final phase of this implementation is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2017. This information system is being used by the U.K. subsidiary to process all of the daily transactions for the U.K. subsidiary and its branch offices located in Europe and to produce key financial reports for the European operations. If the U.K. subsidiary experiences difficulties in completing the final phase of this implementation at its various locations, the Company may experience interruptions in its ability to manage its daily operations and report financial results and this could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company faces competition in its markets which could lead to reduced sales and profitability.\n\ufeff\nThe Company encounters competition from similar and alternative products, many of which are produced and marketed by major national or multinational companies. In addition, the Company frequently discovers products in certain markets that are counterfeit reproductions of the Company\u2019s WD-40 products as well as products otherwise bearing an infringing trade dress. The availability of counterfeits and other infringing products, particularly in China, Russia and emerging markets, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales and potentially damage the value and reputation of its brands.\nThe Company\u2019s products generally compete on the basis of product performance, brand recognition, price, quality or other benefits to consumers and meeting end users\u2019 needs. Advertising, promotions, merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions. A newly introduced consumer product, whether improved or recently developed, usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales and consumer promotion. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising, promotional support and product improvements in order to maintain its relative market position.\n\ufeff\nSome of the competitors for the Company\u2019s homecare and cleaning products are larger and have financial resources greater than those of the Company. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the Company.\n\ufeff\nCompetitive activity may require the Company to increase its investment in marketing or reduce its sales prices and this may lead to reduced profit margins, a loss of market share or loss of distribution, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the Company or the infringement of its products and brands will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nDependence on key customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company sells its products through a network of domestic and international mass retail and consumer retailers as well as industrial distributors and suppliers. The retail industry has historically been the subject of consolidation, and as a result, the development of large chain stores has taken place. Today, the retail channel in the U.S. is comprised of several of these large chain stores that capture the bulk of the market share. Since many of the Company\u2019s customers have been part of the consolidation in the retail industry, these limited customers account for a large percentage of the Company\u2019s net sales. Although the Company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from this limited number of customers, there was no individual customer that contributed to more than 10% of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2016. As a result, changes in the strategies of the Company\u2019s largest customers, including shelf simplification, a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift in shelf space to \u201cprivate label\u201d or competitors\u2019 products, may harm the Company\u2019s sales. The loss of, or reduction in, orders from any of the Company\u2019s most significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s brand values, business, financial condition and results of operations. Large customers may seek price reductions,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nadded support or promotional concessions. If the Company agrees to such customer demands and/or requests, it could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to maintain existing profit margins.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders, and the Company typically does not enter into long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the Company at any time and for any reason. The Company is also subject to changes in customer purchasing patterns or the level of promotional activities. These types of changes may result from changes in the manner in which customers purchase and manage inventory levels, or display and promote products within their stores. Other potential factors such as customer disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or related matters may also impact operating results. If the Company ceases doing business with a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may not successfully develop, introduce and /or establish new products and line extensions.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s future performance and growth depend, in part, on its ability to successfully develop, introduce and/or establish new products as both brand extensions and/or line extensions. The Company cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve those goals. The Company competes in several product categories where there are frequent introductions of new products and line extensions and such product introductions often require significant investment and support. The ability of the Company to understand consumer preferences is key to maintaining and improving the competitiveness of its product offerings. The development and introduction of new products, as well as the renovation of current products and product lines, require substantial and effective research, development and marketing expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recoup if the new or renovated products do not gain widespread market acceptance. There are inherent risks associated with new product development and marketing efforts, including product development or launch delays, product performance issues during development, changing regulatory frameworks that affect the new products in development and the availability of key raw materials included in such products. These inherent risks could result in the failure of new products and product line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance, additional costs resulting from failed product introductions and the Company not being first to market. As the Company continues to focus on innovation and renovation of its products, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in the event that the Company is not able to effectively develop and introduce new or renovated products and line or brand extensions.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and intangible assets are subject to impairment risk.\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance on goodwill and intangibles, the Company assesses the potential impairment of its existing goodwill during the second quarter of each fiscal year and otherwise when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist. The Company also assesses its definite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable or its estimated remaining useful life may no longer be appropriate. Indicators such as underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, changes in the Company\u2019s strategy for its overall business or use of acquired assets, unexpected negative industry or economic trends, decline in the Company\u2019s stock price for a sustained period, decreased market capitalization relative to net book values, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key distribution, change in consumer demand, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired.\n\ufeff\nThe assessment for possible impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets requires management to make judgments on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, sales growth rates, cost containment and margin expansion and expense levels for advertising and promotions and general overhead, all of which must be developed from a market participant standpoint. The Company may be required to record a significant charge in its consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or intangible assets is identified and this could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Although the Company has recorded significant impairments to certain of its intangible assets in prior fiscal years, no such impairments have been identified or recorded to its goodwill. Changes in management estimates and assumptions as they relate to valuation of goodwill and intangible assets could affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations in the future.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may also divest of certain of its assets, businesses or brands that do not align with the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives. Any divestiture could negatively impact the profitability of the Company as a result of losses that may result from such a sale, the loss of sales and operating income or a decrease in cash flows subsequent to the divestiture. The Company may also be required to recognize impairment charges as a result of a divesture.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nChanges in marketing distributor relationships that are not managed successfully by the Company could result in a disruption in the affected markets.\n\ufeff\nThe Company distributes its products throughout the world in one of two ways: the direct distribution model, in which products are sold directly by the Company to wholesalers and retailers in the U.S., Canada, Australia, China, the U.K. and a number of other countries throughout Europe; and the marketing distributor model, in which products are sold to marketing distributors who in turn sell to wholesalers and retailers. The marketing distributor model is generally used in certain countries where the Company does not have direct Company-owned operations. Instead, the Company partners with local companies who perform the sales, marketing and distribution functions. The Company invests time and resources into these relationships. Should the Company\u2019s relationship with a marketing distributor change or terminate, the Company\u2019s sales within such marketing distributor\u2019s territory could be adversely impacted until such time as a suitable replacement could be found and the Company\u2019s key marketing strategies implemented. There is a risk that changes in such marketing distributor relationships, including changes in key marketing distributor personnel, that are not managed successfully, could result in a disruption in the affected markets and that such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in some countries, local laws may require substantial payments to terminate existing marketing distributor relationships, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nReliance on a limited base of third-party contract manufacturers, logistics providers and suppliers of raw materials and components may result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and this could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers, logistics providers and suppliers, including single or sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials, packaging, product components and other necessary supplies. The Company does not have direct control over the management or business of these third parties, except indirectly through terms negotiated in service or supply contracts. Should the terms of doing business with the Company\u2019s primary third-party contract manufacturers, suppliers and/or logistics providers change or should the Company have a disagreement with or be unable to maintain relationships with such third parties or should such third parties experience financial difficulties, the Company\u2019s business may be disrupted. In addition, if the Company is unable to contract with third-party manufacturers or suppliers for the quantity and quality levels needed for its business, the Company could experience disruptions in production and its financial results could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nProduct liability claims and other litigation and/or regulatory action could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and operating results.\n\ufeff\nWhile the Company makes every effort to ensure that the products it develops and markets are safe for consumers, the use of the Company\u2019s products may expose the Company to liability claims resulting from such use. Claims could be based on allegations that, among other things, the Company\u2019s products contain contaminants, provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning their use or interactions with other substances. Product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company\u2019s sales and operating results. The Company maintains product liability insurance that it believes will be adequate to protect the Company from material loss attributable to such claims but the extent of such loss could exceed available limits of insurance or could arise out of circumstances under which such insurance coverage would be unavailable. Other business activities of the Company may also expose the Company to litigation risks, including risks that may not be covered by insurance such as contract disputes. If successful claims are asserted by third parties against the Company for uninsured liabilities or liabilities in excess of applicable limits of insurance coverage, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if one of the Company\u2019s products was determined to be defective, the Company could be required to recall the product, which could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenues and significant expenses.\n\ufeff\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s products may be associated with competitor products or other products in the same category, which may be alleged to have caused harm to consumers. As a result of this association, the Company may be named in unwarranted legal actions. The potential costs to defend such claims may materially affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s operating results and financial performance may not meet expectations which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s stock price.\n\ufeff\nThe Company cannot be sure that its operating results and financial performance, which include sales growth, net income, earnings per common share, gross margin and cash flows, will meet expectations. If the Company\u2019s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of its key goals or strategic initiatives, then the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCompany\u2019s actual performance could vary materially from its internal expectations and those of the market. Failure to meet or exceed these expectations could cause the market price of the Company\u2019s stock to decline. The Company\u2019s operating results and financial performance may be negatively influenced by a number of factors, many of which are discussed in this Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nIn addition, sales volume growth, whether due to acquisitions or internal growth, can place burdens on management resources and financial controls that, in turn, can have a negative impact on operating results and financial condition of the Company. To some extent, the Company plans its expense levels in anticipation of future revenues. If actual revenues fall short of these expectations, operating results may be adversely affected by reduced operating margins due to actual expense levels that are higher than might otherwise have been appropriate.\n\ufeff\nResolution of income tax matters may impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate and in evaluating tax positions, particularly those related to uncertain tax positions. The Company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the accounting standard for uncertain tax positions. Changes in uncertain tax positions or other adjustments resulting from tax audits and settlements with taxing authorities, including related interest and penalties, impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company\u2019s effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. Any resolution of a tax matter may require the adjustment of tax assets or tax liabilities or the use of cash in the year of resolution. For additional information, refer to the information set forth in Note 12 - Income Taxes of the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 15 of this report.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, changes in tax rules may adversely affect the Company\u2019s future financial results or the way management conducts its business. For example, the Company holds a significant amount of cash outside of the United States. As of August 31, 2016, the Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on $113.4 million of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries since these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. The Company\u2019s future financial results and liquidity may be adversely affected if tax rules regarding un-repatriated earnings change, if management elects for any reason in the future to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., or if the U.S. international tax rules change as part of comprehensive tax reform or other tax legislations.\n\ufeff\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company determined that it would undertake, in fiscal year 2017, a one-time repatriation of $8.2 million, which represents all of the historical foreign earnings from its Australia subsidiary and 90% of the historical foreign earnings from its China subsidiary. Management determined that such a foreign distribution was prudent due to the current favorable tax consequences of such a distribution, stemming principally from the recent significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against various currencies in which the Company conducts business. The Company continues to consider the remaining amount of unremitted foreign earnings, primarily in the U.K. and China, to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. See Note 12 - Income Taxes for additional information on this one-time repatriation.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may not have sufficient cash to service its indebtedness or to pay cash dividends.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s debt consists of a revolving credit facility and management has used the proceeds of this revolving credit facility primarily for stock repurchases. In addition, the Company utilized this revolving credit facility in September 2016 to fund the purchase of its new headquarters office, which will house both corporate employees and employees in the Company\u2019s Americas segment. In order to service such debt, the Company is required to use its income from operations to make interest and principal payments required by the terms of the loan agreement. In addition, the Company\u2019s loan agreement includes covenants to maintain certain financial ratios and to comply with other financial terms, conditions and covenants. Also, the Company has historically paid out a large part of its earnings to stockholders in the form of regular quarterly cash dividends. In December 2015, the Board of Directors declared an 11% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend, increasing it from $0.38 per share to $0.42 per share.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may incur substantial debt in the future for acquisitions or other general business or business development activities. In addition, the Company may continue to use available cash balances to execute share repurchases under approved share buy-back plans. To the extent that the Company is required to seek additional financing to support certain of these activities, such financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing or to service its existing or future debt with its operating income, or if available cash balances are affected by future business performance, liquidity, capital needs, alternative investment opportunities or debt covenants, the Company could be required to reduce, suspend or eliminate its dividend payments to its stockholders.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Company\u2019s business development activities may not be successful.\n\ufeff\nThe Company seeks to increase growth through business development activities such as acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing and/or other strategic partnerships in the U.S. and internationally. However, if the Company is not able to identify, acquire and successfully integrate acquired products or companies or successfully manage joint ventures or other strategic partnerships, the Company may not be able to maximize these opportunities. The failure to properly manage business development activities because of difficulties in the assimilation of operations and products, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the loss of key employees or other factors could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s business development activities will be profitable at their inception or that they will achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.\n\ufeff\nFuture acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic partnerships could also result in the incurrence of debt, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, unanticipated regulatory complications and/or increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of the Company\u2019s business development activities diminish in the future, the Company may be required to record impairments to goodwill, intangible assets or other assets associated with such activities, which could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 81294, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "WDFC"}
