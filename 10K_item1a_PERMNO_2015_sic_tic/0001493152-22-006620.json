{"cik": "1172631", "company": "Sunworks, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business and operations are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties as described below. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we may currently deem immaterial, may become important factors that could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer materially.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception.\nWe had an accumulated deficit of $115,260,000 and $88,635,000 as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We incurred annual operating losses since our inception. We anticipate becoming profitable as we increase our installation revenue and reduce our costs as a percentage of revenue. However, there can be no assurances that these actions will result in sustained profitability. We are subject to all the risks incidental to the sales, development, and costs of construction of new solar energy revenues, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\nWe may require substantial additional funding which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise the necessary additional capital, we may be unable to achieve growth of our operations.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. In order to carry out our business plan and implement our strategy, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing from time to time and may choose to raise additional funds through strategic collaborations, public or private equity or debt financing, bank lines of credit, asset sales, government grants, or other arrangements. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity or equity-related financing may be dilutive to our shareholders, and debt or equity financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs.\nOur inability to raise capital when needed could harm our ability to grow our operations substantially and could cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the duration and extent to which it will impact our results of operations remains uncertain.\nA significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the broader economies, financial and capital markets, commodity and energy prices, and overall demand environment for our products. A global health crisis could affect, and has affected, our workforce, customers and vendors, as well as economies and financial markets globally, potentially leading to an economic downturn, which could decrease spending, adversely affecting the demand for our products.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local, and foreign governments have put in place, and others in the future may put in place, travel restrictions, quarantines, \u201cstay at home\u201d orders and guidelines, and similar government orders and restrictions, in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. Such restrictions or orders have resulted in, and will continue to result in, business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, among other effects that could negatively impact our operations, as well as the operations of our customers and business partners. Such results have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAlthough we have continued to operate consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations, financial results and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including:\n\u25cf the duration and scope of the pandemic and associated disruptions;\n\u25cf a general slowdown in our industry;\n\u25cf governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions taken in response to the pandemic;\n\u25cf the effect on our customers and our customers\u2019 demand for our products and installations;\n\u25cf the effect on our suppliers and disruptions to the global supply chain;\n\u25cf our ability to sell and provide our products and provide installations, including disruptions as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home;\n\u25cf the ability of our customers to pay for our products;\n\u25cf delays in our projects due to closures of jobsites or cancellation of jobs; and\n\u25cf any closures of our and our suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 facilities.\nWe continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, including its resurgence in key markets as new variants of the virus continue to emerge. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our organization continues to operate both in person and virtually across the United States as deemed necessary by management, which entails the need for us to continue to support remote workforces at greater scale than we have before COVID-19.\nWe will continue promoting the health and safety of our employees and contractors. In an effort to protect our employees and contractors, we continue to comply with all health and safety regulations, including adopting social distancing policies at all our locations, working from home, and complying with domestic travel restrictions as necessary. We will continue to implement appropriate safety measures, including requiring employees to be fully vaccinated to access our workplace facilities pursuant to federal, state, and local guidelines, as well as taking into consideration COVID-19 case trends and related measures in our locations. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers.\nA material reduction in the retail price of traditional utility generated electricity or electricity from other sources could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe believe that a significant number of our customers decide to buy solar energy because they want to pay less for electricity than what is offered by the traditional utilities. However, distributed residential solar energy has yet to achieve broad market adoption as evidenced by the fact that distributed solar has penetrated less than 5% of its total addressable market in the U.S. residential sector.\nThe customer\u2019s decision to choose solar energy may also be affected by the cost of other renewable energy sources. Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from the traditional utilities or from other renewable energy sources would harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and could harm our business. The price of electricity from traditional utilities could decrease as a result of:\n\u25cf construction of a significant number of new power generation plants, including plants utilizing natural gas, nuclear, coal, renewable energy or other generation technologies;\n\u25cf relief of transmission constraints that enable local centers to generate energy less expensively;\n\u25cf reductions in the price of natural gas;\n\u25cf utility rate adjustment and customer class cost reallocation;\n\u25cf energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption;\n\u25cf development of new or lower-cost energy storage technologies that have the ability to reduce a customer\u2019s average cost of electricity by shifting load to off-peak times; or\n\u25cf development of new energy generation technologies that provide less expensive energy.\nA reduction in utility electricity prices would make the purchase or the lease of our solar energy systems less economically attractive. If the retail price of energy available from traditional utilities were to decrease due to any of these reasons, or other reasons, we would be at a competitive disadvantage, we may be unable to attract new customers and our growth would be limited.\nExisting electric utility industry regulations, and changes to regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar energy systems that may significantly reduce demand for our solar energy systems.\nFederal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities, heavily influence the market for electricity generation products and services. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the United States, governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies. These regulations and policies could deter customers from purchasing renewable energy, including solar energy systems. This could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our solar energy systems. For example, utilities commonly charge fees to larger, industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back-up purposes. These fees could increase our customers\u2019 cost to use our systems and make them less desirable, thereby harming our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, depending on the region, electricity generated by solar energy systems competes most effectively with expensive peak-hour electricity from the electric grid, rather than the less expensive average price of electricity. Modifications to the utilities\u2019 peak hour pricing policies or rate design, such as to a flat rate, would require us to lower the price of our solar energy systems to compete with the price of electricity from the electric grid.\nIn addition, any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce our competitiveness and cause a significant reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, certain jurisdictions have proposed assessing fees on customers purchasing energy from solar energy systems or imposing a new charge that would disproportionately impact solar energy system customers who utilize net energy metering, either of which would increase the cost of energy to those customers and could reduce demand for our solar energy systems. It is possible charges could be imposed on not just future customers but our existing customers, causing a potentially significant consumer relations problem and harming our reputation and business. Due to the amount of our business in California, any such changes in these markets would be particularly harmful to our business, results of operations, and future growth.\nOur growth strategy depends on the widespread adoption of solar power technology.\nThe market for solar power products is emerging and rapidly evolving, and its future success is uncertain. If solar power technology proves unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment or if demand for solar power products fails to develop sufficiently, we would be unable to generate enough revenues to achieve and sustain profitability and positive cash flow. The factors influencing the widespread adoption of solar power technology include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf cost-effectiveness of solar power technologies as compared with conventional and non-solar alternative energy technologies;\n\u25cf performance and reliability of solar power products as compared with conventional and non-solar alternative energy products;\n\u25cf fluctuations in economic and market conditions which impact the viability of conventional and non-solar alternative energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil and other fossil fuels;\n\u25cf availability and economics of battery storage and co-generation technology;\n\u25cf continued deregulation of the electric power industry and broader energy industry; and\n\u25cf availability of governmental subsidies and incentives.\nOur business currently benefits from the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. The expiration, elimination or reduction of these rebates, credits and incentives would adversely impact our business.\nU.S. federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation. These governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives enhance the return on investment for our customers and incentivize them to purchase solar systems. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers for energy and for our solar energy systems. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as solar energy adoption rates increase. These reductions or terminations often occur without warning.\nReductions in, or eliminations or expirations of, governmental incentives could adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to compete in our industry, causing us to increase the prices of our solar energy systems, and reducing the size of our addressable market. In addition, this would adversely impact our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds and our ability to offer attractive financing to prospective customers.\nNet energy metering and related policies to offer competitive pricing to our customers in our current markets, and changes to net energy metering policies may significantly reduce demand for electricity from our solar energy systems.\nEach of the states where we currently serve customers has adopted a net energy metering policy. Net energy metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility\u2019s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in excess of the electric load used by the customer. At the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed. Utilities operating in states without a net energy metering policy may receive solar electricity that is exported to the grid when there is no simultaneous energy demand by the customer without providing retail compensation to the customer for this generation.\nOur ability to sell solar energy systems and the electricity they generate may be adversely impacted by the failure of states to expand existing limits on the amount of net energy metering in states that have implemented net metering. The failure of states to adopt a net energy metering policy where it currently is not in place, the imposition of new charges that only or disproportionately impact customers that utilize net energy metering may also negatively impact our operations. In addition, reductions in the amount or value of credit that customers receive through net energy metering could negatively impact the demand for our services. Our ability to sell solar energy systems and the electricity they generate also may be adversely impacted by the unavailability of expedited or simplified interconnection for grid-tied solar energy systems or any limitation on the number of customer interconnections or amount of solar energy that utilities are required to allow in their service territory or some part of the grid. If such charges are imposed, the cost savings associated with switching to solar energy may be significantly reduced and our ability to attract future customers and compete with traditional utility providers could be impacted.\nLimits on net energy metering, interconnection of solar energy systems and other operational policies in key markets could limit the number of solar energy systems installed in those markets. For example, the California Public Utilities Commission (\u201cCPUC\u201d) is revisiting its net metering policy, under NEM 3.0, releasing its proposed decision in December 2021, to significantly reduce the compensation for customer owned generation and imposing fixed fees for solar customers. If adopted, the proposed decision would have an adverse effect on our business. On February 3, 2021, the CPUC said it has paused the proceeding \u201cuntil further notice\u201d to \u201cconsider revisions to the proposed decision.\u201d In addition, California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a press conference there is \u201cwork to do\u201d on the proposal. However, there is no guarantee that substantial modifications to the proposal will occur before enactment. In 2021, we generated 42% of our revenue in California.\nOur business depends in part on the regulatory treatment of third-party owned solar energy systems.\nOur leases and any power purchase agreements are third-party ownership arrangements. Sales of electricity by third parties face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. Other challenges pertain to whether third-party owned systems qualify for the same levels of rebates or other non-tax incentives available for customer-owned solar energy systems, whether third-party owned systems are eligible at all for these incentives, and whether third-party owned systems are eligible for net energy metering and the associated significant cost savings. Reductions in, or eliminations of, this treatment of these third-party arrangements could reduce demand for our systems.\nOur ability to provide solar energy systems to customers on an economically viable basis depends on our ability to help customers arrange financing for such systems.\nOur solar energy systems have been eligible for Federal ITCs or U.S. Treasury grants, as well as depreciation benefits. We have relied on, and will continue to rely on, financing structures that monetize a substantial portion of those benefits and provide financing for our solar energy systems. If, for any reason, our customers were unable to continue to monetize those benefits through these arrangements, we may be unable to provide and maintain solar energy systems for new customers on an economically viable basis.\nThe availability of this tax-advantaged financing depends upon many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the state of financial and credit markets;\n\u25cf changes in the legal or tax risks associated with these financings; and\n\u25cf non-renewal of these incentives or decreases in the associated benefits.\nU.S. Treasury grants are no longer available for new solar energy systems. Changes in existing law and interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts could reduce the willingness of funding sources to provide funds to customers of these solar energy systems. We cannot assure you that this type of financing will be available to our customers. If, for any reason, we are unable to find financing for solar energy systems, we may no longer be able to provide solar energy systems to new customers on an economically viable basis. This would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur inability to arrange financing could hurt our future business.\nWe also compete, on a cost basis, with traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers and with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies. Our advantage over traditional utilities is that we offer customers the opportunity to create their own electricity and detach from the traditional electrical grid. To offer customers this opportunity, we often have to arrange financing for our customers as solar projects have received limited financing from traditional lending sources. Our objective is to arrange the most flexible terms that meet the needs of the customer. Although we do not provide financing ourselves, we have relationships to arrange financing with numerous private and public sources, including PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) Programs, which are programs that involve both municipal governments and private financing companies that allows property owners to receive upfront funding for renewable energy projects, and agricultural financing offered by a network of lending institutions. Our inability to arrange financing through these or other sources could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we cannot compete successfully against other solar and energy companies, we may not be successful in developing our operations and our business may suffer.\nThe solar and energy industries are characterized by intense competition and technological advances, both in the United States and internationally. We compete with solar companies with business models that are similar to ours. In addition, we compete with solar companies in the downstream value chain of solar energy. For example, we face competition from purely finance driven organizations that acquire customers and then subcontract out the installation of solar energy systems, from installation businesses that seek financing from external parties, from large construction companies and utilities, and increasingly from sophisticated electrical and roofing companies. Some of these competitors specialize in the residential solar energy market, and some may provide energy at lower costs than we do. Further, some of our competitors are integrating vertically in order to ensure supply and to control costs. Many of our competitors also have significant brand name recognition and have extensive knowledge of our target markets.\nIf we are unable to compete in the market, it will have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is concentrated in certain markets, putting us at risk of region-specific disruptions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, a vast majority of our total installations were in California and Nevada. With the acquisition of Solcius in April 2021, we have reduced that concentration in California by having a presence in several more states. We expect our near-term future growth to occur outside of California and to further expand our customer base and operational infrastructure. However, our business and results of operations are now particularly susceptible to adverse regional economic, regulatory, political, weather and other conditions in the greater southwest, Texas and north central regions of the United States which markets may become similarly concentrated.\nOur customer acquisition function is concentrated with certain third-party solar sales channel partners and our growth depends on maintaining and expanding these relationships.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to develop or expand our relationships with third parties. For example, we are investing resources in establishing strategic relationships with dealers and sales channel partners, to generate new customers. Developing new relationships may not occur as quickly as planned or may not generate new customers as planned. A significant portion of our business depends on attracting and retaining new and existing solar dealers and sales channel partners. For example, we diversified our market and product concentration following the acquisition of Solcius in April 2021. Solcius utilizes a combination of authorized dealers and a direct sales strategy to generate new customers. Since the acquisition, Solcius has had three authorized dealers that combined accounted for more than 80% of Solcius\u2019 revenue for 2021. Negotiating relationships with our solar partners, investing in due diligence efforts with potential solar partners, training such third parties and contractors, and monitoring them for compliance with our standards require significant time and resources and may present greater risks and challenges than expanding a direct sales or installation team. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to grow our business and address our market opportunities could be impaired. Even if we are able to establish and maintain these relationships, we may not be able to execute on our goal of leveraging these relationships to meaningfully expand our business, brand recognition and customer base. This would limit our growth and our opportunities to generate significant additional revenue or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to retain and recruit qualified technicians and advisors, or if our board of directors, key executives, key employees or consultants discontinue their employment or consulting relationship with us or fail to properly integrate into our business and operations it may delay our development efforts or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management or technical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among solar, energy, construction and other businesses. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. If we are not able to attract, retain, motivate and integrate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the successful development of any product candidates, our ability to raise additional capital, and our ability to implement our overall business strategy.\nWe are highly dependent on members of our management and technical staff. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level, and senior technical personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers, key employees, or consultants and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, financial condition, and prospects. We may be unable to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among solar and energy companies. Certain of our current officers, directors, or consultants hereafter appointed may from time to time serve as officers, directors, advisors, or consultants of other solar and energy companies. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on any of our officers or employees. Other than certain members of our senior management team, all our employees are employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, each employee may leave our employment and join a competitor at any time.\nWe plan to continue to grant stock options, restricted stock unit grants, performance grants or other forms of equity awards in the future as a method of attracting and retaining employees, motivating performance, and aligning the interests of employees with those of our shareholders. If we are unable to implement and maintain equity compensation arrangements that provide sufficient incentives, we may be unable to retain our existing employees and attract additional qualified candidates. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and attract additional qualified candidates, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Currently the vast majority of the exercise prices of all outstanding stock options are greater than the current stock price.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments, strategic transactions, or acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nWe have in the past and may in the future, acquire companies, or enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions. For example, on April 8, 2021, we acquired all the membership interests of Solcius, for cash consideration of $51.8 million, a full service, residential solar system provider which provides proposal generation, engineering, permitting, installation services and financial solutions to customers across the country, with the largest markets being Texas, California, New Mexico and Colorado.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments, strategic transactions, or acquisitions, and these transactions involve numerous risks that are not within our control. These risks include the following, among others:\n\u25cf difficulty in assimilating the operations, systems, and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u25cf difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies;\n\u25cf difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues;\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to retain key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u25cf incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our results of operations;\n\u25cf significant post-acquisition investments which may lower the actual benefits realized through the acquisition;\n\u25cf potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal, and financial liabilities, among other things; and\n\u25cf potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nOur failure to address these risks, or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future investments, strategic transactions, or acquisitions, could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, incremental expenses or the write-off of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nMergers and acquisitions are inherently risky, may not produce the anticipated benefits and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA portion of our total assets consists of goodwill and intangibles, which are subject to a periodic impairment analysis, and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our statement of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.\nAt December 31, 2021 we wrote off $5.5 million of goodwill remaining from the earlier acquisitions of Solar United Network, MD Energy and Plan B. We have remaining goodwill of approximately $32.2 million associated with the acquisition of Solcius LLC together with intangible assets totaling $7.9 million. We will be required to continue to evaluate this goodwill and intangibles for impairment based on the fair value of the operating business units to which this goodwill and intangible assets relate, at least once a year. These estimated fair values could change if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of that business unit decreases based on transactions involving similar companies, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by the business unit. These changes could result in further impairment of the existing goodwill and intangible balances and that could require a material non-cash charge to our results of operations.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a goodwill impairment charge of $5.5 million. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a goodwill impairment charge of $4.0 million.\nWe may be subject to claims arising from the operations of our various businesses for periods prior to the dates we acquired them.\nWe may be subject to claims or liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of acquired businesses for the periods prior to our acquisition of them, including environmental, employee-related, and other liabilities and claims not covered by insurance. These claims or liabilities could be significant. Our ability to seek indemnification from the former owners of our acquired businesses for these claims or liabilities may be limited by various factors, including the specific time, monetary or other limitations contained in the respective acquisition agreements and the financial ability of the former owners to satisfy our indemnification claims. In addition, insurance companies may be unwilling to cover claims that have arisen from acquired businesses or locations, or claims may exceed the coverage limits that our acquired businesses had in effect prior to the date of acquisition. If we are unable to successfully obtain insurance coverage of third-party claims or enforce our indemnification rights against the former owners, or if the former owners are unable to satisfy their obligations for any reason, including because of their current financial position, we could be held liable for the costs or obligations associated with such claims or liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to providing electricity on a price-competitive basis, solar systems face competition from traditional regulated electric utilities, from less-regulated third party energy service providers and from new renewable energy companies.\nThe solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with large traditional utilities. We believe that one of our primary competitors (excluding other engineering, procure and construction businesses) are the traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers. Traditional utilities generally have substantially greater financial, technical, operational, and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote more resources to the research, development, promotion, and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can. Traditional utilities could also offer other value-added products or services that could help them to compete with us even if the cost of electricity they offer is higher than ours. In addition, a majority of utilities\u2019 sources of electricity is non-solar, which may allow utilities to sell electricity more cheaply than electricity generated by our solar energy systems.\nWe also compete with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies. These energy service companies are able to offer customers electricity supply-only solutions that are competitive with our solar energy system options on both price and usage of renewable energy technology while avoiding the long-term agreements and physical installations that our current business model requires. This may limit our ability to attract new customers; particularly those who wish to avoid long-term contracts or have an aesthetic or other objection to putting solar panels on their roofs.\nAs the solar industry grows and evolves, we will also face new competitors who are not currently in the market. Low technological barriers to entry characterize our industry and well-capitalized companies could choose to enter the market and compete with us. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors will limit our growth and will have a negative impact on our business and prospects.\nDevelopments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may materially adversely affect demand for our offerings.\nSignificant developments in alternative technologies, such as advances in other forms of distributed solar power generation, storage solutions such as batteries, the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. Any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay deployment of our solar energy systems, which could result in product obsolescence, the loss of competitiveness of our systems, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.\nClimate change may have long-term impacts on our business, our industry, and the global economy.\nClimate change poses a systemic threat to the global economy and will continue to do so until our society transitions to renewable energy and decarbonizes. While our core business model seeks to accelerate this transition to renewable energy, there are inherent climate-related risks to our business operations. Warming temperatures throughout the United States, and in California, our biggest market, in particular, have contributed to extreme weather, intense drought, and increased wildfire risks. These events have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and our customers, and may cause us to incur additional operational costs. For instance, natural disasters and extreme weather events associated with climate change can impact our operations by delaying the installation of our systems, leading to increased expenses and decreased revenue and cash flows in the period. They can also cause a decrease in the output from our systems due to smoke or haze. Additionally, if weather patterns significantly shift due to climate change, it may be harder to predict the average annual amount of sunlight striking each location where our solar energy systems are installed. This could make our solar service offerings less economical overall or make individual systems less economical.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers, for certain critical raw materials, components and finished products, including our modules. Any supply interruption or delay could adversely affect our business, prevent us from delivering products to our customers within required timeframes, and could in turn result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments, or loss of market share.\nOur supply chain is subject to natural disasters and other events beyond our control, such as raw material, component, and labor shortages, global and regional shipping and logistics constraints, global conflicts or wars, work stoppages, epidemics or pandemics, earthquakes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, power outages, or other natural disasters, and the physical effects of climate change, including changes in weather patterns (including floods, fires, tsunamis, drought, and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. Human rights concerns, including forced labor and human trafficking, in foreign countries and associated governmental responses have the potential to disrupt our supply chain and our operations could be adversely impacted. For example, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a withhold release order on June 24, 2021 applicable to silica-based products made by a major producer of polysilicon used by manufacturers of solar panels in China\u2019s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, over allegations of widespread, state-backed forced labor in the region. Although we do not believe that raw materials used in the products we sell are sourced from this or other regions with forced labor concerns, any delays or other supply chain disruption resulting from these concerns, associated governmental responses, or a desire to source products, components or materials from other manufacturers or regions could result in shipping, sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments, or loss of revenue and market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nDue to the limited number of suppliers in our industry, the acquisition of any of these suppliers by a competitor or any shortage, delay, quality issues, price change, imposition of tariffs or duties or other limitation in our ability to obtain components or technologies we use could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, and loss of market share.\nWhile we purchase our products from several different suppliers, if one or more of the suppliers that we rely upon to meet anticipated demand ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, acquisition by a competitor, or otherwise, is unable to increase production as industry demand increases or is otherwise unable to allocate sufficient production to us, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected. At times, suppliers may have issues with the quality of their products, which may not be realized until the product has been installed at a customer site. This may result in additional costs incurred. There are a limited number of suppliers of solar energy system components and technologies. While we believe there are other sources of supply for these products available, transitioning to a new supplier may result in additional costs and delays in acquiring our solar products and deploying our systems. These issues could harm our business or financial performance.\nIn addition, the acquisition of a component supplier or technology provider by one of our competitors could limit our access to such components or technologies and require significant redesigns of our solar energy systems or installation procedures and have a negative impact on our business.\nThere have also been periods of industry-wide shortages of key components, including solar panels, in times of industry disruption. The manufacturing infrastructure for some of these components has a long lead-time, requires significant capital investment and relies on the continued availability of key commodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to meet demand for these components. The solar industry is frequently experiencing significant disruption and, as a result, shortages of key components, including solar panels, may be more likely to occur, which in turn may result in price increases for such components. Even if industry-wide shortages do not occur, suppliers may decide to allocate key components with high demand or insufficient production capacity to more profitable customers, customers with long-term supply agreements or customers other than us and our supply of such components may be reduced as a result.\nTypically, we purchase the components for our solar energy systems on an as-needed basis and do not operate under long-term supply agreements. The vast majority of our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Since our revenue is also generated in U.S. dollars, we are mostly insulated from currency fluctuations. However, since our suppliers often incur a significant amount of their costs by purchasing raw materials and generating operating expenses in foreign currencies, if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates significantly or for a prolonged period of time against these other currencies this may cause our suppliers to raise the prices they charge us, which could harm our financial results. Since we purchase most of the solar photovoltaic panels we use from China, we are particularly exposed to exchange rate risk from increases in the value of the Chinese Renminbi.\nAlthough our business has benefited from the declining cost of solar panels, our financial results may be harmed now that the cost of solar panels has stabilized and could increase in the future, due to increases in the cost of solar panels and tariffs on imported solar panels imposed by the U.S. government.\nThe declining cost of solar panels and the raw materials necessary to manufacture them has been a key driver in the pricing of our solar energy systems and customer adoption of this form of renewable energy. With the stabilization or increase of solar panel and raw materials prices, our growth could slow, and our financial results could suffer. Further, the cost of solar panels and raw materials could increase in the future due to tariff penalties or other factors.\nOn January 23, 2018, The U.S. government imposed a protective tariff on solar panel components. The U.S. Trade Representative (\u201cUSTR\u201d) released the following terms of the tariff:\nAs indicated in the terms, the tariff will not apply to the first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cells imported in each of the four years. Panels imported from China and Taiwan previously were subject to tariffs from a 2012 solar trade case. The current tariff applies to all countries.\nAs a result of the protective tariffs, and if additional tariffs are imposed or other disruptions to the supply chain occur, our ability to purchase these products on competitive terms or to access specialized technologies from those countries could be limited. Any of those events could harm our financial results by requiring us to account for the cost of trade penalties or to purchase solar panels or other system components from alternative, higher-priced sources.\nWe act as the licensed general contractor for our customers and are subject to risks associated with construction, cost overruns, delays, regulatory compliance and other contingencies, any of which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are a licensed contractor. We are normally the general contractor, electrician, construction manager, and installer for our solar energy systems. We may be liable to customers for any damage we cause to their home, belongings, or property during the installation of our systems. For example, we penetrate our customers\u2019 roofs during the installation process and may incur liability for the failure to adequately weatherproof such penetrations following the completion of installation of solar energy systems. In addition, because the solar energy systems we deploy are high-voltage energy systems, we may incur liability for the failure to comply with electrical standards and manufacturer recommendations. Because our profit on a particular installation is based in part on assumptions as to the cost of such project, cost overruns, delays, or other execution issues may cause us to not achieve our expected results or cover our costs for that project.\nIn addition, the installation of solar energy systems is subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national, state, and local laws and ordinances relating to building, fire and electrical codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering, and related matters. We also rely on certain of our employees to maintain professional licenses in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our failure to employ properly licensed personnel could adversely affect our licensing status in those jurisdictions. It is difficult and costly to track the requirements of every authority having jurisdiction over our operations and our solar energy systems. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our systems, or changes to existing government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our systems, may result in significant additional expenses to us and our customers and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for our systems.\nCompliance with occupational safety and health requirements and best practices can be costly, and noncompliance with such requirements may result in potentially significant monetary penalties, operational delays, and adverse publicity.\nThe installation of solar energy systems requires our employees to work at heights with complicated and potentially dangerous electrical systems. The evaluation and modification of buildings as part of the installation process requires our employees to work in locations that may contain potentially dangerous levels of asbestos, lead, mold or other materials known or believed to be hazardous to human health. We also maintain a fleet of trucks and other vehicles to support our installers and operations. There is substantial risk of serious injury or death if proper safety procedures are not followed. Our operations are subject to regulation under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, and equivalent state laws. Changes to OSHA or DOT requirements, or stricter interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could result in increased costs. If we fail to comply with applicable OSHA regulations, even if no work-related serious injury or death occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement and be required to pay substantial penalties, incur significant capital expenditures or suspend or limit operations. High injury rates could expose us to increased liability. In the past, we have had workplace accidents and received citations from OSHA regulators for alleged safety violations, resulting in fines. Any such accidents, citations, violations, injuries or failure to comply with industry best practices may subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect our business.\nProblems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses, damage our market reputation, and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share.\nIf our products fail to perform as expected while under warranty, or if we are unable to support the warranties or production guarantees, sales of our products may be adversely affected, or our costs may increase, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may also be subject to warranty or product liability claims against us that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of our available insurance limits or warranty reserves. In addition, quality issues can have various other ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, loss of future sales opportunities, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation. The possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expenses to repair or replace defective products. Furthermore, widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and reduce our market share causing sales to decline.\nA failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to our interactions with current or prospective residential customers could result in negative publicity, claims, investigations, and litigation, and adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn 2021, approximately 77% of our revenue came from on contracts and transactions with residential customers. We must comply with numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations that govern matters relating to our interactions with residential consumers, including those pertaining to privacy and data security, consumer financial and credit transactions, home improvement contracts, warranties, and door-to-door solicitation. These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various federal, state and local legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or regulations, or enact new laws and regulations, regarding these matters. Changes in these laws or regulations or their interpretation could dramatically affect how we operate, acquire customers, and manage and use information we collect from and about current and prospective customers and the costs associated therewith. We strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to our interactions with residential customers. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Our non-compliance with any such law or regulations could also expose the company to claims, proceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities, as well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with such laws and regulations, and increased regulation of matters relating to our interactions with residential consumers could require us to modify our operations and incur significant additional expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems, fail to implement new systems and software successfully, or if we experience cyber security incidents or have a deficiency in cybersecurity, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information systems throughout our company to process orders, manage inventory, process and bill shipments and collect cash from our customers, respond to customer inquiries, contribute to our overall internal control processes, maintain records of our property, plant and equipment, and record and pay amounts due vendors and other creditors. These systems may experience damage or disruption from a number of causes, including power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other destructive software, internal design, manual or usage errors, cyberattacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters and severe weather conditions. We may also be impacted by breaches of our third-party processors.\nIf we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers or increased costs, which could adversely affect our overall business operation. Although no such incidents have had a direct, material impact on us, we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of any future incidents to our business.\nIn addition, numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyberattacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on internet applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data in our systems. The security measures and procedures we and our customers have in place to protect sensitive data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyberattacks, or system failures. Although we devote resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nSeasonality caused by customer demand and weather may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nWe often find that some customers tend to book projects by the end of a calendar year to realize the benefits of available subsidy programs prior to year-end. This results in third and fourth quarter revenues being more robust usually at the expense of the first quarter. However, demand for our products may be affected by changes in the buying patterns of our customers.\nIn addition, the first quarter in California, Nevada and the Northeast often has rain and snow, which also reduces our ability to install in the first quarter relative to the remainder of the year. In the future, this seasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results. Poor performance because of unseasonable weather conditions whether due to climate change or otherwise, economic conditions or other factors, could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year. Abnormally wet weather in the spring or summer months could negatively impact our financial results.\nShifts in customer demand or weather are difficult to predict and may not be immediately apparent, and the impact of these changes is difficult to quantify from period to period. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing effective strategies to counter these shifts. In addition, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality that we experience may change.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and other business practices, and of board-level oversight, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties. Consequently, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, and this may decrease the trading price of our stock.\nWe must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and to prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties. We are responsible for reviewing and assessing our internal controls and implementing additional controls when improvement is needed. Failure to implement any required changes to our internal controls or other changes we identify as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect on the market price of our stock.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act requirements regarding internal control over financial reporting, and other internal controls over business practices, are costly to implement and maintain, and such costs are relatively more burdensome for smaller companies such as us than for larger companies. We have limited internal personnel to implement procedures and must scale our procedures to be compatible with our resources. We also rely on outside professionals including accountants and attorneys to support our control procedures. We are working to improve all of our controls but, if our controls are not effective, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties which could lead to a decrease in the market price of our stock.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and investors in our common stock may lose all or a part of their investment.\nThe market prices for securities of solar and energy companies have historically been highly volatile, and the market has from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The price at which our common stock has traded in the recent year has fluctuated greatly. In addition, the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as:\n\u25cf adverse regulatory decisions;\n\u25cf changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or services;\n\u25cf legal disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and the results of any proceedings or lawsuits, including patent or shareholder litigation;\n\u25cf our dependence on dealers and other third parties;\n\u25cf announcements of the introduction of new products by our competitors;\n\u25cf market conditions in the solar and energy sectors;\n\u25cf announcements concerning product development results or intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf future issuances of common stock or other securities;\n\u25cf the addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed any financial guidance or expectations that we may provide to the public;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf our failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u25cf overall performance of the equity markets and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us or our shareholders in the future;\n\u25cf trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf ineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u25cf publication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u25cf general political and economic conditions;\n\u25cf effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events, including, without limitation, global conflicts or widespread public health epidemics like the pandemic related to COVID-19; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nFurther, the equity markets in general have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. Price volatility of our common stock might worsen if the trading volume of our common stock is low. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d could have a dramatic and negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nA substantial number of shares of common stock may be sold in the market, which may depress the market price for our common stock.\nA substantial majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock and exercisable options are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nPursuant to various \u201cat the market\u201d agreements (\u201cATM Agreements\u201d) with sales agents (each, an \u201cAgent\u201d), Sunworks has periodically sold shares of common stock (the \u201cPlacement Shares\u201d) through an Agent. Sales of the Placement Shares pursuant to ATM Agreements, were deemed to be \u201cat the market offerings\u201d as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act. The Agent acted as sales agent and used commercially reasonable efforts to sell on Sunworks\u2019 behalf all of the Placement Shares requested to be sold by Sunworks, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between the Agent and Sunworks. During 2019 Sunworks sold 2,920,968 shares under an ATM Agreement, with net proceeds for the shares of $6,694,000. In 2020 we sold 17,009,685 shares, with net proceeds of $41,406,000. In 2021 we sold 5,356,984 shares with net proceeds of $61,600,000.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, future sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Increased sales of our common stock in the market for any reason could exert significant downward pressure on our stock price.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued minimum closing bid requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) or other requirements for continued listing, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to comply with continued minimum closing bid requirements or other requirements for continued listing, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. A delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and fewer business development opportunities.\nTrading in our stock has been volatile in volume and price. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell as much stock as they want at prevailing prices. Moreover, low volumes can increase stock price volatility.\nBecause of the volatility of our common stock, it may be difficult for investors to sell or buy substantial quantities of shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. When trading volume is low, significant price movement can be caused trading a relatively small number of shares.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not expect any cash dividends to be paid on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, as well as any capital that may be raised in the future, to fund business growth or retire debt. Consequently, a stockholder\u2019s only opportunity to achieve a return on investment would be for the price of our common stock to appreciate. We cannot assure stockholders of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares, nor can we assure that stockholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nGeneral Risks\nRising interest rates would adversely impact our business.\nRising interest rates, which could be worsened by inflation or an economic recession, may have an adverse impact on our ability to offer attractive pricing on our solar service offerings to customers, which could negatively impact sales of our solar energy offerings.\nWe may not successfully implement our business model.\nOur business model is predicated on our ability to provide solar systems at a profit, and through organic growth, geographic expansion, and strategic acquisitions. We intend to continue to operate as we have previously with sourcing and marketing methods that we have used successfully in the past. However, we cannot assure that our methods will continue to attract new customers in the very competitive solar systems marketplace.\nIn the event our customers resist paying the prices projected in our business plan to purchase solar installations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth.\nOur future growth, if any, may cause a significant strain on our management and our operational, financial, and other resources. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to implement and improve our operational, financial, and management systems and to expand, train, manage, and motivate our employees. These demands may require the hiring of additional management personnel and the development of additional expertise by management. Any increase in resources used without a corresponding increase in our operational, financial, and management systems performance could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15273, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "SUNW"}
