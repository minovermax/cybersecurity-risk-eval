{"cik": "1476170", "company": "Unilife Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-10-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. We believe the risks described below are the material risks that we face. However, the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional unknown risks or risks that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline significantly. Investors should consider the specific risk factors discussed below, and the other information contained or incorporated by reference herein and the other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nMatters relating to or arising from the Investigation, including regulatory proceedings, litigation and potential additional expenses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOn May 8, 2016, we announced an investigation into violations of the Company\u2019s policies and procedures and possible violations of law and regulation by the Company\u2019s former Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shortall, and its former Chairman, Jim Bosnjak (the \u201cInvestigation\u201d) (see the \u201cExplanatory Note\u201d above for a summary of the final results of the Investigation).\nTo date, we have incurred significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the Investigation.\nThe Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits filed in connection with the Investigation (see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding such lawsuits). We will continue to incur legal fees in connection with these pending cases and, pursuant to applicable law and the Company\u2019s Bylaws, will incur expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations. The expense of continuing to defend such litigation may be significant.\nThe Company is unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these lawsuits or of similar lawsuits that may be filed in relation to the findings of the Investigation or to predict what action regulatory authorities may take, if any, in relation to such findings, or the impact (including costs) of such lawsuits and/or actions by regulatory authorities. If any of the lawsuits related to the Investigation are adversely decided, we may be liable for significant damages directly or under our indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our business, operations, cash flows and/or financial condition and damage our reputation. Further, the amount of time that will be required to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and these actions may divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nThe expenses incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with the Investigation, the impact of the findings of the Investigation, including on the confidence of our investors, employees and customers, the remediation efforts required as a result of the Investigation and the diversion of the attention of our management team that has occurred and is expected to continue to occur as a result of the Investigation, could adversely affect, our business, operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nThe findings of the Investigation could also subject the Company (or persons it may be required to indemnify) to possible criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, penalties, or investigations, in addition to potential private securities and other litigation. In this regard, regulatory authorities may consider that the loans described in the \u201cExplanatory Note\u201d above under the headings \u201cShortall Fund Transfers,\u201d \u201cBosnjak Loan Payments and Unreimbursed Personal Expenses\u201d and \u201cAdvanced Withholding Payments\u201d to constitute prohibited Company loans to executive officers and directors in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which prohibits personal loans to a director or executive officer of a public company.\nAs a result of the matters reported above, we are exposed to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. Such future investigations or additional lawsuits may adversely affect our business, operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nIn addition to the above, the findings of the Investigation may limit or even prevent our ability to raise capital, may negatively impact employee morale and may result in attrition among our workforce.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If not remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.\nManagement, under the supervision of the Company\u2019s new CEO and the Company\u2019s CFO, and oversight of the Board, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 based on the COSO 2013 Framework. Based on this evaluation, management has determined that under the oversight of the Board and the leadership of Mr. Shortall, the Company did not have an effective control environment, risk assessment process, information and communication process and monitoring activities. Additionally, because of the Company\u2019s findings from the Investigation, the Company is unable to rely on certain personnel, processes and internal controls, and as such, various material weaknesses existed at June 30, 2016. In light of such material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of June 30, 2016. In addition, the Company has concluded that, as of such dates, there were material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures (together with the material internal control weaknesses, the \u201cMaterial Weaknesses\u201d) as a result of the material internal control weaknesses.\nMaintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements and the Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses in such controls as promptly as possible. The implementation of the Company\u2019s remediation plans has commenced (see Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding such material weaknesses and such remediation process). However, there can be no assurance as to when such material weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Any failure to remediate such material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe need additional funding to continue our operations and meet our research and development, capital and general and administrative expenses. Such funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Without modifications to our existing payment obligations or receipt of additional funding, our existing cash and other sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. If additional capital is not available, we may have to further curtail our operations, or take other actions that could adversely impact our stockholders.\nOur business does not generate the cash necessary to finance our operations and has consumed substantial amounts of cash to date. We incurred net losses during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $100.8 million, $90.8 million and $57.9 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur losses and use cash during fiscal year 2017 and through at least fiscal year 2018. Without modifications to our existing payment obligations or receipt of additional funding, we will require additional capital to continue our operations for the next twelve months. As of June 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $18.7 million, restricted cash was $2.4 million and the book value of our long-term debt was $105.1 million.. In addition, at September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $6.0 million and restricted cash was $2.1 million.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and when needed, we may default under one or more of our debt obligations. A breach of any of the covenants related to our debt instruments could result in a higher rate of interest to be paid, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the applicable debt instruments to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders were to make such a demand for repayment, we would be unable to pay the obligations as we do not have existing facilities or sufficient cash on hand to satisfy these obligations and lenders could foreclose on their security interest in our intellectual property and other assets. These factors continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn February 22, 2016, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201cCounterparty SPA\u201d) with Amgen Inc. (the \u201cCounterparty\u201d), pursuant to which Counterparty agreed to purchase from the Company a new series of 6% Senior Secured Convertible Notes Due 2023 in the aggregate original principal amount of up to $55.0 million (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Notes may be issued in up to three separate closings. The Company issued to Counterparty the first Note in the aggregate original principal amount of $30.0 million on February 22, 2016 (the \u201c2016 Convertible Note\u201d) and Counterparty paid to the Company $30.0 million in exchange therefor. Counterparty may purchase up to an additional $25.0 million in Notes over the next two years, $15.0 million of which may be purchased in January 2017 (the \u201c2017 Convertible Note\u201d) and $10.0 million of which may be purchased in January 2018 (the \u201c2018 Convertible Note\u201d). There can be no assurance that Counterparty will elect to purchase the 2017 Convertible Note and/or the 2018 Convertible Note.\nFurther, we are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 and we will not become eligible until we have timely filed certain periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for 12 consecutive\ncalendar months. As a result, the Company will not be able obtain financing under the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement between the Company and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. or the equity purchase agreement between the Company and Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC at least until the Company is eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3.\nOur near-term capital needs depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to carefully manage our costs and expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of amounts paid under our customer contracts; and\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully utilize currently existing equity facilities.\nThe Company has been implementing cost reduction measures as it focuses operations on the programs of key strategic customers. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms when needed, we will be required to implement further cost reduction strategies. These reductions could significantly impact activities related to the commercialization and sale of our products, and could result in significant harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these reductions could cause us to further curtail our operations, or take other actions that would adversely impact our stockholders. If we are unable to secure additional financing on terms acceptable to us and on a timely basis, we may seek stockholder approval to downsize or wind down our operations through liquidation, bankruptcy or a sale of our assets.\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced, our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value, and such equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders.\nWe need additional funding to meet our capital needs and our debt obligations include covenants which may limit our ability to raise capital.\nAt June 30, 2016, the book value of our long-term debt was $105.1 million. The Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement and the Metro Bank Loan (each defined below) contain certain restrictive covenants. The Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants, including among other things, covenants relating to financial performance and liquidity targets. The Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement also contains covenants that, among other things, require us to obtain consent from the Lender prior to incurring certain indebtedness or assuming or guaranteeing the indebtedness of another entity or individual. Moreover, the Metro Bank Loan is secured by a mortgage lien and a continuing security interest in the personal property of Unilife Cross Farm LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\u201cCross Farm\u201d), and contains certain customary covenants, including the maintenance of $2.4 million of restricted cash that must remain in cash deposits (on which FNB has a first priority security interest). In addition, we are required to maintain a cash balance of $3.0 million inclusive of the $2.4 million of restricted cash. Furthermore, the issuance of equity securities in excess of 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock to a person or group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) constitutes an event of default under the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement. These foregoing restrictive covenants may limit or even prevent our ability to raise capital. If we are unable comply with such covenants or obtain a waiver from our lenders, then it may be more difficult for us to operate our business or we may default on our obligations to our lenders.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal period ended March 31, 2016 (the \u201cThird Quarter 10-Q\u201d) and this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which may adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nWe are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 and we will not become eligible until we have timely filed certain periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for 12 consecutive calendar months. There can be no assurance when we will meet this requirement, which depends in part upon our ability to file our periodic reports on a timely basis in the future. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public before we are eligible to do so on Form S-3, our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially having an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our new refocused business strategy.\nIn July 2016, we announced that the Company will focus primarily on active and new customer programs in its portfolio of wearable injector systems. This primary focus on wearable injectors is expected to enhance operating efficiencies and better position the Company to take advantage of commercial opportunities within the fast-growing market for wearable injectors. There can be no\nassurances that our new strategic direction will result in the commercialization and sale of our products and we cannot provide any assurances that our focus on active and new customer programs in our portfolio of wearable injector systems will be successful.\nWe have forecasted cost savings from our plan to refocus our business strategy based on a number of assumptions and expectations which, if achieved, would improve our cash flows from operating activities. However, there can be no assurance that the expected results will be achieved. The estimated costs and benefits associated with the plan are preliminary and may vary based on various factors including: the timing of execution of the plan, outcome of negotiations with third parties, and changes in management\u2019s assumptions and projections. As a result, delays and unexpected costs may occur, which could result in our not realizing all, or any, of the anticipated benefits associated with the plan.\nIn connection with this new focus, the Company has been evaluating the prospects of its non-wearable injector customer and supplier programs. The Company is attempting to negotiate terminations of certain non-wearable injector customer and supplier contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully negotiate the termination of these contracts and the Company may incur material expenses in exiting customer and/or supplier contracts. Certain of these customer contracts contain material cancellation penalties which the Company is in the process of negotiating. While the Company believes it may be able to eliminate or significantly reduce these penalties, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in doing so.\nFurther, our new business strategy can potentially present risks that may otherwise harm our business, including failure to meet customer or regulatory requirements due to the loss of employees or inadequate transfer of knowledge and negative impact on employee morale and increasing attrition among our workforce.\nWe are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are or have been involved in a number of lawsuits. See \u201cPart I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of these lawsuits. We intend to contest all of these cases vigorously and will explore all options, as appropriate, in the best interests of the Company. However, as with all litigation, there is a possibility that we will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts, or that we will enter into monetary settlements in one or more of these cases, which may or may not be covered by insurance. The time and cost of such litigation, as well as the ultimate outcome of such litigation, whether or not we are successful, could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and could adversely affect our business, operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nRecent changes in our management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.\nDuring the second half of fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented significant changes in its Board and management team composition (see the \u201cExplanatory Note - Management and Board Changes\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding such changes to our Board and management team composition). These changes may be disruptive to or cause uncertainty in our business. The failure to ensure a smooth transition and effective transfer of knowledge involving senior employees could also negatively affect our business. These matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not in compliance with the requirements of NASDAQ for continued listing, and if NASDAQ does not concur that we have adequately remedied our non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) or we do not adequately remedy our non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), our common stock may be delisted from trading on NASDAQ, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nWe were delinquent in the filing of the Third Quarter 10-Q and this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. As a result, we have not been in compliance with the listing rules of NASDAQ. On July 18, 2016, and subsequently on October 4, 2016, we submitted a compliance plan and an updated compliance plan, respectively, to NASDAQ and were granted an exception to file our Third Quarter 10-Q and any other delinquent periodic financial reports on or before November 7, 2016 in order to enable us to regain compliance with the listing rules. We filed our Third Quarter 10-Q concurrently with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, we currently believe that we have adequately remedied our non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) within NASDAQ\u2019s terms of exception. However, because the Company did not maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (\u201cMVLS\u201d) of $50,000,000 for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company is no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A). The Company has been provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until April 17, 2017, to regain compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement. If at any time on or before April 17, 2017, the MVLS of the Company\u2019s common stock closes at $50,000,000 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide the Company with written confirmation that the Company has achieved compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement and the matter will be closed. There can be no assurance that NASDAQ will concur that we have remedied our non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) or that we will be able to adequately remedy our non-compliance with NASDAQ\nListing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), in which case our common stock could remain subject to delisting by NASDAQ. If our common stock were delisted, there can be no assurance whether or when it would again be listed for trading on NASDAQ or any other securities exchange. In addition, the market price of our shares might decline and become more volatile, and our stockholders might find that their investment in our shares has limited liquidity. Furthermore, institutions whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies might sell our shares, which could have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock.\nOur fiscal year 2016 consolidated financial statements state that our recurring losses from operations and limited cash resources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our attaining and maintaining profitable operations, generating continued cash payments from customers under new or existing contracts and/or raising additional capital. In addition, our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur liquidity is highly dependent on our ability to improve our financial condition. Our failure to obtain new or additional financing could impair our ability to both serve our existing customer base and develop prospective customers and could result in our failure to continue to operate as a going concern.\nThe uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern may have an adverse effect on our customer and supplier relationships.\nOur relationships with our existing and prospective customers and suppliers are predicated on the belief that we will continue to operate as a going concern. Certain of our existing customers may terminate their agreements with us and certain of our prospective customers may not enter into agreements with us if there is uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. This may have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our revenue, which is a key component of our plan to continue as a going concern. Current and future suppliers may be less likely to grant us credit, resulting in a negative impact on our working capital and cash flows.\nWe do not expect to be profitable until we either achieve commercial scale production and sales of our proprietary injectable drug delivery systems or receive sufficient upfront fees and other payments from customers to offset our total operating expenditures.\nAt the present time, none of our customers has received regulatory clearance or approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or a foreign regulatory authority for the commercial sale of a drug-device combination product that incorporates any of our products. It is also our understanding that, at the present time, none of our customers has applied for regulatory approval of a drug-device combination product using our technology. None of our products are currently being sold by our customers with their injectable therapies. To date, we have derived substantially all of our revenue from upfront payments, exclusivity fees, device and development materials and milestone-based fees from customers. Many of our customers\u2019 injectable therapies that are planned to be used in combination with our products are in various stages of clinical development. We have a broad portfolio of proprietary product platforms, including wearable injectors, insulin delivery systems, disposable and reusable auto-injectors, pre-filled syringes, drug reconstitution delivery systems, ocular delivery systems and other systems for the targeted delivery of injectable therapies. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, research and development expenses related to the development and manufacturing scale-up of products for our customers. During fiscal year 2016, we invested $43.2 million to address our research and development requirements, including employee costs, equipment, materials, tooling, prototypes and outside contract services. We expect to continue investing in certain capital equipment to support increasing customer demand for our products and services. We will also incur significant general and administrative expenses such as assisting our customers with seeking regulatory approvals and complying with the requirements related to being a public company in both the United States and Australia. We do not expect to be profitable until we generate sufficient revenue from product sales, upfront fees, milestone-based payments or royalty fees to offset our total operating expenditures.\nIf we experience problems or delays in securing additional agreements to supply our products and services to customers, our business, including our ability to generate additional revenue, will be materially and adversely affected.\nTo date, we have signed commercial supply contracts and other agreements with several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. However, our ability to generate additional revenue will also depend on our ability to successfully negotiate additional agreements for our proprietary product platforms with new or existing customers and, notwithstanding potential upfront or milestone-based payments, to begin supplying substantial commercial quantities of such products under such agreements. Given the substantial size, complexity and long-term duration of many of these prospective agreements, they can take significant time to negotiate and finalize. We cannot provide assurance of whether we will be able to enter into additional agreements for our products or what the terms of any such agreements will be. If we are unable to secure additional supply agreements for our products and services in a timely manner or obtain favorable terms under such agreements, our ability to generate additional revenue aside from our existing contracts will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur devices will be subject to regulatory oversight and approvals either as combination products or as devices. We cannot be sure how the FDA, European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) or other foreign regulatory authority will regulate our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products or our devices and/or whether we or our customers will be successful in obtaining and/or maintaining regulatory approval.\nOur products, outside of our reusable auto-injector and certain systems for targeted drug delivery, are designed to be supplied to customers as sub-assembly components. Such sub-assembly components are ready for filling with a measured dose of an injectable therapy, and the final assembly or packaging is to be conducted by our customers or a third party. Once our products are filled, assembled and/or packaged by our customers or a third party with an injectable therapy, they will become classified for regulatory purposes as drug-device combination products. In such instances, our customers will ultimately be responsible for seeking and obtaining regulatory approval of the drug-device combination product. Each of our supply agreements that are currently in effect reflect such business-to-business partnerships under which we will sell our products to pharmaceutical customers who are ultimately responsible for the regulatory approval, marketing and sale of the drug-device combination product.\nIn order to be eligible to market and sell a drug-device combination, a customer will need to submit and receive approval of an NDA, BLA, ANDA, sBLA or the foreign equivalent of any of the foregoing.\nFor a drug-device combination product, it is possible that our customers will be required to submit marketing applications through both the drug or biologic and medical device pathways. The process of obtaining FDA marketing clearance or approval is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. We cannot be sure how the FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authority will regulate our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products, in which case the path to regulatory approval would be different and could be more lengthy and costly. We also cannot be sure that our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products will be cleared or approved in a timely fashion, or at all, which could impact our customers\u2019 ability to market their drug-device combination products that utilize our products. If the FDA does not approve or clear the drug-device combination products in a timely fashion or at all, or if there are ongoing issues with obtaining approval of drug-device combination products involving our proprietary product platforms and our customers\u2019 injectable therapies, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nMoreover, the approval process may also require changes to our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products, which could negatively affect us. As a result, our customers\u2019 expectations with respect to marketing approval or clearance may prove to be inaccurate, and our customers may not be able to obtain marketing approval or clearance in a timely manner or at all. We could face similar issues if we submit any devices to the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority for approval, as appropriate for the class of device (or other foreign regulatory processes). We may be required to make changes to our device or we may not be able to obtain marketing approval or clearance in a timely manner or at all.\nIn addition, regulatory requirements in the United States and outside the United States can, at any time, require prompt action to maintain compliance, particularly, when product modifications are required. Following the introduction of a drug-device combination product or a device, these agencies will also periodically review our or our customers\u2019 manufacturing processes and the performance of our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products or our devices.\nOur or our customers\u2019 failure to comply with cGMP, failure to comply with adverse event reporting, clinical trials and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production, marketing or sale of our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products or our devices and result in fines, delays, suspensions or prevention of regulatory clearances, closure of manufacturing sites, seizures or recalls of products and damage to our and our customers\u2019 reputations.\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive regulation by governments around the world, and if these regulations are not complied with, existing and future operations may be curtailed, and we could be subject to liability.\nOur devices and our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, Europe and other countries, including the FDA. Not only do these regulations present challenges during the regulatory approval process as discussed above, but after our devices or our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products are approved and placed in the market, numerous regulatory requirements will apply. These include, but are not limited to QSR, labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or \u201coff label\u201d uses, medical device reporting regulations and post-market surveillance regulations, and laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, advertising, marketing and distribution of medical devices, including our devices and our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers.\nAs a registered device manufacturer and supplier of the drug delivery device component of a combination product, we are subject to unannounced and preapproval inspections by the FDA of our manufacturing facility to determine our compliance with QSR and cGMP.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in an enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authority, which may include any or all of the following sanctions: fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products or our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products, operating restrictions, partial suspensions or total shutdown of production, refusing our customers\u2019 requests for regulatory approvals of their drug-device combination products or new intended uses, as applicable, refusing our requests for regulatory approval of our devices, withdrawing our customers\u2019 or our regulatory approvals that may be granted and criminal prosecution.\nThe therapeutic efficacy of certain of our customers\u2019 therapies is either unproven in humans or has only been proven in limited circumstances, and we may not be able to successfully develop and sell our products in combination with our customers\u2019 therapies.\nWhile some of our customers will be using our products with established, approved therapies, in certain instances, the benefits of our customers\u2019 therapies as injectable therapies is either unproven or has only been proven in limited circumstances. Our ability to generate revenue from our products will depend heavily on the successful development, commercialization and sales of our customers\u2019 therapies, which is subject to many potential risks. For example, data developed in clinical trials or following the commercialization of our customers\u2019 therapies may show that such therapies do not prove to be effective treatments for the targets they are being designed to act against (or as effective as other treatments available). In clinical trials or following commercialization, it may be shown that our customers\u2019 therapies interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. If our customers\u2019 therapies are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, our customers may need to abandon clinical development or discontinue commercial sales or limit clinical development or sales to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. As a result of these and other risks described herein that are inherent in the development and sale of therapeutic agents, our customers may never successfully develop or successfully commercialize their therapies or the commercialization of our customers\u2019 therapies may be abandoned or severely limited, which may limit our profitability with respect to such customers, and we may not be successful in achieving commercial scale production and sales of our injectable drug delivery systems in combination with our customers\u2019 therapies.\nCertain of the injectable therapies being targeted for use with our products are not approved, but are in various phases of clinical development. These injectable therapies may be independently terminated by our customers prior to submission of a regulatory filing or even after our customers receive regulatory approval, resulting in the cessation of any revenue associated with that contract or program.\nWe work with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are targeting the use of our products with a variety of injectable therapies. While some of our customers have approved therapies, certain of our customers\u2019 injectable therapies are not approved, and are in various phases of clinical development. None of our customers with approved therapies has received regulatory clearance or approval from the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority for the commercial sale of a drug-device combination product that incorporates its approved therapy and one of our products. The clinical development of these pipeline therapies can be terminated by our customers at any stage. Furthermore, our customers could obtain regulatory approval for their injectable therapies and their drug-device combination products that include our product, and decide for business reasons not to market and sell their drug-device combination product. Prior investments we have made in manufacturing capacity or research and development will then not result in the generation of revenue that would have previously been anticipated through our customers\u2019 regulatory approval, launch and post-market sales of the drug-device combination product within target domestic and international markets.\nOur customers may terminate their contracts or cease doing business with us in the event of a breach by us, for strategic reasons or, in some cases, for no reason.\nWhile the term of our customer contracts may be for up to 15 years, our customers may decide to terminate their contracts or cease doing business with us in the event of a breach by us, for strategic reasons or, in some cases, for no reason. In such event, we may not receive associated payments or revenue from such customer or under the relevant contract and we may not be able to recoup investments we have made in manufacturing capacity or research and development in connection with such customer or customer contract. Accordingly, if our customers terminate their contracts with us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur commercial success depends upon the attainment of significant market acceptance of our customers\u2019 product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community.\nEven if our customers obtain regulatory approval for their product candidates, their product candidates may not gain sufficient levels of market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payers, patients or the medical community to make them commercially feasible. Market acceptance of our customers\u2019 product candidates, if they receive approval, depends on a number of factors, including the:\n\u2022\nefficacy and safety of our customers\u2019 product candidates;\n\u2022\nclinical indications for which their product candidates are approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, patients and the medical community of their product candidates as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\npotential and perceived advantages of their product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nsafety of their product candidates seen in a broader patient group;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of their product candidates as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\ncost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third party payers and government authorities;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration; and\n\u2022\neffectiveness of their sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our customers\u2019 product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients or healthcare payers, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue. This may limit our ability to generate anticipated revenue from our prior investment in assembly lines and other resources. Moreover, even if we achieve commercial scale production and sales of our injectable drug delivery systems in combination with our customers\u2019 injectable therapies, such customers may face indirect competition from companies who develop and market other brand name, biosimilar or generic injectable therapies as well as alternative treatments and delivery methods that compete with our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition and/or cash flows.\nMost brand name injectable therapies will face future competition from generic or biosimilar therapies, which could significantly reduce their commercial viability.\nBrand name injectable therapies will usually become exposed to competition from generic or biosimilar rivals at some time after their regulatory approval and commercial launch. The average selling price and market share of brand name injectable therapies can be significantly diminished following the introduction of generic or biosimilar competition. These factors may result in our customers using our products with their brand name injectable therapies seeking to withdraw such injectable therapy from the market, or change market tactics in a way that makes the use of our products cost prohibitive. This may result in the termination of supply contracts and the significant loss of revenue.\nOur debt obligations include covenants restricting our business which may adversely affect us.\nOn March 12, 2014, Unilife Medical Solutions, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, or the Borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement with ROS Acquisition Offshore LP, or the Lender or ROS, as amended by the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated September 30, 2014, the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated June 30, 2015, the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated October 13, 2015, the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated December 31, 2015, the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated January 31, 2016, the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated February 9, 2016, the Seventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated February 16, 2016, and the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated February 22, 2016 (as so amended, the \u201cAmended OrbiMed Credit Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement, the Lender agreed to provide term loans to the Borrower in the aggregate principal amount of up to $70 million. The Borrower has received the full $70 million under the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement. The interest rate is 9.25% plus the greater of the three month LIBO Rate (as defined in the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement) or 1.0%.\nUnless the loan facility is otherwise terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement, the Borrower is required to repay in full the unpaid principal amount of the loans drawn down, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus a 10.0% repayment premium on March 12, 2020. The Borrower can make voluntary repayments at any time of any unpaid principal amount of the loans, plus a 10.0% repayment premium. The Borrower must make mandatory prepayments in certain prescribed circumstances, including, without limitation, certain dispositions of assets and certain casualty events. In such events, the Borrower must prepay to Lender 100% of the net cash proceeds received.\nThe obligations of the Borrower under the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement are: (i) secured by substantially all assets of the Borrower, subject to the security interest in certain assets granted to Counterparty on February 22, 2016, and (ii) guaranteed by the Company and each of its subsidiaries. Such guarantees are secured by substantially all assets of the guarantors. The security interests granted by Borrower, the Company, Cross Farm, UMSL and Unitract Syringe Pty Limited, or Unitract Syringe, are evidenced by, among other things, a Pledge and Security Agreement, a Mortgage and Security Agreement and a General Security Deed.\nThe Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement contains certain customary covenants, including among other things, covenants relating to financial performance and liquidity targets. The Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement also contains covenants that, among other things, require us to obtain consent from the Lender prior to paying dividends, making certain investments, incurring debt or liens (with certain exceptions), changing the nature of our business, assuming or guaranteeing the indebtedness of another entity or individual, selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of our assets, merging or consolidating with another entity, or issuing equity securities in excess of 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock to a person or group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act).\nA breach of any of the covenants in the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement could result in a default under that agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of 14.25% per annum plus the greater of three-month LIBO Rate or 1.0% shall apply during the existence of a default. There is also a risk that the Lender could obtain rights to the secured assets in the event we default on our obligations under the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nIn addition, on October 20, 2010, Cross Farm entered into a Loan Agreement with First National Bank (\u201cFNB\u201d), formerly Metro Bank, as amended in connection with the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement on March 12, 2014, or the Metro Bank Loan. The Metro Bank Loan is secured by a mortgage lien and a continuing security interest in Cross Farm\u2019s personal property, and contains certain customary covenants, including the maintenance of $2.4 million of restricted cash that must remain in cash deposits (on which FNB has a first priority security interest). In addition, we are required to maintain a cash balance of $3.0 million inclusive of the $2.4 million of restricted cash. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the agreement evidencing the Metro Bank Loan, there is a risk that FNB could obtain rights to the secured assets. Additionally, FNB could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Metro Bank Loan to be immediately due and payable.\nFurthermore, on or about December 17, 2010, Keystone Redevelopment Group, LLC made a loan to Cross Farm in the original principal amount of $2.25 million which was secured by a mortgage lien. Keystone Redevelopment Group, LLC assigned the loan and mortgage, or the Keystone/CFA Loan, to Commonwealth Financing Authority. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the agreements evidencing the Keystone/CFA Loan, there is a risk that Commonwealth Financing Authority could obtain rights to the mortgaged property.\nOn February 22, 2016, the Company and Counterparty entered into the Counterparty SPA, pursuant to which the 2016 Convertible Note was issued. Upon an occurrence of an event of default under the 2016 Convertible Note, Counterparty could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the 2016 Convertible Note to be immediately due and payable.\nThere are cross-default provisions in the Amended OrbiMed Credit Agreement, Metro Bank Loan, Keystone/CFA Loan and the 2016 Convertible Note, so that a default under one debt instrument could trigger a default under the others. As noted above, events of default under these debt instruments could result in the applicable counterparties demanding repayment of our debt. If such counterparties were to make such a demand for repayment, we would be unable to pay the obligations as we do not have existing facilities or sufficient cash on hand to satisfy these obligations. These factors continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.\nThe healthcare industry in the United States is subject to fundamental changes due to the ongoing healthcare reform and the political, economic and regulatory influences. In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was signed into law in the United States through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. Among other initiatives, the legislation provides for a 2.3% annual excise tax on the sales of certain medical\ndevices in the United States, commencing in January 2013. A manufacturer of a taxable medical device may, in certain circumstances, sell a taxable medical device tax-free for use by the purchaser for further manufacture (or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for further manufacture), or for export (or for resale for export). We believe that the 2.3% annual excise tax is not applicable to us because our products are sold to our customers as components for further assembly by our customers. However, we cannot give assurances that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will treat the sale of our products to our customers for use in their drug-device combination products as tax-free sales. Accordingly, this enacted excise tax may adversely affect our operating expenses and results of operations. In addition, various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the state level, or what the ultimate effect of federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on us or on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding our products and services.\nSome companies we may utilize for the supply of components are also competitors, and they could elect to cease supply relationships with us in the future for competitive reasons.\nSome companies we may utilize for the supply of components for our proprietary products also develop and market their own products that compete with ours. These companies may elect to cease supply relationships with us in the future for competitive reasons. This may disrupt our supply chain, cause difficulties in the qualification of new sources of supply and impair our ability to supply customer orders. Such events may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe injectable drug delivery systems industry is very competitive.\nThe market for injectable drug delivery systems is highly competitive. We compete against many companies, both public and private, that range in size from small, highly focused businesses to large diversified multinational manufacturers of medical devices and healthcare equipment. Our larger competitors have greater financial and human resources, distribution channels and sales and marketing capabilities than we do which may provide them a competitive advantage in acquiring new customers.\nAdditionally, while our customizable products and multi-source strategy for components and raw materials provides us significant differentiation in the medical device markets, it also makes supplier relationships a key aspect of our business model. Many of our competitors are vertically integrated and may source their own raw materials and/or produce their own commodity components such as plastics, glass or elastomers. As such, these competitors have greater control over the supply of these components and are therefore not subject to the same supply chain risks to which we are subject. Furthermore, because we do not produce these commodity components ourselves, we may need to purchase certain components from commodity component suppliers who are also our device competitors. Such supplier-competitors may have a disincentive to meet our supply chain needs on terms that are favorable to us.\nWe are also subject to competition from our customers. In particular, our customers can decide to develop their own injectable drug delivery systems internally. Moreover, we may face indirect competition from companies who develop and market alternative treatments and delivery methods that compete with our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our company and our products from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include, for example, product design and performance, pricing of our services and products, product safety, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, success and timing of new product development and introductions, intellectual property protection and our financial wherewithal and perception thereof.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries of the intellectual property relating to or incorporated into our technology and products. Granted patents expire at varying dates based on the filing date of the related application. Patents relating to our wearable injectors expire between calendar years 2032 and 2036, with some patents for other products expiring earlier. Pending and/or future filed patent applications covering relevant advancements in our technologies could extend well beyond 2036 once granted. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us with any competitive advantage or adequate protection. In particular, the injectable drug delivery systems which we are developing and for which we have filed patent applications are relatively new inventions, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain patents on these inventions. Our issued and future patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar technology or products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our technology or products. Changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries could also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing technology or products similar or identical to ours. In\norder to preserve and enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may need to make claims or file lawsuits against third parties. This can entail significant costs to us and divert our management\u2019s attention from developing and commercializing our technology or products.\nThere also can be no assurance that third parties will not assert that our technology or products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to pay substantial damages. If we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves against these types of claims, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop, delay or abandon our ongoing or planned commercialization of the product that is the subject of the suit;\n\u2022\nattempt to obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology or substitute technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nredesign the product that uses the relevant technology; or\n\u2022\npay damages which could adversely impact our financial condition and ability to execute our business plan and operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nWe, as an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer and component supplier to our customers, are required to comply with cGMP for any products we supply to our customers for clinical or commercial use. If we fail to comply with cGMP for our manufacturing facility, our business and our results of operations would be harmed.\nOur QMS is regularly audited by regulatory authorities for compliance with the requirements of, and certified to, ISO 13485, Medical Devices - Quality Management Systems - Requirements, for regulatory purposes, which is equivalent to QSR for FDA compliance. As an FDA registered medical device manufacturer, we are periodically audited by the FDA pursuant to the QSRs and cGMP with the last audit occurring in 2013 where there were no formal findings. In addition, our QMS is regularly audited by existing and prospective customers.\nIf we do not continue to have our QMS in compliance with ISO certifications or receive major non-conformances by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities during audits of our QSRs and cGMP, we may experience regulatory related delays as a result. If we do not comply with cGMP when supplying any products to our customers for clinical or commercial use, our failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf we or our suppliers experience interruptions in manufacturing operations, our business will suffer.\nWe currently manufacture our products at our York, Pennsylvania facility, with no alternate facilities available. We also use a number of suppliers to supply components for our products. If we or our suppliers were to experience a manufacturing disruption as a result of damage or destruction of the building, equipment failure, acts of God or other force majeure events, our ability to satisfy our obligations to our customers would be adversely affected, which would harm our business and our results of operations.\nThe sale of any of our proprietary products could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if our manufacturing facility fails to provide us with sufficient quantities of our proprietary products or fails to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices and in a timely manner.\nTo manufacture our proprietary products in the quantities and at the prices that we believe would be required to meet anticipated market demand of future customers, or in the event of increased orders from our current customers, we would need to increase manufacturing capacity, which would involve typical scale-up challenges. In addition, any expansion to our existing commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities may require us to either outsource manufacturing capabilities to third parties and/or to invest substantial funds and hire and retain technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience. We may not successfully complete any manufacturing scale-up activities required to increase existing manufacturing capabilities in a timely manner, or at all.\nProduct defects could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of our products involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the product can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. Any recall could result in significant costs, the loss of a customer, negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in the launch of new products.\nBecause our proprietary products, in connection with our customers\u2019 injectable therapies, will be drug-device combination products, we also face additional risks of recalls that could be caused by our customers\u2019 therapies. Any such recall could similarly result in significant costs, negative publicity and damage to our reputation, even if caused by a customer\u2019s products. We may also realize significant costs and delay in finding a substitute customer to sell into the affected market, if one can be found at all.\nWe may be sued for product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of our products carry a significant risk of product liability claims. We may be held liable if any product we develop and sell to our customers causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or consumer use. In addition, since our products will be used in our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products, we may be sued for product liability even if the claimed injury is caused by our customers\u2019 injectable therapies and not our products. We carry product liability insurance in the amount of $10 million. However, if there were to be product liability claims against us, our insurance may be insufficient to cover the expense of defending against such claims, or may be insufficient to pay or settle such claims. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage for sales of any of our products or our customers\u2019 drug-device combination products that utilize our products. If such insurance is insufficient to protect us, our results of operations will suffer. If any product liability claim is made against us, our reputation and future sales will be damaged, even if we have adequate insurance coverage. We also intend to seek product liability insurance for any products that we may develop or acquire and any of our products that are used in combination with our customers\u2019 injectable therapies in the future. There is no guarantee that such coverage will be available when we seek it or at a reasonable cost to us.\nOur relationships with customers will be subject to applicable state, federal and healthcare laws and regulations, which could result in criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third party payers will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescribing of any drug-device combination products for which our customers obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with our customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. Although we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payers, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations may be applicable to our business.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties are compliant with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve the expenditure of appropriate, and possibly significant, resources. Nonetheless, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe cannot give any assurance that we will be able to complete the development and sale of new or customized injectable drug delivery systems in response to the emerging needs of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers.\nOur injectable drug delivery systems, including customized products, are a response to changes in medical technologies, industry standards and the emerging needs of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. Our success will depend on our ability to continue developing and selling new injectable drug delivery systems and customizing our existing products to meet the changing needs of our customers. The development and customization of these injectable drug delivery systems requires significant research and development and expenditures of capital. There can be no assurance that our customization and development efforts will result in successful products that meet the changing needs of our customers.\nWe will continue to incur significant costs as a result of being a public company in both the United States and Australia.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Being a public reporting company in the United States entails significant expense, including costs required for us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, because our shares of common stock are also listed on the ASX, in the form of CHESS Depositary Interests (\u201cCDIs\u201d), we are also required to file financial information and make certain other filings with the ASX. Our status as a reporting company in both the United States and Australia makes some activities more time-consuming and costly and causes us to incur legal, accounting and other expenses that are higher than those that are typically incurred by companies that are subject to reporting requirements in only one jurisdiction. Being subject to multiple and sometimes competing reporting frameworks also subjects us to greater risk of non-compliance.\nThe costs of raw materials have a significant impact on the level of expenses that we incur. If the prices of raw materials and related factors such as energy prices increase, and if we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers, our results of operations and financial condition would suffer.\nWe use a number of raw materials including polymer plastics. The prices of many of these raw materials, such as those sourced from petroleum-based raw materials, are cyclical and volatile. While we would generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases, we might not be able to do so for competitive or contract-related reasons or otherwise. If we cannot set or adjust our prices to reflect the costs of our raw materials, our results of operations and our financial condition will suffer.\nDisruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process could adversely impact our operations.\nWe employ a supply chain management strategy which seeks to source components and materials from a number of established third party companies. Where possible, we seek to establish more than one contract for the supply of a particular component, material or service. However, there is a risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem, material recall or financial difficulties. If one of our suppliers is unable to supply materials required for production of our products or our strategies for managing these risks are unsuccessful, we may be unable to complete the production of sufficient quantities of product to fulfill customer orders, or complete the qualification of new replacement materials for some programs in time to meet future production requirements. Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials or components, and difficulty in completing qualification of new sources of supply or in implementing the use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are subject to regulations related to conflict minerals, which could adversely impact our operations.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC issued final rules regarding disclosure of the use of tantalum, tin, and tungsten (or their ores) and gold, or conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. We are now required to report on the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, as well as the process we use to determine the source of such materials. We have and will continue to incur expenses as we work with our suppliers to remain in compliance with these requirements and compliance with these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of our raw materials. We may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products. In addition, we may encounter challenges satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are unable to comply with these requirements, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition or cash flows.\nImpairment of our goodwill, which represents a significant portion of our total assets, would adversely affect our operating results and we may never realize the full value of our goodwill.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we had $9.4 million of goodwill on our balance sheet, which represented 10.7% of our total assets. We recorded this goodwill primarily from our historical acquisition activities. Goodwill is subject to, at a minimum, an annual impairment assessment of its carrying value. Any material impairment of our goodwill would likely have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nGlobal economic conditions and risks could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn recent years, the commercial and financial markets have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe. Certain of our customers and potential customers are international pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies based in the United States or in Europe. Deterioration in the global economic environment, particularly in those regions, may result in decreased demand for our products and services, downward pressure on the prices for our products, longer\nsales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. A weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers based in the United States or Europe, which could result in interruptions in supply in the future. Similarly, this international exposure of our business may subject us to less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the U.S., non-U.S. regulatory requirements, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements. There can be no assurance that a deterioration of economic conditions in international markets will not adversely affect our future results. Moreover, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of our assets and liabilities, and the amount of our revenue and expenses. We do not currently try to mitigate our exposure to currency exchange rate risks by using hedging transactions. We cannot predict future changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and as a result, we may suffer losses as a result of future fluctuations.\nChanges in reimbursement practices of third party payers could affect the demand for some of our products and the prices at which they are sold and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSales of our products, if any, may depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third party payers for the costs of our products. The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third party payers, which can vary among public and private sources and by country, may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. Reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products. Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United States or abroad, or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers, could adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for our products, which could in turn adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to successfully implement, manage and/or integrate critical information systems, disruption of these systems or material breaches of the security of systems involved in our operations may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.\nWe rely on our information technology systems, or ITS, to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Some of the information stored is commercially sensitive, such as information regarding our customers and our intellectual property. We actively update our ITS to ensure protection and to prevent redundancy. However, electronic attacks, system crashes, destruction from unexpected tragedies and unauthorized access is a common risk to all ITS in today\u2019s business world. There can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent the events mentioned or other similar instances which could have a significant impact on our business and customer relationships.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel and the loss of them could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Mr. John Ryan, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Ian Hanson, our Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice President, to provide strategic direction, manage our operations and maintain a cohesive and stable environment. Although we have employment agreements with Messrs. Ryan and Hanson, as well as incentive compensation plans that provide various economic incentives for them to remain with us, these agreements and incentives may not be sufficient to retain them. Our ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth also depends significantly upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified research, technical, clinical, regulatory, sales, marketing, managerial and financial personnel. We face intense competition for such personnel, and we may not be able to attract, retain and motivate these individuals. The loss of our executive officers or other key personnel for any reason or our inability to hire, retain and motivate additional qualified personnel in the future could prevent us from sustaining or growing our business.\nFailure to effectively execute on our cost reduction measures could result in total costs that are greater than expected or revenues that are less than anticipated.\nThe Company has been implementing cost reduction measures as it focuses operations on the programs of key strategic customers. During fiscal year 2016, the Company implemented several cost reduction and business realignment initiatives pursuant to which the Company reduced its headcount by approximately 90 employees. Such reduction is expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately $7.9 million. Subsequent to that, the Company eliminated 10 additional positions in July 2016. The Company\u2019s workforce was reduced to approximately 140 employees as of July 28, 2016, a reduction of more than 40% since January 2016 and a reduction of approximately 50% since July 1, 2015. A portion of this reduction is due to the Company\u2019s determination not to backfill certain open positions. The Company has recorded a charge from severance and related costs from these cost reduction initiatives of approximately $0.7 million in the aggregate. The Company does not believe that these cost reduction initiatives will negatively impact its ability to serve its customers. We may have further cost reduction initiatives in the future. Risks associated with such measures include adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Shares of Common Stock\nThe trading price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price of our shares of common stock may be volatile, which means that it could decline substantially within a short period of time. The trading price of the shares may fluctuate, and investors may experience a decrease in the value of the shares that they hold, sometimes regardless of our operating performance or prospects. The trading price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning our business and that of our competitors including in particular, the progress of the commercialization of our products and sale of our injectable drug delivery systems;\n\u2022\nunsuccessful capital raising activities;\n\u2022\nemployee departures;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nthe impact (including costs) and results of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or investigations related to the findings of the Investigation;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nnegative reporting about us in the press;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nacquisition or loss of significant customers, distributors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nbusiness acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022\nfluctuations of investor interest in the injectable drug delivery systems industry; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the economy, world political events or general market conditions.\nIf there are substantial sales of our shares of common stock, our share price could decline.\nAs of October 17, 2016, we had 17,342,043 shares of common stock outstanding. All of those shares of common stock other than 386,425 shares held by our affiliates are freely tradable under the Securities Act. Shares held by our affiliates are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144. If our stockholders sell a large number of shares of common stock, or the short interest position increases significantly, the market may perceive that our stockholders might sell a large number of shares, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nIn addition, as of October 17, 2016, 1,887,847 shares of our common stock are subject to outstanding stock options and warrants. We have registered the shares issuable upon the exercise of options granted under our Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan. If these options and warrants are exercised and the holders sell their shares, such sales could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the development of our business and products. Any future decision to declare or pay dividends will be made by our Board and will depend upon a number of factors including our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, under our current bank financing agreements, we are not permitted to pay cash dividends without the prior written consent of the lender.\nWe may be subject to arbitrage risks.\nInvestors may seek to profit by exploiting the difference, if any, in the price of our shares of common stock on the NASDAQ and our CDIs on the ASX. Such arbitrage activities could cause our stock price in the market with the higher value to decrease to the price set by the market with the lower value.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law may delay or deter a change of control transaction.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring takeovers, such as those provisions authorizing our Board to issue, from time to time, any series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of such series of preferred stock; prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting; requiring advance notice of stockholder intention to put forth director nominees or bring up other business at a stockholders\u2019 meeting; prohibiting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; requiring a 66 2/3% majority stockholder approval in order for stockholders to amend our bylaws or adopt new bylaws; and providing that, subject to the rights of preferred shares, the number of directors is to be fixed exclusively by our Board. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, from which we did not elect to opt out, provides that if a holder acquires 15% or more of our stock without prior approval of our Board, that holder will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to acquire us within three years. These provisions may delay or deter a change of control of us, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 93270, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "UNISQ"}
