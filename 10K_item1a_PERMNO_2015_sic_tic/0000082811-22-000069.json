{"cik": "82811", "company": "REGAL REXNORD CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations and Strategy\nWe depend on certain key suppliers, and any loss of those suppliers or their failure to meet commitments may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers for some materials or components required in the manufacture of our products. If any of those suppliers fail to meet their commitments to us in terms of delivery or quality, including by suffering any disruptions at its facilities or in its supply, we may experience cost increases or supply shortages that could result in our inability to meet our customers' requirements, or could otherwise experience an interruption in our operations that could negatively impact our business and results of operations. If we encounter significant supply interruptions, our competitive position could be adversely affected, which may result in depressed sales and profitability.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased global supply chain constraints and disruption to the operations of certain of our suppliers and we cannot predict the duration or severity of current supply-chain issues, including increased input material costs and component shortages, delivery disruptions and delays, and inflation. Additionally, the effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, long-term changes in temperature levels, water availability, supply costs impacted by increasing energy costs, or energy costs impacted by carbon prices or offsets may exacerbate supply chain constraints and disruption. Resulting supply chain constraints have required, and may continue to require, in certain instances, alternative delivery arrangements and increased costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur dependence on, and the price of, raw materials may adversely affect our gross margins.\nMany of the products we produce contain key materials such as steel, copper, aluminum and electronics. Market prices for those materials can be volatile due to changes in supply and demand, manufacturing and other costs, regulations and tariffs, economic conditions and other circumstances. We may not be able to offset any increase in commodity costs through pricing actions, productivity enhancements or other means, and increasing commodity costs may have an adverse impact on our gross margins, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are able to successfully respond to increased commodity costs through pricing actions, our competitive position could be adversely affected, which may result in depressed sales and profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition, liquidity, customers, suppliers, and the geographies in which we operate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic, demand and operational uncertainty. We have global operations, customers and suppliers, including in countries most impacted by COVID-19. Authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans or restrictions, increased border controls or closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns and such authorities may impose additional restrictions. We have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including embracing guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on social distancing, good hygiene, restrictions on employee travel and in-person meetings, and changes to employee work arrangements including remote work arrangements where feasible. The actions taken around the world to slow the spread of COVID-19 have also impacted our customers and suppliers, and future developments could cause further disruptions to us due to the interconnected nature of our business relationships.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers, as well as recent volatility in commodity markets, has negatively impacted demand for our products and could continue to do so in the future. Its effects could also result in further disruptions to our manufacturing operations, including higher rates of employee absenteeism, and to our supply chain, which could continue to negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand. Additionally, the potential deterioration and volatility of credit and financial markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the spread and duration of the virus, potential actions taken by governmental authorities, and how quickly economic conditions stabilize and recover.\nWe may incur costs and charges as a result of restructuring activities such as facilities and operations consolidations and workforce reductions that we expect will reduce on-going costs, and those restructuring activities also may be disruptive to our business and may not result in anticipated cost savings.\nWe expect to review our overall manufacturing footprint, including potentially consolidating facilities and operations, in an effort to make our business more efficient. We expect to incur additional costs and restructuring charges in connection with such consolidations, divestitures, workforce reductions and other cost reduction measures that could adversely affect our future earnings and cash flows. Furthermore, such actions may be disruptive to our business. This may result in production inefficiencies, product quality issues, late product deliveries or lost orders as we begin production at consolidated facilities, which would adversely impact our sales levels, operating results and operating margins. In addition, we may not realize the cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of such actions.\nThese activities require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work or result in a failure to meet operational targets. Divestitures may also give rise to obligations to buyers or other parties that could have a financial effect after the transaction is completed. Moreover, we could encounter changes to, or delays in executing, any restructuring or divestiture plans, any of which could cause disruption and additional unanticipated expense.\nOur ability to establish, grow and maintain customer relationships depends in part on our ability to develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation, such as IoT, and marketplace acceptance of new and existing products, including products related to technology not yet adopted or utilized in certain geographic locations in which we do business.\nThe electric motor and power transmission industries in recent years have seen significant evolution and innovation, particularly with respect to increasing energy efficiency and control enhancements. Our ability to effectively compete in these industries depends in part on our ability to continue to develop new technologies and innovative products and product enhancements, including enhancements based on technological innovation such as IoT. Further, many large customers in these industries generally desire to purchase from companies that can offer a broad product range, which means we must continue to develop our expertise in order to design, manufacture and sell these products successfully. This requires that we make significant investments in engineering, manufacturing, customer service and support, research and development and intellectual property protection, and there can be no assurance that in the future we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments. If we are unable to meet the needs of our customers for innovative products or product variety, or if our products become technologically obsolete over time due to the development by our competitors of technological breakthroughs or otherwise, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs and devote significant resources to the development of products that ultimately are not accepted in the marketplace, do not provide anticipated enhancements, or do not lead to significant revenue, which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nFurther, such new products and technologies may create additional exposure or risk. We cannot assure that we can adequately protect any of our own technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, we could be subject to business continuity risk in the event of an unexpected loss of a material facility or operation. We cannot ensure that we can adequately protect against such a loss.\nIn each of our Climate Solutions and Commercial Systems segments, we depend on revenues from several significant customers, and any loss, cancellation or reduction of, or delay in, purchases by these customers may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn each of our Climate Solutions and Commercial Systems segments, we depend on, and expect to continue to depend on, revenues from several significant customers, and any loss, cancellation or reduction of, or delay in, purchases by these customers may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of the revenues of our motor businesses from several key OEM customers. Our success depends on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with these customers. We have long standing relationships with these customers and we expect these customer relationships will continue for the foreseeable future. Our reliance on sales from customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these key customers. Some of our customers may in the future shift some or all of their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to other sources. The loss of one or more of our large customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to develop relationships successfully with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGoodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill has become impaired in\nthe future, our results of operations and financial condition in such years may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of January 1, 2022, we had goodwill of $4,039.2 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. We review goodwill at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about the future operating cash flows, growth rates, discount rates applied to these cash flows and current market estimates of value. A reduction in net income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill would affect financial results. If we are required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of goodwill is determined, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nPortions of our total sales come directly from customers in key markets and industries. A significant or prolonged decline or disruption in one of those markets or industries could result in lower capital expenditures by such customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPortions of our total sales are dependent directly upon the level of capital expenditures by customers in key markets and industries, such as HVAC, refrigeration, power generation, oil and gas, unit material handling, water heating and aerospace. A significant or prolonged decline or disruption in one of those markets or industries may result in some of such customers delaying, canceling or modifying projects, or may result in nonpayment of amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell certain products for high volume applications, and any failure of those products to perform as anticipated could result in significant liability and expenses that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe manufacture and sell a number of products for high volume applications, including electric motors used in pools and spas, residential and commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Any failure of those products to perform as anticipated could result in significant product liability, product recall or rework, or other costs. The costs of product recalls and reworks are not generally covered by insurance.\nIf we were to experience a product recall or rework in connection with products of high volume applications, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOne of our subsidiaries that we acquired in 2007 is subject to numerous claims filed in various jurisdictions relating to certain sub-fractional motors that were primarily manufactured through 2004 and that were included as components of residential and commercial ventilation units manufactured and sold in high volumes by a third party. These ventilation units are subject to regulation by government agencies such as the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (\u201cCPSC\u201d). The claims generally allege that the ventilation units were the cause of fires. Based on the current facts, we cannot assure you that these claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our subsidiary's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We cannot reasonably predict the outcome of these claims, the nature or extent of any CPSC or other remedial actions, if any, that our subsidiary or we on their behalf may need to undertake with respect to motors that remain in the field, or the costs that may be incurred, some of which could be significant.\nOur business may not generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we could become increasingly vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and interest rate trends, and our ability to obtain future financing may be limited.\nAs of January 1, 2022, we had approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate debt outstanding under our various financing arrangements, approximately $672.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $263.2 million in available borrowings under our current revolving credit facility. Our ability to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt levels will depend on our future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our current credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, our credit facilities contain financial and restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds or take advantage of business opportunities. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our indebtedness or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and debt service capability. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Our indebtedness may have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more challenging for us to obtain additional financing to fund our business strategy and acquisitions, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to interest rate changes and general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to finance acquisitions and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, manufacturing capacity expansion, business integration, research and development efforts and other general corporate activities;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our markets; and/or\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business strategies. If an event of default under our credit facility or senior notes were to occur, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for certain borrowings under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, is expected to be phased out by the end of calendar year 2023. Any disruption in the financial markets, interest rate increases, changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace LIBOR, or increases to our indebtedness levels could negatively impact our ability to access financial markets or increase our borrowing costs.\nSales of products incorporated into HVAC systems and other residential applications are seasonal and affected by the weather; mild or cooler weather could have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nMany of our motors are incorporated into HVAC systems and other residential applications that OEMs sell to end users. The number of installations of new and replacement HVAC systems or components and other residential applications is higher during the spring and summer seasons due to the increased use of air conditioning during warmer months. Mild or cooler weather conditions during the spring and summer season often result in end users deferring the purchase of new or replacement HVAC systems or components. As a result, prolonged periods of mild or cooler weather conditions in the spring or summer season in broad geographical areas could have a negative impact on the demand for our HVAC motors and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our operating performance. In addition, due to variations in weather conditions from year to year, our operating performance in any single year may not be indicative of our performance in any future year.\nOur success is highly dependent on qualified and sufficient staffing. Our failure to attract or retain qualified personnel, including our senior management team, could lead to a loss of revenue or profitability.\nOur success depends, in part, on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and key associates and the contributions of talented associates in various operations and functions, such as engineering, finance, sales, marketing, manufacturing, etc. The skills, experience and industry contacts of our senior management team significantly benefit our operations and administration. The failure to attract or retain members of our senior management team and key talent could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nMoreover, on September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order requiring certain employers with U.S. government contracts to ensure that their U.S.-based employees, contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of the U.S. government contracts are fully vaccinated. Shortly before the executive order was to take effect, an injunction precluding enforcement was entered on a nationwide basis. The executive order is currently tied up in litigation. It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact of the executive order given that it is not currently being enforced. If we are required to implement the requirements under the executive order, then it may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures\nOur failure to successfully integrate the Rexnord PMC business and Automation Solutions businesses and realize forecasted synergies from the Transactions and any future acquisitions into our business within our expected timetable could adversely affect our future results and the market price of our common stock following the completion of the Transactions or any future acquisitions.\nThe success of the Rexnord Transaction and the Automation Solutions Transaction will depend, in large part, our ability following the completion of the Transactions to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions and on our sales and profitability. To realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully integrate the Rexnord PMC and Automation Solutions businesses. These integrations will be complex and time-consuming. The failure to successfully integrate and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in our failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Transactions.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:\n\u2022 the failure to implement our business plan and for us to recognize synergies between our business and the Rexnord PMC and Automation Solutions businesses;\n\u2022 lost sales and customers as a result of our customers or customers of the Rexnord PMC and Automation Solutions businesses deciding not to do business with us;\n\u2022 risks associated with managing the larger and more complex Company after the Transactions;\n\u2022 integrating our personnel and the personnel of the Rexnord PMC and Automation Solutions businesses while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and service to customers;\n\u2022 the loss of key employees;\n\u2022 unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022 unexpected liabilities of the Rexnord PMC and Automation Solutions businesses;\n\u2022 possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, policies and compensation structures;\n\u2022 the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and\n\u2022 potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Transactions.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transactions could be adversely affected, or could reduce our sales or earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results after the Transactions and, as a result, adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nApart from the Transactions, as part of our growth strategy, we have made and expect to continue to make, acquisitions. Our continued growth may depend on our ability to identify and acquire companies that complement or enhance our business on acceptable terms, but we may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions. We may not be able to integrate successfully our recent acquisitions, or any future acquisitions, operate these acquired companies profitably, or realize the potential benefits from these acquisitions, including the expected restructuring of certain aspects of the Rexnord PMC and Automation Solutions businesses.\nWe will continue to incur additional one-time costs related to the Transactions, which may be greater than anticipated and which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and operating results.\nWe will continue to incur additional one-time costs in connection with the Transactions, including transaction costs, integration costs, and other costs that our management believes are necessary to realize the anticipated synergies from the Transactions. Although we believe our projections of these costs are based on reasonable assumptions, if such costs are greater than anticipated, the realization of these costs may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and operating results in the periods in which they are incurred.\nBusinesses that we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future, including the Rexnord PMC and Automation Solutions businesses, may have liabilities which are not known to us.\nWe have assumed liabilities of acquired businesses, including the Rexnord PMC and Automation Solutions businesses, and may assume liabilities of businesses that we acquire in the future. There may be liabilities or risks that we fail, or are unable, to\ndiscover, or that we underestimate, in the course of performing our due diligence investigations of acquired businesses. Additionally, businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may have made previous acquisitions, and we will be subject to certain liabilities and risks relating to these prior acquisitions as well. We cannot assure you that our rights to indemnification contained in definitive acquisition agreements that we have entered or may enter into will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As we begin to operate acquired businesses, we may learn additional information about them that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities, issues relating to compliance with applicable laws or issues related to ongoing customer relationships or order demand.\nThe Reorganization and the Distributions could result in significant tax liability, including as a result of an error in the determination of Overlap Shareholders or subsequent acquisitions of stock of Zurn or us. Under certain circumstances, Land (our wholly owned subsidiary) may be obligated to indemnify Zurn for such taxes imposed on Zurn.\nIn connection with the Rexnord Transaction, Zurn received a tax opinion from its tax counsel (the \u201cRexnord Tax Opinion\u201d) that includes an opinion to the effect that the Reorganization, together with the distributions of Land common stock from Zurn to Zurn\u2019s stockholders (the \u201cDistributions\u201d), will qualify as tax-free to Zurn, Land and the Zurn stockholders, as applicable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes except, in the case of Zurn, to the extent Land\u2019s payment to a subsidiary of Zurn under the terms of the Separation Agreement (the \u201cLand Cash Payment\u201d) exceeds RBS Global Inc.\u2019s adjusted tax basis in Land common stock. The Rexnord Tax Opinion is based on, among other things, certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters and certain covenants made by us, Land and Zurn. Although we believe the representations, assumptions and covenants in the Rexnord Tax Opinion to be true, the failure of any such factual representation, assumption or covenant to be true, correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the opinion. The Rexnord Tax Opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and it is possible that the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the Rexnord Tax Opinion is based on current law, and the conclusions in the opinion cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect.\nThe Spin-Off will be taxable to Zurn pursuant to Section 355(e) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership of either Zurn or Land, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Spin-Off. For this purpose, any acquisitions of Land or Zurn stock or our stock within the period beginning two years before the Spin-Off and ending two years after the Spin-Off are presumed to be a part of such plan, although we and Zurn may be able to rebut that presumption. Zurn received a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) with respect to certain tax aspects of the Rexnord Transaction, including matters relating to the nature and extent of shareholders who may be counted for tax purposes as \u201cOverlap Shareholders\u201d (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) for purposes of determining the exchange ratio for the transaction in the Merger Agreement and the overall percentage change in the ownership of Land resulting from the Merger. The continuing validity of the IRS Ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling request. Moreover, the IRS Ruling only describes the time, manner and methodology for measuring Overlap Shareholders and may be subject to varying interpretations.\nThe actual determination and calculation of Overlap Shareholders was made by us, Zurn and our respective advisors based on the IRS Ruling, but no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with these determinations or calculations. If the IRS were to determine that the Merger, as a result of an error in the determination of Overlap Shareholders, or other acquisitions of Land, Zurn or our stock, either before or after the Spin-Off, resulted in a 50% or greater change in ownership and were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the Spin-Off, such determination could result in significant tax liability to Zurn. In certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations, under the Tax Matters Agreement, Land is required to indemnify Zurn for 100% of the taxes that result if the Distributions become taxable as a result of certain actions by us or Land and for 90% of the taxes that result as a result of a miscalculation of the Overlap Shareholders. If this occurs and Land is required to indemnify Zurn, this indemnification obligation could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us and Land, including with respect to our financial condition and results of operations given that we have guaranteed the indemnification obligations of Land.\nFollowing consummation of the Rexnord Transaction, we and Land are each required to abide by potentially significant restrictions which could limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions (such as the issuance of common stock or the undertaking of certain business combinations) that otherwise could be advantageous.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement we entered into in connection with the Rexnord Transaction imposes certain restrictions on us, Land and Zurn during the two-year period following the Spin-Off, subject to certain exceptions, with respect to actions that could cause the Reorganization and the Distributions to fail to qualify for their intended tax treatment. As a result of these\nrestrictions, our and Land\u2019s ability to engage in certain transactions, such as the issuance or purchase of stock or certain business combinations, may be limited.\nIf we, Land or Zurn take any enumerated actions or omissions, or if certain events relating to us, Land or Zurn occur that would cause the Reorganization or the Distributions to become taxable, the party whose actions or omissions (or who the event relates to) generally will be required to bear the cost of any resulting tax liability of Zurn (but not its stockholders). If the Reorganization or the Distributions became taxable, Zurn would be expected to recognize a substantial amount of gain, which would result in a material amount of taxes. Any such taxes would be expected to be material to us and could cause our business, financial condition and operating results to suffer. These restrictions may reduce our ability to engage in certain business transactions that otherwise might be advantageous, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nZurn may not be able to perform the services it is required to perform under the Transition Services Agreement.\nPrior to the Rexnord Transaction, Zurn performed certain corporate and other functions for the Rexnord PMC business. Following the Merger, Zurn is obligated to perform some of these services to the Rexnord PMC business pursuant to a transition services agreement (the \u201cTransition Services Agreement\u201d) between us, Zurn and Land for a transitional period. In the event that Zurn does not or is unable to perform its obligations with respect to the Rexnord PMC business under the Transition Services Agreement, or if there are disputes in connection with the Transition Services Agreement, we may be required to incur significant costs in order to provide such services or resolve such disputes, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Global Footprint\nWe operate in the highly competitive global electric motors and controls, power generation and power transmission industries.\nThe global electric motors and controls, power generation and power transmission industries are highly competitive. We encounter a wide variety of domestic and international competitors due in part to the nature of the products we manufacture and the wide variety of applications and customers we serve. In order to compete effectively, we must retain relationships with major customers and establish relationships with new customers, including those in developing countries. Moreover, in certain applications, customers exercise significant power over business terms. It may be difficult in the short-term for us to obtain new sales to replace any decline in the sale of existing products that may be lost to competitors. Our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our profitability.\nWe have continued to see a trend with certain customers who are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase product in order to reduce their costs and diversify their risk. As a result, we may lose market share to our competitors in some of the markets in which we compete.\nIn addition, some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies.\nWe may also choose to exit certain businesses, markets, or channels based on a variety of factors including our 80/20 initiatives.\nWe manufacture a significant portion of our products outside the US, and political, societal or economic instability or public health crises may present additional risks to our business.\nApproximately 24,000 of our approximate 30,000 total associates and 61 of our principal manufacturing and warehouse facilities are located outside the U.S. International operations generally are subject to various risks, including political, societal and economic instability, local labor market conditions, public health crises, breakdowns in trade relations, the imposition of tariffs and other trade restrictions, lack of reliable legal systems, ownership restrictions, the impact of government regulations, the effects of income and withholding taxes, governmental expropriation or nationalization, and differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue.\nUnfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climates in countries where we have operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the effect of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d and trade relations between the U.S. and China.\nIn addition, as described in more detail above, the continued global spread of COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDisruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nWe have a significant number of employees in Europe and other jurisdictions where trade union membership is common. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are strong, if our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could interfere with our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could have other negative effects, such as decreased productivity and increased labor costs. In addition, if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized as a result of legal or regulatory changes which may make union organizing easier, or otherwise, our costs could increase and our efficiency be affected in a material adverse manner, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Further, many of our direct and indirect customers and their suppliers, and organizations responsible for shipping our products, have unionized workforces and their businesses may be impacted by strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nEconomic and Financial Risks\nCommodity, currency and interest rate hedging activities may adversely impact our financial performance as a result of changes in global commodity prices, interest rates and currency rates.\nWe use derivative financial instruments in order to reduce the substantial effects of currency and commodity fluctuations and interest rate exposure on our cash flow and financial condition. These instruments may include foreign currency and commodity forward contracts, currency swap agreements and currency option contracts, as well as interest rate swap agreements. We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, such hedging arrangements. By utilizing hedging instruments, we may forgo benefits that might result from fluctuations in currency exchange, commodity and interest rates. We are also exposed to the risk that counterparties to hedging contracts will default on their obligations. Any default by such counterparties might have an adverse effect on us.\nWe may suffer losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations.\nThe net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our foreign subsidiaries based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the applicable functional currency.\nThese foreign operations have the potential to impact our financial position due to fluctuations in the local currency arising from the process of re-measuring the local functional currency in the U.S. dollar. Any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the local currency, whether by means of market conditions or governmental actions such as currency devaluations, will adversely affect our revenues from our foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars. Similarly, any decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the local currency will increase our operating costs in foreign operations, to the extent such costs are payable in foreign currency, when translated into U.S. dollars.\nWorldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions and conditions in the global financial markets can affect our results of operations. Deterioration in the global economy could lead to higher unemployment, lower consumer spending and reduced investment by businesses, and could lead our customers to slow spending on our products or make it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Worsening economic conditions could also affect the financial viability of our suppliers, some of which could be considered key suppliers. If the commercial, industrial, residential HVAC, power generation and power transmission markets significantly deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected. Some of the industries that we serve are highly cyclical, such as the aerospace, energy and industrial equipment industries. Additionally, our stock price could decrease if investors have concerns that our business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions and the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities related to our current and/or acquired businesses could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nA significant amount of our revenue is generated from customers located outside of the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets and associates are located outside of the U.S. which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position.\nOur required cash contributions to our pension plans may increase further and we could experience a change in the funded status of our pension plans and the amount recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to such plans. Additionally, our pension costs could increase in future years.\nThe funded status of our defined benefit pension plans depends on such factors as asset returns, market interest rates, legislative changes and funding regulations. If the returns on the assets of any of our plans were to decline in future periods, if market interest rates were to decline, if the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation were to require additional contributions to any such plans as a result of acquisitions or if other actuarial assumptions were to be modified, our future required cash contributions and pension costs to such plans could increase. Any such increases could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The need to make contributions to such plans may reduce the cash available to meet our other obligations, including our obligations under our borrowing arrangements or to meet the needs of our business.\nRisks Relating to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and legal developments involving income and other taxes.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, and international income, payroll, property, sales and use, fuel, and other types of taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities, including claims or litigation related to our interpretation and application of tax laws and regulations, could result in substantially higher taxes, could have a negative impact on our ability to compete in the global marketplace, and could have a significant adverse effect on our results or operations, financial conditions and liquidity.\nIt is difficult to predict the timing and effect that future tax law changes could have on our earnings both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The Biden administration has provided informal guidance on certain tax law changes that it would support, which includes, among other things, raising tax rates on both domestic and foreign income and imposing a new alternative minimum tax on book income. Such changes could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current estimates. If our effective tax rate were to increase, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to litigation, including product liability, asbestos and warranty claims that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, from time to time, a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations, including product warranty and liability claims, contract disputes and environmental, asbestos, employment and other litigation matters. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability, asbestos and warranty claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. As described above, one of our subsidiaries that we acquired in 2007 is subject to numerous claims filed in various jurisdictions relating to certain sub-fractional motors that were primarily manufactured through 2004 and that were included as components of residential and commercial ventilation units manufactured and sold in high volumes by a third party. In addition, certain subsidiaries of ours are co-defendants in various lawsuits in a number of U.S. jurisdictions alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of legacy Rexnord PMC business products. The uncertainties of litigation and the uncertainties related to insurance and indemnification coverage make it difficult to accurately predict the ultimate financial effect of these claims. If our insurance or indemnification coverage is not adequate to cover our potential financial exposure, our insurers or indemnitors dispute their obligations to provide coverage, or the actual number or value of claims differs materially from our existing estimates, we could incur material costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWhile we maintain general liability and product liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are reasonable, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities that may arise. Any product liability claim may also include the imposition of\npunitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to certain state laws, may not be covered by insurance. Any claims brought against us, with or without merit, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations as a result of potential adverse outcomes, the expenses associated with defending such claims, the diversion of our management\u2019s resources and time and the potential adverse effect to our business reputation.\nInfringement of our intellectual property by third parties may harm our competitive position, and we may incur significant costs associated with the protection and preservation of our intellectual property.\nWe own or otherwise have rights in a number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture, which have been obtained over a period of years, and we expect to actively pursue patents in connection with new product development and to acquire additional patents and trademarks through the acquisitions of other businesses. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. Our inability to protect this intellectual property generally, or the illegal breach of some or a large group of our intellectual property rights, would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that our intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, significant costs associated with defending challenges to our intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could adversely impact our cash flow and results of operations.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could incur significant costs and expenses or be prevented from selling certain products.\nWe may be subject to claims from third parties that our products or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights or that we have misappropriated intellectual property rights. If we are involved in a dispute or litigation relating to infringement of third party intellectual property rights, we could incur significant costs in defending against those claims. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to technology that are important to our business, or be required to pay damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe may incur costs or suffer reputational damage due to improper conduct of our associates, agents or business partners.\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations relating to improper payments to government officials, bribery, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. If our associates, agents or business partners engage in activities in violation of these laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions, may incur costs associated with government investigations, or may suffer damage to our reputation.\nOur operations are highly dependent on information technology infrastructure, and failures, attacks or breaches could significantly affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on our information technology infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives. If we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure, such as a computer virus, a problem with the functioning of an important IT application, or an intentional disruption of our IT systems by a third party, the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, including costs relating to investigation and remediation actions.\nIT security threats via computer malware and other \u201ccyber-attacks,\u201d which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, could also result in unauthorized disclosures of information, such as customer data, personally identifiable information or other confidential or proprietary material, and create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, or damage our reputation. Moreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks, and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these attacks may have. While we maintain robust information security mechanisms and controls, the impact of a material IT event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nWe have substantially completed the implementation of two Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems that each redesigned and deployed common information systems. We will continue to implement the ERP systems throughout the business. The process of implementation can be costly and can divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of the business. As we implement the ERP systems, some elements may not perform as expected. This could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety and expect incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with any environmental regulations, including more stringent environmental laws that may be imposed in the future, could subject us to future liabilities, fines or penalties or the suspension of production. In addition, if environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are repealed, made less burdensome or implemented at a later date, demand for our products designed to comply with such regulations may be unfavorably impacted.\nGeneral Risks\nOur operations can be negatively impacted by natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflict, political and governmental actions which could harm our business.\nNatural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the actions taken by the US and other governments in response to such events could cause damage or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers, or our customers, and could create political or economic instability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our products, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, or could disrupt our supply chain. We may also be negatively impacted by actions by the U.S. or foreign governments which could disrupt manufacturing and commercial operations, including policy changes affecting taxation, trade, immigration, currency devaluation, tariffs, customs, border actions and the like, including, for example, the effect of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d and trade relations between the U.S. and China.\nOur stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. Among the factors that could affect our common stock price are those discussed above under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d as well as:\n\u2022domestic and international economic and political factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022quarterly fluctuation in our operating income and earnings per share results;\n\u2022decline in demand for our products;\n\u2022significant strategic actions by our competitors, including new product introductions or technological advances;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022cost increases in energy, raw materials, intermediate components or materials, or labor; and\n\u2022changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts.\nIn addition, stock markets may experience extreme volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 58771, "SIC": 3621, "TIC": "RBC"}
