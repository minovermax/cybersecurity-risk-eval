RISK FACTORS\nRisks and Uncertainties\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risks highlight some of the more significant factors that have affected us and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently believe are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in our common stock.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits.\nWe evaluate acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business. We can give no assurances that the opportunities will be consummated or that financing will be available. In addition, acquisitions involve inherent risks that the acquired business will not perform in accordance with our expectations. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from the integration as successfully or rapidly as projected, if at all. Our failure to integrate newly-acquired operations could prevent us from realizing our expected rate of return on an acquired business and could have a material or adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nProlonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.\nWe could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative changes in economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers as well as the capital markets. Negative changes in government spending may result in delayed or permanent deferrals of existing or potential projects. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer orders and payments, and access to available capital resources outside of operations.\nIn addition, current volatile market conditions and significant fluctuations in energy prices may continue for an extended period, negatively affecting our business prospects. The oil and gas markets are currently very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Any prolonged substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations, and financial condition.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company has financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk and consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Company routinely maintains cash and temporary cash investments at certain financial institutions in amounts substantially in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) and other jurisdictions insurance limits. Management believes that these financial institutions are of high quality and the risk of loss is minimal.\nOur ability to maintain or improve our profitability could be adversely impacted by cost pressures as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur profitability is dependent upon the efficient use of our resources. Rising inflation, labor costs, labor disruptions, and other increases in costs in the geographies where we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.\nThe majority of our products and services are sold in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Fluctuations in the relative values of the United States dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro will require adjustments in reported earnings and operations to reflect exchange rate translation in our Canadian and European sales and operations. If the United States dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar,\nBritish pound, or Euro, our reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the United States dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro.\nOur business operates in highly competitive industries and a failure to react to changing market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nWe face strong competition in each of the markets in which we participate. A slow response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines could negatively impact our overall pricing. Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories. We may be required to invest more heavily to maintain and expand our product offerings. There can be no assurance that new product offerings will be widely accepted in the markets we serve. Significant negative developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.\nWe own a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries where product sales are possible. However, we have not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property for all products in all countries. The decision not to obtain patent and trademark protection in other countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon our proprietary intellectual property. This could impede growth into new markets where we do not have such protections and result in a greater supply of similar products in such markets, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nOur business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property, and personal identification information. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability, and harm our reputation and business. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers\u2019 willingness to transact business with us, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nWe are dependent upon key customers.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers. A significant decrease in capital spending by our railroad customers could negatively impact our product revenue. Our CXT concrete rail products division and ARP division are dependent on the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) for a significant portion of their business. No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a customer, or customers, would not impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nAn adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation or pending or future warranty claims against the Company or its subsidiaries or our determination that a customer has a substantial product warranty claim could negatively impact our financial results and/or our financial condition.\nWe are party to various legal proceedings. In addition, from time to time our customers assert claims against us relating to the warranties which apply to products we sell. There is the potential that a result materially adverse to us or our subsidiaries in pending or future legal proceedings or pending or future product warranty claims could materially exceed any accruals we have established and adversely affect our financial results and/or\nfinancial condition. In January 2015 the UPRR filed a lawsuit against the Company asserting that we were in material breach of our 2012 amended supply agreement with the UPRR due to claimed failures to provide warranty ties to replace alleged defective concrete ties. UPRR seeks various types of relief including incidental, consequential, and other damages in amounts to be determined at trial under various legal theories. See \u201cExecutive Level Overview\u201d for additional information regarding the UPRR\u2019s lawsuit. We continue to work with UPRR in an attempt to reach a resolution on this matter. However, we cannot predict that such discussions will be successful, the results of litigation, or whether any settlement or judgment amounts will be within the range of our estimated accruals for loss contingencies. Consequently, while we believe the claims in the UPRR lawsuit case are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves, an adverse outcome could result in a substantial judgment against us that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. No assurances can be given that our current estimate of the number of defective concrete ties that need to be replaced will not increase and result in our having to take additional charges, or that UPRR will not terminate the 2012 amended supply agreement and recover damages under its lawsuit, which events could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources.\nA portion of our sales are derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.\nDoing business outside the United States subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic climate and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts, and unexpected changes in United States and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments, and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign countries exposes the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, unable to alter its business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.\nViolations of foreign governmental regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers or both and could adversely affect our business.\nOur foreign operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate as well as U.S. laws. These include regulations relating to currency conversion, repatriation of earnings, taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel, and the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers, including, in some jurisdictions, mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar other worldwide anti-corruption laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, prohibit improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have established an internal control structure, corporate policies, compliance, and training processes to reduce the risk of violation, we cannot ensure that these procedures will protect us from violations of such policies by our employees or agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and suspension or debarment from contracting. Events of non-compliance could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Violations of such laws or allegations of violation could disrupt our business and result in material adverse results to our operating results or future profitability.\nCertain divisions of our business depend on a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nIn our rail and piling distributed products businesses, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers. No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business of one or more of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us, or a disruption in the availability of existing and new piling and rail products would not adversely impact our financial results.\nFluctuations in the price, quality, and availability of the primary raw materials used in our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nMost of our businesses utilize steel as a significant product component. The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles as well as to international market forces. We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our concrete railroad tie and our precast concrete products businesses. No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.\nLabor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nFour of our manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 190 employees employed at these facilities are currently working under three separate collective bargaining agreements.\nIn March 2014, we negotiated the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with our Bedford, PA workforce represented by the Shopman\u2019s Local Union Number 527. This agreement, covering approximately 50 employees, expires in March 2017.\nIn September 2014, we negotiated the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with our Spokane, WA workforce represented by the United Steelworkers Local Number 338. This agreement, covering approximately 110 employees, expires in September 2017.\nThe bargaining unit in our St. Jean, Quebec, Canada workforce is represented by the Canadian Steel Workers Union Local Number 9443. This agreement, covering approximately 30 employees, was finalized in November 2013. A five year agreement was ratified that will expire in August 2018.\nThese collective bargaining agreements forbid the respective labor organizations from endorsing any work stoppage during the life of the agreements.\nOur success is highly dependent on the continued service and availability of qualified personnel.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, the executive team, and other highly skilled employees. Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to compete and lead to a reduction in our profitability.\nOur future performance and market value could cause write-downs of intangible assets in future periods.\nWe are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to review intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered to be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. No assurances can be given that we will not be required to record a significant adverse charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or intangible assets occurs.\nWe may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business.\nUnexpected events including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, armed conflicts, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or a disruption in certain of our operations may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise impact our financial performance.\nShifting federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory policies impose risks to our operations.\nWe are subject to regulation from federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous authorizations, permits, approvals, and certificates from governmental agencies. Compliance with emerging regulatory initiatives, delays, discontinuations, or reversals of existing regulatory policies in the markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our operations are heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects. Many of these projects have \u201cBuy America\u201d or \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions. Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results. Additionally, government actions concerning \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.\nWe may be impacted by new regulations related to conflict minerals.\nThe SEC, as directed in The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, adopted new rules establishing disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of certain minerals referred to as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in products. These new rules require us to determine, disclose, and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. The requirements could affect the sourcing, availability, and cost of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of the products we sell, including some that we contract to manufacture. In addition, our customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflict-free minerals at a reasonable price. We may face reputation challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of all minerals used in our products.", "PERMNO": 37402, "SIC": 5051, "TIC": "FSTR"}
