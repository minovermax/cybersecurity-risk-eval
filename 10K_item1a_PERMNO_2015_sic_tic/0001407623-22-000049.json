Risk Factors\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be or in the future may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or a future public health crisis.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on the businesses of tenants at the Company\u2019s properties and, as a result, on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. The Company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under lease agreements at the Company\u2019s properties and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s business is dependent on the ability of tenants to meet their obligations to the Company under such lease agreements. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the businesses of the Company\u2019s tenants, and the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments which are still uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and remaining duration of the pandemic, the severity of COVID-19 variants, the administration and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, the implementation of restrictions on tenant businesses to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic and social effects of the pandemic and such containment measures, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted states and cities where the Company\u2019s tenants operate their businesses and where the Company\u2019s properties are located, and local, state and federal authorities have, at various times throughout the pandemic, taken preventative measures to alleviate the public health crisis including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, mandatory business closures and restrictions on business operations, quarantines, restrictions on travel, restrictions on gatherings, social distancing practices, showing proof of vaccinations and face coverings. These preventative measures have affected the operations of the Company\u2019s tenant base to varying degrees depending on the category and location of the tenant. For example, following the COVID-19 outbreak, grocery stores, pharmacies and retail stores were generally permitted to remain open and operational (with capacity limitations in the case of certain retail stores), restaurants in certain states such as California, Washington, and Oregon were generally limited to take-out and delivery services and outdoor-dining only or subject to capacity limitations when indoor dining was permitted, and bars, movie theaters, gyms and salons in certain states and counties were generally forced to close indoor operations for periods of time. Even as efforts to contain the pandemic, including vaccinations, have made progress and many restrictions have been relaxed or lifted, resurgences and new variants of the virus have caused and may continue to cause additional outbreaks and there is substantial uncertainty about the nature and degree of the continued effects of COVID-19 over time, including whether customers will re-engage with tenants to the extent they have in the past.\nA number of the Company\u2019s tenants operate service and retail businesses that require in-person interactions with their customers to generate revenues, and the spread of COVID-19 has decreased customers\u2019 willingness to frequent certain of the Company\u2019s tenants\u2019 physical store locations and has led to a general increase in online consumer purchases through retail websites. There is no guarantee that this trend towards making purchases of goods online will not continue in the future even after the abatement of the COVID-19 pandemic. A prolonged or permanent decrease in customer traffic could make it difficult for the Company to renew or re-lease the Company\u2019s properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates, and the Company could incur substantial tenant improvement and other leasing costs. One or more of the Company\u2019s tenants may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which could result in the termination of its lease causing a reduction in the Company\u2019s income. Tenant bankruptcies may also make it more difficult for the Company to lease the remainder of the property or properties in which the bankrupt tenant operates and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to successfully execute the Company\u2019s re-leasing strategy. Further, in the event of any default by a tenant under its lease agreement, the Company might not be able to fully recover and/or experience delays and additional costs in enforcing the Company\u2019s rights as landlord to recover amounts due to the Company under the terms of the lease agreement, and any vacancies resulting from such defaults or tenant bankruptcies could result in an increase in the number of co-tenancy claims if the occupancy at the Company\u2019s properties falls below required thresholds.\nAs a result of these and other factors, certain of the Company\u2019s tenants have experienced and continue to experience economic difficulties which may cause them to be unable to meet their obligations to the Company under their lease agreements in full, or at all. A number of the Company\u2019s tenants have sought to modify such obligations and, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has entered into lease concessions that deferred approximately $11.1 million of contractual amounts billed. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $5.6 million of such amount has been rebilled in accordance with the underlying agreements, of which approximately $4.8 million has been collected. Tenants with whom the Company has entered into lease concessions may continue to seek additional relief, and additional tenants may seek modifications of such obligations in the future, resulting in increases in uncollectible receivables and reductions in rental income. If a significant number of tenants are unable to meet their obligations to the Company, whether due to poor operating results, lack of liquidity or other reasons, the Company\u2019s business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects and ability to service its debt obligations and pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, or a future public health crisis, could have material and adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects and ability to service the Company\u2019s debt obligations and the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends and other distributions to the Company\u2019s stockholders due to, among other factors:\n\u2022difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect the Company\u2019s access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis and the Company\u2019s tenants\u2019 abilities to fund their business operations and meet their obligations to the Company;\n\u2022the financial impact could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company\u2019s stockholders;\n\u2022the financial impacts could negatively impact the Company\u2019s future compliance with financial covenants of the Company\u2019s credit facility and other debt agreements and could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could also negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to make additional borrowings under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility or otherwise pay dividends to the Company\u2019s stockholders;\n\u2022the worsening of estimated future cash flows due to a change in the Company\u2019s plans, policies, or views of market and economic conditions as it relates to one or more of the Company\u2019s adversely impacted properties could result in the recognition of substantial impairment charges imposed on the Company\u2019s assets;\n\u2022the credit quality of the Company\u2019s tenants could be negatively impacted and the Company may significantly increase the Company\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts;\n\u2022a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability or desire to grow the Company\u2019s portfolio of properties, or to sell properties as part of the Company\u2019s capital recycling strategy;\n\u2022a prolonged or significant downturn in the U.S. economy resulting from COVID-19 or a future public health crisis could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to lease space and negotiate and maintain favorable rents, which could lead to a decline in occupancy and rental revenues;\n\u2022difficulties completing the Company\u2019s densification projects on a timely basis, on budget or at all; and\n\u2022the potential negative impact on the health of the Company\u2019s personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact, or a future public health crisis could impact, the Company\u2019s operations and those of the Company\u2019s tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of such pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others, which could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s revenues and could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, many risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Operations\nThere are risks relating to investments in real estate.\nReal property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Real estate values are affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the general economic climate, local conditions (such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area), the quality and philosophy of management, competition from other available space, the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and to control variable operating costs, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist activities and other factors in the areas in which the properties are located. Shopping centers, in particular, may be affected by changing perceptions of retailers or shoppers regarding the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center, increasing consumer purchases through online retail websites and catalogs, the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector and by the overall climate for the retail industry generally. Real estate values are also affected by such factors as government regulations, interest rate levels, the availability of financing and potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, tax and other laws. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s income is derived from rental income from real property. The Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to service its debt obligations could be materially and adversely affected if a significant number of its tenants were unable to meet their obligations, or if it were unable to lease on economically favorable terms a significant amount of space in its properties. In the event of default by a tenant, the Company may experience delays in enforcing, and incur substantial costs to enforce, its rights as a landlord. In addition, certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive market and competition may limit its ability to acquire desirable assets and to attract and retain tenants.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive market. The Company\u2019s profitability depends, in large part, on its ability to acquire its assets at favorable prices and on trends impacting the retail industry in general, national, regional and local economic conditions, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, marketing and other resources than it does. Other entities may raise significant amounts of capital and may have investment objectives that overlap with the Company\u2019s. In addition, the properties that the Company acquires may face competition from similar properties in the same market, as well as from e-commerce websites. The presence of competitive alternatives affects the Company\u2019s ability to lease space and the level of rents it can obtain. New construction, renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect the Company\u2019s properties.\nThe Company may change any of its strategies, policies or procedures without stockholder consent, which could materially and adversely affect its business.\nThe Company may change any of its strategies, policies or procedures with respect to acquisitions, asset allocation, growth, operations, indebtedness, financing strategy and distributions, including those related to maintaining its REIT qualification, at any time without the consent of its stockholders, which could result in making acquisitions that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the types of acquisitions described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A change in the Company\u2019s strategy may increase its exposure to real estate market fluctuations, financing risk, default risk and interest rate risk. Furthermore, a change in the Company\u2019s asset allocation could result in the Company making acquisitions in asset categories different from those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These changes could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s directors are subject to potential conflicts of interest.\nThe Company\u2019s executive officers and directors may face conflicts of interest. Except for Messrs. Tanz, Haines and Schoebel, none of the Company\u2019s executive officers or directors are required to commit substantially all of their business time to the Company. Also, in the course of their other business activities, the Company\u2019s directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to the Company as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. They may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nAs a result of multiple business affiliations, the Company\u2019s non-management directors may have legal obligations relating to presenting opportunities to acquire one or more properties, portfolios or real estate-related debt investments to other entities. The Company\u2019s non-management directors (including the Company\u2019s non-executive Chairman) may present such opportunities to the other entities to which they owe pre-existing fiduciary duties before presenting such opportunities to the Company. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise when the Company\u2019s board of directors evaluates a particular opportunity.\nCapital markets and economic conditions can materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, its results of operations and the value of its assets.\nThere are many factors that can affect the value of the Company\u2019s assets, including the state of the capital markets and economy. Any reduction in available financing may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its financial objectives. Concern about the stability of the markets generally may limit the Company\u2019s ability and the ability of its tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. Although the Company will factor in these conditions in acquiring its assets, its long-term success depends in part on general economic conditions and the stability and dependability of the financing market for retail real estate. If the national economy or the local economies in which the Company operates were to experience uncertainty, or if general economic conditions were to worsen, the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders could be materially and adversely affected.\nBankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease the Company\u2019s revenues and available cash.\nIn the case of many retail properties, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause the Company to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties and could allow other tenants to exercise so-called \u201ckick-out\u201d clauses in their leases and terminate their lease or reduce their rents prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of major tenants could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nInflation or deflation may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and distributions to its stockholders.\nIncreased inflation could have a pronounced negative impact on the Company\u2019s property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than the Company\u2019s rents. Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact the Company\u2019s tenants\u2019 sales and, in turn, the Company\u2019s percentage rents, where applicable, and the willingness and ability of tenants to enter into or renew leases and/or honor their obligations under existing leases. Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income.\nCompliance or failure to comply with safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.\nThe Company\u2019s properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If the Company fails to comply with these requirements, it could incur fines or private damage awards. The Company does not know whether compliance with the requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that could affect its income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects and ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nThe Company expects to acquire additional properties and this may create risks.\nThe Company expects to acquire additional properties consistent with its investment strategies. The Company may not, however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions on time, within budget or at all. In addition, the Company may face competition in pursuing acquisition opportunities, which could result in increased acquisition costs. When the Company does pursue a project or acquisition, it may not succeed in leasing newly acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover its costs of acquisition. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could result in poorer than anticipated performance. The Company may also abandon acquisition opportunities that it has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred. Furthermore, acquisitions of new properties will expose the Company to the liabilities of those properties, including, for example, liabilities for clean-up of disclosed or undisclosed environmental contamination,\nclaims by persons in respect of events transpiring or conditions existing before the Company\u2019s acquisition and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of properties.\nIn the event the Company seeks to redevelop existing properties, these projects could be subject to delays or other risks and might not yield the returns anticipated, which would harm the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company may selectively engage in redevelopment projects at certain of its properties. To the extent the Company enters into redevelopment projects, it will be subject to a number of risks that could negatively affect its return on investment, financial condition, results of operations and the Company\u2019s ability to make distributions to stockholders, including, among others:\n\u2022higher than anticipated construction costs, including labor, materials and higher than anticipated financing costs;\n\u2022delayed ability or inability to reach projected occupancy, rental rates, profitability, and investment return;\n\u2022timing delays due to weather, labor disruptions, zoning or other regulatory approvals, tenant decision delays, delays in anchor approvals of redevelopment plans, where required, acts of God (such as fires, significant storms, earthquakes or floods) and other factors outside the Company\u2019s control, which might make a project less profitable or unprofitable, or delay profitability; and\n\u2022expenditure of money and time on projects that might be significantly delayed before stabilization.\nIf a project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting its expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning, the Company could lose its investment in the project or have to incur an impairment charge relating to the asset or development which could then adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company faces risks associated with the development and redevelopment of mixed-use commercial properties.\nThe Company may continue to expand its investment focus to include more complex mixed-use development and redevelopment projects that pose unique risks to the Company\u2019s return on investment. Mixed-use projects refer to real estate projects that, in addition to retail space, may also include space for residential, office, hotel or other commercial purposes. The Company has less experience in developing and redeveloping and managing non-retail real estate than it does retail real estate. As a result, if a development or redevelopment project includes a non-retail use, the Company may seek to develop that component itself, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer, or partner with a developer. The Company may be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development or redevelopment of retail real estate, but also to risks associated with developing, owning, operating or selling non-retail real estate, with which the Company has less experience, including but not limited to complex entitlement processes. These unique risks may adversely impact the return on investment in these mixed-use development or redevelopment projects. If the Company sells the non-retail components, the Company\u2019s retail component may be impacted by the decisions made by the other owners, and actions of those occupying the non-retail spaces in these mixed-use properties. If the Company partners with a developer, the Company might be dependent upon the partner\u2019s ability to perform and to agree on major decisions that impact the Company\u2019s investment returns of the project. In addition, there is a risk that the non-retail developer may default on its obligations necessitating that the Company complete the other components itself, including providing necessary financing.\nFactors affecting the general retail environment could adversely affect the financial condition of the Company\u2019s retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in its shopping centers, and in turn, materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s properties are focused on the retail real estate market. This means that the performance of the Company\u2019s properties will be impacted by general retail market conditions, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, changing perceptions of retailers or shoppers regarding the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the shopping centers, and increasing competition from online retail websites and catalog companies. In addition, the retail business is highly competitive and the Company\u2019s tenants may fail to differentiate their shopping experiences, create an attractive value proposition or execute their business strategies. Furthermore, the Company believes that the increase in digital and mobile technology usage has increased the speed of the transition from shopping at physical locations to web-based purchases and that its tenants may be negatively affected by these changing consumer spending habits. These conditions could adversely affect the financial condition of the Company\u2019s retail tenants and the willingness and ability of retailers to lease space, or renew existing\nleases, in the Company\u2019s shopping centers and to honor their obligations under existing leases, and in turn, materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s growth depends on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future.\nIn order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company is required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \u201cCode\u201d) to annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, the Company may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisitions, from income from operations. After the Company invests its cash on hand, it expects to depend primarily on the credit facility and other external financing (including debt and equity financings) to fund the growth of its business. The Company\u2019s access to debt or equity financing depends on the willingness of third parties to lend or make equity investments and on conditions in the capital markets generally. As a result of changing economic conditions, the Company may be limited in its ability to obtain additional financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all and there can be no assurances as to when financing conditions will improve.\nThe Company does not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt it may incur and its board of directors may change its leverage policy without stockholder consent, which could result in a different risk profile.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s charter and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness the Company can incur, the Company\u2019s policy is to employ prudent amounts of leverage and use debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of its assets and the diversification of its portfolio. The amount of leverage the Company will deploy for particular investments will depend upon its management team\u2019s assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of the assets in its portfolio, the potential for losses, the availability and cost of financing the assets, the Company\u2019s opinion of the creditworthiness of its financing counterparties, the health of the U.S. economy and commercial mortgage markets, the Company\u2019s outlook for the level, slope and volatility of interest rates, the credit quality of the tenants occupying space at the Company\u2019s properties, and the need for the Company to comply with financial covenants contained in the Company\u2019s credit agreements. The Company\u2019s board of directors may change its leverage policies at any time without the consent of its stockholders, which could result in an investment portfolio with a different risk profile.\nThe Company could be adversely affected if it or any of its subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d).\nThe Company conducts its operations so that neither it, nor the Operating Partnership nor any of the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries, is required to register as investment companies under the 1940 Act. If the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company but fail to do so, the unregistered entity would be prohibited from engaging in certain business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against such entity. In addition, the contracts of such entity would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of the entity and liquidate its business.\nReal estate investments\u2019 value and income fluctuate due to conditions in the general economy and the real estate business, which may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to service its debt and expenses.\nThe value of real estate fluctuates depending on conditions in the general and local economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also limit the Company\u2019s revenues and available cash. The rents the Company receives and the occupancy levels at its properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. If rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, the Company generally would expect to have less cash available to pay indebtedness and for distribution to its stockholders. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally do not decline when the related rents decline.\nThe lack of liquidity of the Company\u2019s assets could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders, and could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to value and sell its assets.\nReal estate investments are relatively difficult to buy and sell quickly. As a result, the Company expects many of its investments will be illiquid and if it is required to liquidate all or a portion of its portfolio quickly, it may realize significantly less than the value at which it had previously recorded its investments.\nThe Company depends on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants, some of whom may not be able to pay.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results depend significantly on leasing space in its properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition, as a substantial majority of the Company\u2019s revenue comes from renting real property, the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders could be materially and adversely affected if a significant number of its tenants cannot pay their rent or if the Company is not able to maintain occupancy levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, the Company may not be able to enforce its rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs.\nSome of the Company\u2019s properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these tenants.\nThe Company\u2019s shopping centers are primarily anchored by national and regional supermarkets and drug stores. The value of the retail properties the Company acquires could be materially and adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations. Adverse economic conditions may result in the closure of existing stores by tenants which may result in increased vacancies at the Company\u2019s properties. Any periods of significant vacancies for the Company\u2019s properties could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nLoss of revenues from major tenants could reduce the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nThe Company derives significant revenues from anchor tenants such as Albertsons / Safeway Supermarkets, Kroger Supermarkets and Rite Aid Pharmacy. As of December 31, 2021, these tenants are the Company\u2019s three largest tenants and accounted for 5.5%, 3.4% and 1.5%, respectively, of its annualized base rent on a pro-rata basis. The Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of revenues in the event a major tenant becomes bankrupt or insolvent, experiences a downturn in its business, materially defaults on its leases, does not renew its leases as they expire, or renews at lower rental rates.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to receive reimbursements of Common Area Maintenance (\u201cCAM\u201d) costs from tenants could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow.\nCAM costs typically include allocable energy costs, repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to common areas, janitorial services, administrative, property and liability insurance costs and security costs. The Company may acquire properties with leases with variable CAM provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases or leases with a fixed CAM payment methodology which fixes its tenants\u2019 CAM contributions. With respect to both variable and fixed payment methodologies, the amount of reimbursements for CAM costs that the Company is entitled to receive from its tenants pursuant to the terms of the respective lease agreements may be less than the actual CAM costs at the Company\u2019s properties. The Company\u2019s inability to recover or pass on CAM costs to its tenants, whether due to the terms of the Company\u2019s leases or vacancies at the Company\u2019s properties, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow.\nThe Company may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair the Company\u2019s ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing\npolychlorinated biphenyls (\u201cPCBs\u201d) and underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws. The Company is also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. The Company could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or tanks or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from its properties. Identification of compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, discovery of additional sites, human exposure to the contamination or changes in cleanup or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to the Company. Moreover, compliance with new laws or regulations such as those related to climate change, including compliance with \u201cgreen\u201d building codes, or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws may require material expenditures by the Company.\nThe Company faces risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of its information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) networks and related systems.\nThe Company faces risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside the Company or persons with access to systems inside the Company, and other significant disruptions of the Company\u2019s IT networks and related systems, including due to defects in design, equipment or system failures, human error and natural disasters. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. The Company\u2019s IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of its business and its ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing its building systems). There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. A security breach or other significant disruption involving the Company\u2019s IT networks and related systems could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nThese risks require continuous and likely increasing attention and other resources from the Company to, among other actions, identify and quantify these risks, upgrade and expand the Company\u2019s technologies, systems and processes to adequately address them and provide periodic training for the Company\u2019s employees to assist them in detecting phishing, malware and other schemes. Such attention diverts time and other resources from other activities and there is no assurance that the Company\u2019s efforts will be effective. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of the Company\u2019s business. The Company can provide no assurance that the networks and systems that the Company\u2019s third-party vendors have established or use will be effective. As the Company\u2019s reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to the Company\u2019s information systems, both internal and those provided by the Company and third-party service providers.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and its service providers collect and retain certain personal information provided by employees, tenants and vendors. The Company also relies extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage its business. The Company can provide no assurance that the data security measures designed to protect confidential information on the Company\u2019s systems established by the Company and the Company\u2019s service providers will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this personal information or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the Company\u2019s internal information technology systems, its systems are vulnerable to damage from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in the Company\u2019s operations could result in a material disruption to its business. The Company may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.\nA prolonged economic slowdown, a lengthy or severe recession or declining real estate values could impair the Company\u2019s assets and have a material and adverse effect on its income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nThe Company believes the risks associated with its business will be more severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession if these periods are accompanied by declining real estate values. Declines in real estate values, among other factors, could result in a determination that the Company\u2019s assets have been impaired. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, the Company would be required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the impairment charge is recorded. Although the Company will take current economic conditions into account in acquiring its assets, the Company\u2019s long-term success, and the value of its assets, depends in part on general economic conditions and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the national economy or the local economies in which the Company operates experience uncertainty, or if general economic conditions were to worsen, the value of the Company\u2019s properties could decline, and the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders, could be materially and adversely affected.\nLoss of key personnel could harm the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company is dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel of its senior management team. While the Company has employment contracts with each of Messrs. Tanz, Haines and Schoebel, the loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm the Company\u2019s operations and have a material and adverse effect on its income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nUnder their employment agreements, certain members of the Company\u2019s senior management team will have certain rights to terminate their employment and receive severance in connection with a change in control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s employment agreements with each of Messrs. Tanz, Haines and Schoebel, which provide that, upon termination of his employment (i) by the applicable officer within 12 months following the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the employment agreement), (ii) by the Company without cause (as defined in the employment agreement), (iii) by the applicable officer for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement), (iv) by non-renewal of the applicable officer\u2019s employment agreement or (v) by reason of the applicable officer\u2019s death or disability (as defined in the employment agreement), such executive officers would be entitled to certain termination or severance payments made by the Company (which may include a lump sum payment equal to defined percentages of annual salary and prior years\u2019 average bonuses, paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective agreement). In addition, the vesting of all his outstanding unvested equity-based incentives and awards would accelerate. These provisions make it costly to terminate their employment and could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of the Company that might involve a premium paid for shares of its common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders.\nJoint venture investments could be materially and adversely affected by the Company\u2019s lack of sole decision-making authority or reliance on a joint venture partner\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company may enter into joint venture arrangements in the future. Investments in joint ventures involve risks that are not otherwise present with properties which the Company owns entirely. In a joint venture investment, the Company may not have exclusive control or sole decision-making authority over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. As a result, the joint venture partner might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the Company\u2019s goals or interests, take action contrary to the Company\u2019s interests or otherwise impede the Company\u2019s objectives. Joint venture investments involve risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the joint venture partner failing to provide capital and fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to the Company for guarantees and other commitments, the risk of conflicts arising between the Company and its partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. The joint venture partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to the Company. Further, although the Company may own a controlling interest in a joint venture and may have authority over major decisions such as the sale or refinancing of investment properties, the Company may have fiduciary duties to the joint venture partners or the joint venture itself that may cause, or require, it to take or refrain from taking actions that it would otherwise take if it owned the investment properties outright. In addition, in the case of mixed-use redevelopment with a joint venture partner, the Company might be\nexposed to risks associated with developing, owning, operating or selling non-retail real estate, with which the Company has less experience than with the risks associated with retail real estate.\nUninsured losses or a loss in excess of insured limits could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company carries comprehensive general liability, fire, extended coverage, loss of rent insurance, and environmental liability where applicable on its properties, with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. There are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars or acts of God that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, the Company could lose capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property, while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness, or other financial obligations or liabilities related to the property. Any loss of these types could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects and ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nThe Company could be materially and adversely affected by poor market conditions where its properties are geographically concentrated.\nThe Company\u2019s performance depends on the economic conditions in markets in which its properties are concentrated. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s properties in California, Washington and Oregon accounted for 67%, 20% and 13%, respectively, of its consolidated property operating income. The Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders could be materially and adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area, deteriorate in California, Washington and Oregon. Moreover, due to the geographic concentration of its properties, the Company may be disproportionately affected by general risks such as natural disasters, including major fires, floods and earthquakes, severe or inclement weather, and acts of terrorism should such developments occur in or near the markets in California, Washington and Oregon in which the Company\u2019s properties are located.\nShould the Company decide at some point in the future to expand into new markets, it may not be successful, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s properties are concentrated in California, Washington and Oregon. If the opportunity arises, the Company may explore acquisitions of properties in new markets inside or outside of these states. Each of the risks applicable to the Company\u2019s ability to successfully acquire, integrate and operate properties in its current markets may also apply to its ability to successfully acquire, integrate and operate properties in new markets. In addition to these risks, the Company\u2019s management team may not possess the same level of knowledge with respect to market dynamics and conditions of any new market in which the Company may attempt to expand, which could materially and adversely affect its ability to operate in any such markets. The Company may be unable to obtain the desired returns on its investments in these new markets, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects and ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nRisks Related to Financing\nThe Company\u2019s term loan, credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain restrictive covenants relating to its operations, which could limit the Company\u2019s ability to respond to changing market conditions and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s term loan, credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain restrictive covenants. These or other limitations, including those that may apply to future Company borrowings, may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility and its ability to achieve its operating plans and could result in the Company being limited in the amount of dividends and distributions it would be permitted to pay to its stockholders.\nIn addition, failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt instrument, and the Company may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to the Company, or may be available only on unattractive terms.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s mortgage financing arrangements and other indebtedness contain provisions that could limit the Company\u2019s operating flexibility.\nThe Company\u2019s existing mortgage financing contains, and future mortgage financing may in the future contain, customary covenants and provisions that limit the Company\u2019s ability to pre-pay such mortgages before their scheduled maturity date or to transfer the underlying asset. Additionally, the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy prospective mortgage lenders\u2019 insurance requirements may be materially and adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against certain risks than is available to the Company in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, because a mortgage is secured by a lien on the underlying real property, mortgage defaults subject the Company to the risk of losing the property through foreclosure.\nThe Company\u2019s access to financing may be limited and thus its ability to potentially enhance its returns may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company intends, when appropriate, to employ prudent amounts of leverage and use debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of its assets and the diversification of its portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s outstanding principal mortgage indebtedness was approximately $84.9 million, and the Company may incur significant additional debt to finance future acquisition and development activities. The Company has a $300.0 million term loan, of which $300.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Further, the credit facility consists of a $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, of which no funds were outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\nIn addition, the Operating Partnership issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2017 (the \u201cSenior Notes Due 2027\u201d), $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in September 2016 (the \u201cSenior Notes Due 2026\u201d), $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2014 (the \u201cSenior Notes Due 2024\u201d) and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in December 2013 (the \u201cSenior Notes Due 2023\u201d and collectively with the Senior Notes Due 2024, the Senior Notes Due 2026 and the Senior Notes Due 2027, the \u201cunsecured senior notes\u201d), each of which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by ROIC.\nThe Company\u2019s access to financing will depend upon a number of factors, over which it has little or no control, including:\n\u2022general market conditions;\n\u2022the market\u2019s view of the quality of the Company\u2019s assets;\n\u2022the market\u2019s perception of the Company\u2019s growth potential;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s eligibility to participate in and access capital from programs established by the U.S. government;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and\n\u2022the market price of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAny reduction in available financing may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its financial objectives. Concern about the stability of the markets generally could adversely affect one or more private lenders and could cause one or more private lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide the Company with financing or to increase the costs of that financing. In addition, if regulatory capital requirements imposed on the Company\u2019s private lenders change, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to the Company. In general, this could potentially increase the Company\u2019s financing costs and reduce its liquidity or require it to sell assets at an inopportune time or price.\nDuring times when interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on a timely basis, the Company may purchase certain properties for cash or equity securities, including OP Units, or a combination thereof. Consequently, depending on market conditions at the relevant time, the Company may have to rely more heavily on additional equity issuances, which may be dilutive to its stockholders, or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of its cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for its operations, future business opportunities, cash distributions to its stockholders and other purposes. The Company cannot assure you that it will have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms (including, without limitation, cost and term) at the desired times, or at all, which may cause it to curtail its asset acquisition activities and/or dispose of assets, which could materially and adversely affect its income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nIncreases in interest rates could increase the amount of the Company\u2019s debt payments and materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nInterest the Company pays could reduce cash available for distributions. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Company\u2019s $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and $300.0 million outstanding under its $300.0 million term loan, that bear interest at a variable rate. In addition, the Company may incur variable rate debt in the future, including mortgage debt, borrowings under the credit facility or new credit facilities. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors has announced its intention to determine what future adjustments are appropriate to the federal funds rate over time, including as a result of increased concerns over inflation, but such changes in fiscal and monetary policies are beyond the Company\u2019s control and are difficult to predict. An increase in interest rates would increase the Company\u2019s interest costs, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow, results of operations, ability to pay principal and interest on debt and pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders, and reduce the Company\u2019s access to capital markets. In addition, if the Company needs to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, it may be required to incur additional indebtedness at higher rates. From time to time, the Company may enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts with the intention of lessening the impact of rising interest rates. However, increased interest rates may increase the risk that the counterparties to such agreements may not be able to fulfill their obligations under these agreements, and there can be no assurance that these arrangements will be effective in reducing the Company\u2019s exposure to interest rate changes. These risks could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders. The Company\u2019s use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose the Company to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that the Company could be required to fund the Company\u2019s contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate the Company from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe replacement of LIBOR may affect the value of certain of the Company\u2019s financial obligations and could affect the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nAs announced on March 5, 2021 by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\u201cIBA\u201d) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the IBA will cease publishing the overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month settings of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates immediately after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARCC\u201d), which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended risk-free alternative rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding approximately $300.0 million of variable rate debt that was indexed LIBOR. There can be no assurance that the benchmark replacement rate plus any spread adjustment will be economically equivalent to U.S. dollar LIBOR. In addition, market practices related to calculation conventions for replacement benchmark rates continue to develop and may vary, and inconsistent conventions may develop among financial products. Inconsistent use of replacement rates or calculation conventions among financial products could expose the Company to additional financial risks and increase the cost of any related hedging transactions. It is not possible to predict all consequences of the IBA\u2019s plans to cease publishing LIBOR, any related regulatory actions and the expected discontinuance of the use of LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts. There is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates will not result in financial market disruptions or significant increases in the Company\u2019s borrowing costs or the costs of any related hedging, any of which could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of its common stock.\nFinancing arrangements that the Company may use to finance its assets may require it to provide additional collateral or pay down debt.\nThe Company, when appropriate, uses traditional forms of financing including secured debt. In the event the Company utilizes such financing arrangements, they would involve the risk that the market value of its assets which are secured may decline in value, in which case the lender may, in connection with a refinancing, require it to provide additional collateral, provide additional equity, or to repay all or a portion of the funds advanced. The Company may not have the funds available to repay its debt or provide additional equity at that time, which would likely result in defaults unless it is able to raise the funds from alternative sources, which it may not be able to achieve on favorable terms or at all. Providing additional collateral or equity would reduce the Company\u2019s liquidity and limit its ability to leverage its assets. If the Company cannot meet these requirements, the lender could accelerate the Company\u2019s indebtedness, increase the interest rate on advanced funds and terminate its ability to borrow funds from them, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s income, cash flow,\nresults of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders. The providers of secured debt may also require the Company to maintain a certain amount of cash or set aside assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position. As a result, the Company may not be able to leverage its assets as fully as it would choose which could reduce its return on assets. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to utilize such arrangements on favorable terms, or at all.\nA downgrade in the Company\u2019s or the Operating Partnership\u2019s credit ratings could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nThe credit ratings assigned to the Company\u2019s obligations or to the debt securities of the Operating Partnership could change based upon, among other things, the Company\u2019s and the Operating Partnership\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that any rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, these credit ratings do not apply to the Company\u2019s common stock and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any other securities. If any of the credit rating agencies that have rated the obligations of the Company or the debt securities of the Operating Partnership downgrades or lowers its credit ratings, or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has placed any such rating on a so-called \u201cwatch list\u201d for a possible downgrading or lowering or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s costs and availability of capital, which could in turn materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to its stockholders.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Organization and Structure\nThe Company depends on dividends and distributions from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to the Company.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s assets are held through the Operating Partnership, which holds substantially all of the Company\u2019s properties and assets through subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership\u2019s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries, and in turn, substantially all of the Company\u2019s cash flow is dependent on cash distributions to it by the Operating Partnership. The creditors of the Company\u2019s direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary\u2019s obligations to them, when due and payable, before distributions may be made by that subsidiary to its common equity holders. Thus, the Operating Partnership\u2019s ability to make distributions to the Company and therefore the Company\u2019s ability to make distributions to its stockholders will depend on its subsidiaries\u2019 ability first to satisfy their obligations to creditors and then to make distributions to the Operating Partnership.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s participation in any distribution of the assets of any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency, is only after the claims of the creditors, including the holders of the unsecured senior notes and trade creditors are satisfied.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of the Company.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of the Company that might involve a premium price for holders of the Company\u2019s common stock or otherwise be in their best interests, including:\n\u2022\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to certain limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between the Company and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the Company\u2019s shares or an affiliate thereof) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose special minimum price provisions and special stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and\n\u2022\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of the Company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nHowever, the provisions of the MGCL relating to business combinations do not apply to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the Company\u2019s board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. In addition, the Company\u2019s bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. There can be no assurance that such exemption will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.\nAdditionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits the Company\u2019s board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in the Company\u2019s charter or bylaws, to take certain actions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of the Company that might involve a premium to the market price of its common stock or otherwise be in the stockholders\u2019 best interests. These provisions of the MGCL permit the Company, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to adopt:\n\u2022a classified board;\n\u2022a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director;\n\u2022a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the board of directors;\n\u2022a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors in office and (if the board is classified) for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred; and\n\u2022a majority requirement for the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders.\nThe authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and the ownership limitations contained in the Company\u2019s Charter may prevent a change in control.\nThe Company\u2019s charter authorizes the Company to issue authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. In addition, the Company\u2019s charter provides that the Company\u2019s board of directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to authorize the Company to issue any authorized but unissued shares of stock, to classify any unissued shares of preferred stock and to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or previously-classified shares of preferred stock into other classes or series of stock. As a result, the Company\u2019s board of directors may establish a series of shares of preferred stock or use such preferred stock to create a stockholder\u2019s rights plan or so-called \u201cpoison pill\u201d that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s charter contains restrictions limiting the ownership and transfer of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and other outstanding shares of capital stock. The relevant sections of the Company\u2019s charter provide that, subject to certain exceptions, ownership of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock by any person is limited to 9.8% by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of common stock (the common share ownership limit), and no more than 9.8% by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding capital stock (the aggregate share ownership limit). The common share ownership limit and the aggregate share ownership limit are collectively referred to herein as the \u201cownership limits.\u201d These provisions will restrict the ability of persons to purchase shares in excess of the relevant ownership limits. The Company\u2019s board of directors has established exemptions from this ownership limit which permit certain institutional investors to hold additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company\u2019s board of directors may in the future, in its sole discretion, establish additional exemptions from this ownership limit.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT would subject it to U.S. federal income tax and potentially increased state and local taxes, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to its stockholders.\nThe Company intends to operate in a manner that will enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company has not requested and does not intend to request a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service that it will continue to qualify as a REIT. The U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs are complex. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable U.S. Treasury Department regulations that have been promulgated under the Code (\u201cTreasury Regulations\u201d) is greater in the case of a REIT that holds assets through a partnership, such as the Company, and judicial and administrative interpretations of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REIT qualification are limited. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet, on an ongoing basis, various tests regarding the nature of its assets and its income, the ownership of its outstanding shares, and the amount of its distributions. Moreover, new legislation, court decisions or\nadministrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to qualify as a REIT. Thus, while the Company believes that it has operated and intends to continue to operate so that it will qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in the Company\u2019s circumstances, no assurance can be given that it has qualified or will continue to so qualify for any particular year.\nIf the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and does not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, it would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income, and distributions to its stockholders would not be deductible by it in determining its taxable income. In such a case, the Company might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay its taxes. The Company\u2019s payment of income tax would decrease the amount of its income available for distribution to its stockholders. Furthermore, if the Company fails to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it would no longer be required to distribute substantially all of its net taxable income to its stockholders. In addition, unless the Company were eligible for certain statutory relief provisions, it would not be eligible to re-elect to qualify as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which it failed to qualify as a REIT.\nFailure to make required distributions would subject the Company to tax, which would reduce the cash available for distribution to its stockholders.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, the Company must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. To the extent that the Company satisfies the 90% distribution requirement, but distributes less than 100% of its taxable income, it is subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its undistributed income. In addition, the Company will incur a 4% non-deductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which its distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. The Company intends to distribute its net income to its stockholders in a manner intended to satisfy the REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid the 4% non-deductible excise tax.\nThe Company\u2019s taxable income may exceed its net income as determined by the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) because, for example, realized capital losses will be deducted in determining its GAAP net income, but may not be deductible in computing its taxable income. In addition, the Company may invest in assets that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets. For example, the Company may be required to accrue interest or other income on debt securities before it receives payments on such assets, and under certain circumstances the Company could also be required to accrue income on leases in advance of receiving cash payments under the terms of such leases. As a result of the foregoing, the Company may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year. To the extent that the Company generates such non-cash taxable income in a taxable year, it may incur corporate income tax and the 4% non-deductible excise tax on that income if it does not distribute such income to stockholders in that year. In that event, the Company may be required to use cash reserves, incur debt or liquidate assets at rates or times that it regards as unfavorable or make a taxable distribution of its shares in order to satisfy the REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid U.S. federal corporate income tax and the 4% non-deductible excise tax in that year.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, prior to the end of each taxable year, the Company is required to distribute any earnings and profits of any corporation acquired by the Company in certain tax-deferred transactions to the extent that such earnings accrued at a time when such corporation did not qualify as a REIT. The Company has entered into certain transactions involving the tax-deferred acquisition of target corporations. The Company believes that it did not inherit any earnings and profits of such target corporations attributable to any period that such corporations did not qualify as a REIT. However, no assurance can be provided in this regard, and if the Company were determined to have inherited and retained any such earnings and profits, the Company\u2019s qualification as a REIT could be adversely impacted.\nTo maintain its REIT qualification, the Company may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, the Company may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis, or possibly on a long-term basis, to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from, among other things, a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment regarding cash settlement of a forward sale agreement is unclear and could jeopardize the Company\u2019s ability to meet the REIT qualification requirements.\nIn the event that the Company elects to settle any forward sale agreement with respect to the Company\u2019s at-the-market offering described above under \u201cBusiness-Financing Activities-ATM Equity Offering\u201d for cash and the settlement price is different than the applicable forward sale price, the Company will either receive a cash payment from or make a cash payment to the relevant Forward Purchaser. Under Section 1032 of the Code, generally, no gain or loss is recognized by a corporation in dealing in its own stock, including pursuant to a \u201csecurities futures contract.\u201d Although the Company believes that any amount received by the Company in exchange for its common stock would qualify for the exemption under Section 1032 of the Code, it is unclear whether a cash settlement of such forward sale agreement would also qualify for such exemption. In the event that the Company recognizes a significant gain from the cash settlement of a forward sale agreement, the Company might not be able to satisfy the gross income requirements applicable to REITs under the Code. In the event that the Company is required to make a significant payment in cash to settle a forward sale agreement, the Company might not be able to satisfy the distribution requirements applicable to REITs under the Code, absent additional debt or equity financing. While the Company would not anticipate electing the cash settlement option under any forward sale agreement, such a cash settlement election could result in the Company\u2019s failure to satisfy the REIT income tests or distribution requirements. In that case, the Company may be able to rely upon the relief provisions under the Code in order to avoid the loss of the Company\u2019s REIT status. In the event that these relief provisions were not available, the Company could lose its REIT status under the Code.\nEven if the Company qualifies as a REIT, it may be required to pay certain taxes.\nEven if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on its income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, taxes on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure and state or local income, franchise, property and transfer taxes, including mortgage recording taxes. In addition, the Company may hold some of its assets through taxable REIT subsidiary (\u201cTRS\u201d) corporations. Any TRSs or other taxable corporations in which the Company owns an interest will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate taxes. Furthermore, the Company has entered into certain transactions in which the Company has acquired target entities in tax-deferred transactions. To the extent that such entities had outstanding U.S. federal income tax or other tax liabilities, the Company would succeed to such liabilities. Payment of these taxes generally would decrease the cash available for distribution to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nLegislative, regulatory or administrative changes could adversely affect the Company.\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations governing REITs and their stockholders, as well as the administrative interpretations of those laws and regulations, are constantly under review and may be changed at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given as to whether, when, or in what form, the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to the Company and its stockholders may be enacted. Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations of U.S. federal tax laws could adversely affect an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn certain circumstances, the Company may be liable for certain tax obligations of certain limited partners.\nIn certain circumstances, the Company may be liable for certain tax obligations of certain limited partners. The Company has entered into tax protection agreements under which it has agreed to minimize the tax consequences to certain limited partners resulting from the sale or other disposition of certain of the Company\u2019s assets. The obligation to indemnify such limited partners against adverse tax consequences is expected to continue until 2027. The Company may enter into additional tax protection agreements in the future, which could extend the period of time during which the Company may be liable for tax obligations of certain limited partners. During the period of these obligations, the Company\u2019s flexibility to dispose of the related assets will be limited. In addition, the amount of any indemnification obligations may be significant.\nThe Company cannot provide assurance of its ability to pay distributions in the future.\nThe Company intends to pay quarterly distributions and to make distributions to its stockholders in an amount such that it distributes all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income in each year, subject to certain adjustments. The Company\u2019s ability to pay distributions may be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, including the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All distributions will be made, subject to Maryland law (or Delaware law, in the case of distributions by the Operating Partnership), at the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors and will depend on the Company\u2019s earnings, its financial condition, any debt covenants, maintenance of its REIT qualification and other factors as its board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. The Company believes that a change in any one of the following factors could materially and adversely affect its income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service its debt obligations, the market price of its common stock and its ability to pay distributions to its stockholders:\n\u2022the profitability of the assets acquired;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to make profitable acquisitions;\n\u2022unforeseen expenses that reduce the Company\u2019s cash flow;\n\u2022defaults in the Company\u2019s asset portfolio or decreases in the value of its portfolio; and\n\u2022the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates.\nThe Company cannot provide assurance that it will achieve results that will allow it to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions in the future. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s distributions may include a return of capital.\nThe Company is subject to certain state laws and exchange requirements relating to the composition of its board of directors, including recently enacted diversity and gender quotas.\nCalifornia has enacted laws requiring public companies headquartered in California to maintain minimum female representation and to maintain minimum representation from underrepresented communities on their boards of directors. In addition, the Nasdaq has enacted certain requirements concerning diversity on boards of directors. The Company is in compliance with all such requirements. However, there can be no assurance that the composition of the Company\u2019s board will not change in the future or that the Company will be able to recruit, attract and/or retain qualified members of the board and meet such requirements in the future, which may cause certain investors to divert their holdings in the Company\u2019s stock and expose it to penalties and/or reputational harm.", "PERMNO": 92343, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "ROIC"}
