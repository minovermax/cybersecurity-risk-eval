RISK FACTORS\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking information based on our current expectations. Because our actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make or that are made on our behalf, this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our actual future results, including, but not limited to, our capital resources, the progress and timing of our clinical programs, the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, risks associated with regulatory filings, risks associated with determinations made by regulatory agencies, the potential clinical benefits and market potential of our product candidates, commercial market estimates, future development efforts, patent protection, effects of healthcare reform, reliance on third parties, and other risks set forth below.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $72.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $139.2 million. We have focused primarily on our drug discovery efforts and developing our product candidates. We have initiated clinical development of our lead product candidate, larotrectinib and it could be many years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our convertible preferred stock, our initial public offering and our follow-on public offerings in November 2015, May 2016 and January 2017. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u00b7 continue development of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 seek to identify additional product candidates;\n\u00b7 enter into additional collaboration arrangements with regards to product discovery, acquire or in-license other products and technologies, or develop internal drug discovery capabilities;\n\u00b7 enter into collaboration arrangements for companion diagnostics for our cancer therapies;\n\u00b7 maintain and leverage our collaboration with Array;\n\u00b7 continue and initiate clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 seek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u00b7 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u00b7 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 hire additional personnel;\n\u00b7 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u00b7 incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize a product or products with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing clinical trials of our product candidates, successfully developing companion diagnostics, obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates and\nmanufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of Loxo Oncology and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our discovery and preclinical development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations and may require us to raise additional capital that may dilute your ownership interest. A decline in the value of Loxo Oncology could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe are a clinical development company. We were incorporated in May 2013 and commenced operations in the third quarter of 2013. We rely on our collaboration with Array and other third parties to provide discovery and preclinical development capability. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our Company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates and conducting product development activities for larotrectinib, which we have advanced into clinical trials, and other product candidates. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete any clinical trials, including large-scale, pivotal clinical trials, develop companion diagnostics, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third-party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Medicines, on average, take ten to fifteen years to be developed from the time they are discovered to the time they are available for treating patients. Consequently, any predictions about our future success or viability based on our short operating history to date may not be as accurate as if we had a longer operating history.\nIn addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition from a company with a research focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nWe will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be compelled to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in parallel with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our discovery and preclinical development collaborations to identify new clinical candidates and initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, diagnostics, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our discovery and preclinical development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that, based upon our current operating plan, our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations to mid-2019, including development of larotrectinib, as well as discovery and development activities into Phase 1 trials for two additional product candidates, with additional resources available for other discovery and clinical development activities. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the scope, progress, results and costs of compound discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we enter into additional collaboration arrangements with regard to product discovery or acquire or in-license products or technologies;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we enter into collaboration arrangements for companion diagnostics for our cancer therapies;\n\u00b7 our ability to establish additional discovery collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we develop or expand internal drug discovery and development capabilities;\n\u00b7 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the costs of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7 revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval; and\n\u00b7 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. In addition, public policy around drug pricing, in the U.S, and outside of the U.S., may affect the commercial success of our product candidates. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings. We do not have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.\nRisks Related to the Discovery and Development of Our Product Candidates\nOur discovery and preclinical development is focused on the development of targeted therapeutics for well-defined patient populations, which is a rapidly evolving area of science, and the approach we are taking to discover and develop drugs is relatively new and may never lead to marketable products.\nThe discovery and development of targeted therapeutics for well-defined patient populations is an emerging field, and the scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop product candidates are relatively new. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing product candidates based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. The patient populations for our product candidates are not completely defined but are substantially smaller than the general treated cancer population, and we will need to screen and identify these patients. Successful identification of patients is dependent on several factors, including achieving certainty as to how specific genetic alterations respond to our product candidates and developing companion diagnostics to identify such genetic alterations as appropriate. Furthermore, even if we are successful in identifying patients, we cannot be certain that the resulting patient populations will be large enough to allow us to successfully commercialize our products and achieve profitability. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities for our products are informed by work that is not definitive and future analyses may lead to estimates that are higher or lower than these estimates than those provided at any given time, with respect to addressable patient populations. Therefore, we do not know if our approach will be successful, and if our approach is unsuccessful, our business will suffer.\nWe are very early in our development efforts and are substantially dependent on our lead product candidate, larotrectinib. If we or our collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize larotrectinib or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe currently do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval. We have invested significant financial resources in identifying potential drug candidates and funding our collaboration agreement with Array to conduct preclinical studies.\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of larotrectinib, for which we have initiated Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical\ntrials in patients in advanced or metastatic solid tumors. As a result, our business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, larotrectinib.\nWe have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:\n\u00b7 execute larotrectinib development activities;\n\u00b7 obtain required regulatory approvals for the development and commercialization of larotrectinib;\n\u00b7 maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7 build and maintain robust sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with strategic partners;\n\u00b7 establish successful companion diagnostics collaborations;\n\u00b7 gain market acceptance for larotrectinib;\n\u00b7 develop and maintain any strategic relationships we elect to enter into, including our collaboration with Array; and\n\u00b7 manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to drug discovery, preclinical development, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and commercialization.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize larotrectinib, and our business will suffer.\nDifficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates. We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials for larotrectinib given that we do not know how many patients harbor the TRK alterations larotrectinib is designed to inhibit.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical studies of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical studies depends in part on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates, and we may experience delays in our clinical trials if we encounter difficulties in enrollment. The patient population for our product candidates is not completely defined, but is substantially smaller than other cancer indications, because we are often looking for the same type of genetic alterations across different tumor types and the number of patients with these alterations may be small. For example, with respect to larotrectinib, we do not know exactly how many patients will have the target larotrectinib is designed to inhibit. In addition, the adoption of genetic testing across large populations of patients with cancer will be required for us to identify patients appropriate for our trials that are restricted to genetically defined populations.\nThe number of patients suitable for trial enrollment and potential commercialization depends on a series of risks that are difficult to quantify based on available information: the true number of patients with advanced cancer and a TRK fusion, the number of these patients who are referred for comprehensive genomic profiling, the sensitivity of the chosen comprehensive genomic assay for detecting TRK fusions, the ability of healthcare providers to recognize the importance of the presence of a TRK fusion, patient interest in seeking out a TRK inhibitor, and patient interest in larotrectinib instead of a competing program. Nevertheless, the incidence of TRK fusion patients appears to be low in the more common tumor types. Our proprietary work suggests that there are approximately 1,500-5,000 eligible advanced cancer patients addressable each year in the United States. However, the work that informed this estimate is not definitive and future analyses may lead to estimates that are higher or lower than this estimate. In addition, the broad utilization of sensitive diagnostic tests in routine clinical practice capable of identifying TRK fusion patients is as important to successful commercialization as the actual number of addressable patients.\nIn addition to potentially small populations, the eligibility criteria of our clinical trials will further limit the pool of available study participants as we will require that patients have specific characteristics that we can measure and/or that their disease is either severe enough or not too advanced to include them in a study. Additionally, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. We also may not be able to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of patients to complete our clinical studies because of the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, the availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical trials, the proximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective patients, and the patient referral practices of\nphysicians. If patients are unwilling to participate in our studies for any reason, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting studies, and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these product candidates could be delayed or prevented. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates, including:\n\u00b7 unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects;\n\u00b7 failure of our companion diagnostics in identifying patients;\n\u00b7 modifications to protocols of our clinical trials resulting from FDA or institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) decisions; and\n\u00b7 ambiguous or negative interim results of our clinical trials, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have only commenced clinical development of our lead product candidate larotrectinib and the risk of failure for all of our product candidates is high. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Further, the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. For example, the interim data we have presented from our ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of larotrectinib, including secondary efficacy evaluations of a small number of patients, may not predict the final results of that clinical trial or the results of later-stage clinical trials, including our pediatric Phase 1/2 trial, Phase 2 basket trial, NCI-MATCH trial or other clinical trials we may conduct. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. It is difficult to accurately predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval.\nWe may experience delays in our clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on time, need to be redesigned or be completed on schedule, if at all. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not put any of our product candidates on clinical hold in the future. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated because costs are greater than we anticipate or for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\u00b7 delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 delays in reaching, or failure to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u00b7 inability, delay, or failure in identifying and maintaining a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical programs;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\u00b7 delay or failure in having subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u00b7 clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7 lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and other third parties;\n\u00b7 clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u00b7 the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 we may experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients whose tumors harbor the specific genetic alterations that our product candidates are designed to target;\n\u00b7 our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7 we may have difficulty partnering with experienced CROs that can screen for patients whose tumors harbor the applicable genetic alterations and run our clinical trials effectively;\n\u00b7 regulators or IRBs may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7 the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; or\n\u00b7 there may be changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u00b7 be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u00b7 obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u00b7 obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings that would reduce the potential market for our products or inhibit our ability to successfully commercialize our products;\n\u00b7 be subject to additional post-marketing restrictions and/or testing requirements; or\n\u00b7 have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in advancing the clinical development of our product candidates, including larotrectinib.\nIn order to execute on our strategy of advancing the clinical development of our product candidates, we have designed our existing Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of larotrectinib, and expect to design future trials, to include patients whose tumors harbor the applicable genetic alterations that we believe contribute to cancer. Our goal is to enroll patients who have the highest probability of responding to the drug, in order to show early evidence of clinical efficacy. If we are unable to include patients whose tumors harbor the applicable genetic alterations, or if our product fails to work as we expect, our ability to assess the therapeutic effect, seek participation in FDA expedited review and approval programs, including Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track Designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, or otherwise to seek to accelerate clinical development and regulatory timelines, could be compromised, resulting in longer development times, larger trials and a greater likelihood of not obtaining regulatory approval.\nWe plan to seek marketing approval of larotrectinib for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with NTRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments. However, in order to obtain marketing approval from FDA, we may need to study our product candidates, including larotrectinib, in clinical trials specific for a given tumor type and this may result in increased time and cost. Even if our product candidate demonstrates efficacy in a particular tumor type, we cannot guarantee that any product candidate, including larotrectinib, will behave similarly in all tumor types, and we may be required to obtain separate regulatory approvals for each tumor type we intend a product candidate to treat. If any of our clinical trials are unsuccessful, our business will suffer.\nIf serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some of our product candidates.\nIf our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects in preclinical or clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to interrupt, delay or abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Larotrectinib toxicology studies in rats and monkeys demonstrated reversible increases in liver enzymes, and this may occur in humans. Testing in animals may not uncover all expected side effects or side effects in humans may be more severe. The TRK receptor family targeted by larotrectinib plays an important role in the nervous system in general and the central nervous system (\u201cCNS\u201d) in particular. In animal models no adverse CNS effects were observed. However, no assurance can be given that larotrectinib will not cause unwanted, and potentially unacceptable, nervous system or CNS side effects in humans.\nAdditional or more severe side effects may be identified in our ongoing clinical trials or in future clinical studies. These or other drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Many compounds developed in the biopharmaceutical industry that initially showed promise in early-stage testing for treating cancer have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nInvestors should not place undue reliance on the results of preclinical experiments or our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial since they are not necessarily predictive of the results that will form the basis of our global regulatory approval packages, and larotrectinib may not receive regulatory approval.\nIn an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, larotrectinib has demonstrated encouraging preliminary safety and efficacy. As of the November 10, 2016 data cutoff, 59 patients with refractory solid tumors had been enrolled and treated with single agent larotrectinib, including eight patients with cancers harboring TRK fusions. Larotrectinib was well tolerated at doses that include and exceed the recommended Phase 2 dose of 100 mg BID. A maximum tolerated dose (\u201cMTD\u201d) had not been defined. The majority of adverse events reported by the investigators were mild to moderate. The most common adverse events, largely Grade 1 and 2, include fatigue (37 percent), dizziness (29 percent), anemia (25 percent) and dyspnea (25 percent). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in more than two patients included anemia, fatigue, increased liver enzymes, and dyspnea. No individual Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in more than three patients treated at 100mg BID or more than five patients in the entire study population. Three patients have withdrawn from the study due to adverse events. Seven patients with TRK fusion cancers were on study sufficiently long for an efficacy assessment, while an eighth TRK fusion patient had been recently enrolled and was not yet evaluated for response. Six of the seven efficacy evaluable patients achieved a confirmed partial response, as defined by standard RECIST v1.1 criteria. Durability of response was also encouraging, as all responders remained in response. However, investors should not place undue reliance on the results from completed preclinical studies or data from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial since they do not ensure that other clinical trial data will be comparable, in terms of safety, overall response rate (\u201cORR\u201d), durability of response (\u201cDOR\u201d), or other factors the FDA and other regulators will consider in determining whether to approve an NDA for larotrectinib.\nThe final dataset, upon which global regulatory decisions will be based, will differ from the datasets previously disclosed. Potential reasons for these differences include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 not all patients will demonstrate tumor regression, experience tumor regression that meets the measurement thresholds required under RECIST v1.1 for a partial response, or remain on study long enough for an initial or confirmatory response assessment;\n\u00b7 patients will discontinue larotrectinib treatment for a number of reasons, including an adverse event, tumor progression following a response, or a lack of tumor regression or clinical benefit and discontinuations will impact larotrectinib\u2019s reported duration of therapy and DOR;\n\u00b7 additional time and patient accrual provide new opportunities to capture new adverse events and further characterize the ORR and DOR;\n\u00b7 for a final calculation of ORR and DOR, patients in the larotrectinib clinical trials will require independent radiology reviews, pursuant to which a new set of radiologists, not affiliated with the trial investigators, apply RECIST v1.1 measurements and readings to the study patients\u2019 primary radiology images-we expect, as is generally the case, that the ORR and DOR calculated based on the readings of the trial sites will differ from the ORR and DOR calculated during the independent radiology review process;\n\u00b7 patient accrual beyond the disclosed data will include study subjects with additional tumor types harboring TRK fusions, pediatric patients, and subjects with varying prior therapies and thus, the inclusion of these subpopulations in the final dataset may alter the characterization of larotrectinib\u2019s overall safety, ORR and DOR; and\n\u00b7 the precise composition of the final dataset is subject to additional regulatory feedback, which is expected closer to the time of an NDA, or equivalent, and the advice may vary by regulatory authority.\nAs a result, the final efficacy and safety datasets for larotrectinib have not been fully populated or established, and are expected to differ from any interim dataset publicly disclosed. Moreover, regulatory approvals will be based on the final efficacy and safety databases, and as such, we can give no assurance that larotrectinib will receive regulatory approval.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we must focus on a limited number of research programs and product candidates and on specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future discovery and preclinical development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nFailure to successfully validate, develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostics for our product candidates could harm our drug development strategy and operational results.\nAs one of the central elements of our business strategy and clinical development approach, we often seek to identify subsets of patients with a genetic alteration who may derive meaningful benefit from our development product candidates. To achieve this, our product development programs can be dependent on the development and commercialization of a companion diagnostic by us or by third-party collaborators. Companion diagnostics are developed in conjunction with clinical programs for the associated product and are subject to regulation as medical devices. For example, for larotrectinib, we are working with collaborators to develop appropriate companion diagnostics to identify patients with tumors that harbor TRK fusions. The approval of a companion diagnostic as part of the product labeling may limit the use of the product candidate to only those patients who express the specific genetic alteration it was developed to detect. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners or negotiating insurance reimbursement plans, all of which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nCompanion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate clearance or approval prior to their commercialization. To date, the FDA has required premarket approval of all companion diagnostics for cancer therapies. We, and our third-party collaborators, may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. Any delay or failure by us or third-party collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic could delay or prevent approval of our related product candidates.\nFailure by us or our third-party collaborators to successfully commercialize companion diagnostics developed for use with our product candidates could harm our ability to commercialize these product candidates.\nEven if we or our companion diagnostic collaborators successfully obtain regulatory approval for the companion diagnostics for our product candidates, our collaborators:\n\u00b7 may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7 may not pursue commercialization of companion diagnostics for our therapeutic product candidates that achieve regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 may elect not to continue or renew commercialization programs based on changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u00b7 may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products; and\n\u00b7 may terminate their relationship with us.\nAdditionally, we, or our collaborators, may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostics, affect the ease of use, affect the price or have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostics in the clinical community.\nIf companion diagnostics for use with our product candidates fail to gain market acceptance, our ability to derive revenues from sales of our product candidates could be harmed. If insurance reimbursement to the laboratories who perform the companion diagnostic tests is inadequate, utilization may be low, and patient tumors may not be comprehensively screened for the presence of the genetic markers that predict response to our product candidates. If we or our collaborators fail to commercialize these companion diagnostics, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with our product candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to a new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States prior to commercialization. The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have little experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party CROs to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities, among other requirements. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective, may not have an acceptable durability of response, may not have an acceptable risk-benefit profile, or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. For example, development programs that span many tumor types are relatively novel, and to date, the FDA has not approved a therapy to treat multiple tumor types based on a basket trial. We cannot be sure that the FDA will accept our NDA for larotrectinib, including the basket trial design,for registration or that we will be able to obtain broad approval for larotrectinib across cancers with TRK fusions on the basis of the ongoing trials, if at all. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may also cause delays in or prevent the approval of an application.\nNew cancer drugs frequently are indicated only for patient populations that have not responded to an existing therapy or have relapsed. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying labeling may limit the approved use of our drug in this way, which could limit sales of the product.\nAny marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nThe FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation to larotrectinib for the treatment of infantile fibrosarcoma; however, an NDA for larotrectinib may not meet the eligibility criteria for a priority review voucher upon approval.\nThe FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation to larotrectinib for the treatment of infantile fibrosarcoma, a rare pediatric cancer under section 529(d) of the FDC Act. Designation of a drug as a drug for a rare pediatric disease does not guarantee that an NDA for such drug will meet the eligibility criteria for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher at the time the application is approved. Under the FDC Act, we will need to request a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher in our original NDA for larotrectinib. The FDA may determine that an NDA for larotrectinib does not meet the eligibility criteria for a priority review voucher upon approval, including for the following reasons:\n\u00b7 infantile fibrosarcoma no longer meets the definition of rare pediatric disease;\n\u00b7 the NDA contains an active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been previously approved in an NDA;\n\u00b7 the NDA is not deemed eligible for priority review;\n\u00b7 the NDA does not rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population and dosages of the drug intended for that population (i.e., if the NDA does not contain sufficient clinical data to allow for adequate labeling for use by the full range of affected pediatric patients); or\n\u00b7 the NDA seeks approval for a different adult indication than the rare pediatric disease (for example, if the FDA were to determine that the current larotrectinib breakthrough therapy designation indication that includes adult and pediatric patients is a different indication than the infantile fibrosarcoma indication).\nThe authority for the FDA to award rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers for drugs that have received rare pediatric disease designation prior to September 30, 2020 currently expires on September 30, 2022. If the NDA for larotrectinib is not approved prior to September 30, 2022 for any reason, regardless of whether it meets the criteria for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, it will not be eligible for a priority review voucher. However, it is also possible the authority for FDA to award rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers will be further extended through Federal lawmaking.\nWe may seek Orphan Drug Exclusivity for some of our product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Larotrectinib was designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma by the FDA and the EMA. There can be no assurance that any of our other product candidates will be designated as an orphan drug.\nGenerally, if a product with an Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during the period of exclusivity. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for Orphan Drug Designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan Drug Exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective, or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nIf we do obtain Orphan Drug Exclusivity of larotrectinib or another product candidate, such exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same orphan condition. In addition, after an orphan drug is approved and granted exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve a different drug containing the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. The FDA can also approve drugs containing the same active moiety for different indications.\nA Fast Track Designation by the FDA, even if granted for any of our product candidates, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nWe do not currently have Fast Track Designation for any of our product candidates but we may seek such designation, if we believe such a designation is warranted. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply to the FDA for Fast Track Designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation. Even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Many drugs that have received Fast Track Designation have failed to obtain drug approval.\nA Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nIn July 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to larotrectinib \u201cfor the treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with NTRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments.\u201d There can be no assurance that larotrectinib will be approved by the FDA with this indication or at all. There can be no assurance that any of our other product candidates will receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A Breakthrough Therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs that have received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor can help to identify the most efficient path for development.\nThe receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if our product candidates receive a Breakthrough Therapy Designation, the FDA may later decide that such product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we or our third-party collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and different criteria for approval. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We, or our third party collaborators, may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, failure to obtain approval in some countries or jurisdictions may compromise our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive post-approval regulatory requirements and could be subject to post-approval restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their testing, manufacture, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-approval information and reports, registration and listing requirements, current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, including periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authority, restrictions or requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping requirements.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials, diagnostic approval, and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding use of their products and if we promote our products beyond their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label promotion. Violations of the FDC Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u00b7 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u00b7 restrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u00b7 requirements to conduct post-approval studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 warning or untitled letters;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u00b7 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 recall of products;\n\u00b7 fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u00b7 product seizure; or\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNoncompliance with European Union requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union\u2019s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial\narrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u00b7 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7 the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7 federal law requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, which includes data collection and reporting obligations. The information was to be made publicly available on a searchable website in September 2014; and\n\u00b7 analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.\nSome state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (\u201cMMA\u201d) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and\npayment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively the \u201cPPACA\u201d) a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.\nAmong the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our potential product candidates are the following:\n\u00b7 an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;\n\u00b7 an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u00b7 expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u00b7 a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices;\n\u00b7 extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u00b7 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u00b7 new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;\n\u00b7 a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u00b7 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. In 2016, the U.S. Congress held hearings on the rising costs of prescription drugs, and there is increased media attention on the issue. Future legislation could potentially change drug pricing dynamics.\nWe expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues, if any.\nIn some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our discovery, preclinical development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nOur existing discovery collaboration with Array is important to our business. If we are unable to maintain this collaboration, or if this collaboration is not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nOn July 3, 2013, we entered into a Drug Discovery Collaboration Agreement with Array (\u201cthe Array Agreement\u201d) which was subsequently amended on November 26, 2013, April 10, 2014, October 13, 2014, March 31, 2015 and February 18, 2016. The statutory end of the Array Agreement is scheduled for September 30, 2017, with a one-year extension at our option. Pursuant to the Array Agreement, Array agreed to design, conduct and perform research and preclinical testing for certain compounds that we select, including larotrectinib, targeted at TRKA, TRKB and TRKC, and identify Investigational New Drug candidates for TRK and other targets, while undertaking manufacturing activities sufficient to conduct Phase 1 clinical trials for a subset of these programs. Array granted us exclusive licenses worldwide, for clinical and commercial development of these compounds. See \u201cBusiness-Array Collaboration.\u201d\nArray has an obligation to test targets during our discovery phase, but we cannot be certain that our collaboration will lead to the discovery of any additional product candidates beyond larotrectinib or that any of these product candidates will be successfully commercialized and developed. We and Array jointly own the intellectual property developed by the combined efforts of both our employees, and we each retain ownership of intellectual property that we develop independently pursuant to the collaboration. Array has granted us an exclusive license under all intellectual property for our product candidates.\nBecause we currently rely on Array for a substantial portion of our discovery and preclinical capabilities, including reliance on employees of Array whom we fund to conduct preclinical development of our product candidates pursuant to the Array Agreement, if Array delays or fails to perform its obligations under the Array Agreement, disagrees with our interpretation of the terms of the collaboration or our discovery plan or terminates the Array Agreement, our pipeline of product candidates would be adversely affected. In addition, we rely on Array\u2019s expertise in drug discovery and preclinical testing, and our results will suffer if the Array employees who conduct work on our behalf lack expertise in this area. In some cases, Array subcontracts and hires consultants to conduct work on our program. If these subcontractors or consultants fail to perform their obligations as agreed, our program could suffer. Array may also fail to properly maintain or defend the intellectual property we have licensed from them, or even infringe upon, our intellectual property rights, leading to the potential invalidation of our intellectual property or subjecting us to litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, in the event that Array commits a material breach of the Array Agreement, our only recourse is to terminate the collaboration. If we terminate our collaboration with Array, especially during our discovery phase, the development of our product candidates would be materially delayed or harmed. Furthermore, we are\ndependent on the success of Array\u2019s business. If Array continues to be unprofitable and if it is unsuccessful in retaining employees or obtaining future financing, we would need to identify a new collaboration partner for discovery and preclinical development. If we are unsuccessful or significantly delayed in identifying a new collaboration partner, or unable to reach an agreement with such a partner on commercially reasonable terms, development for our pipeline of products will suffer and our business would be materially harmed.\nFurthermore, if Array changes its strategic focus, or if external factors cause it to divert resources from our collaboration, or if it independently develops products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates using resources it acquires from our collaboration, our business and results of operations could suffer. For example, while Array has granted us a license for compounds designed to target at least two of the three known TRK kinases. Array has retained ownership and rights to development of compounds targeting only one TRK kinase. We were notified by Array regarding their efforts and use of third parties for the development and/or commercialization of compounds that selectively modulate TRKA for oncology indications. We have not elected to be the third-party partner for such efforts, as permitted under our collaboration agreement with Array. If Array or its partners were to develop such compounds in direct competition with our product candidates, our business could be adversely impacted.\nFuture discovery and preclinical development collaborations may be important to us. If we are unable to maintain these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nFor some of our product candidates, we may in the future determine to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development of products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for any collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential development schedule or reduce the scope of research activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake discovery or preclinical development activities at our own expense. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or continue to develop our product candidates and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nFuture collaborations we may enter into may involve the following risks:\n\u00b7 collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u00b7 changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, may divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u00b7 collaborators may delay discovery and preclinical development, provide insufficient funding for product development of targets selected by us, stop or abandon discovery and preclinical development for a product candidate, repeat or conduct new discovery and preclinical development for a product candidate;\n\u00b7 collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed than ours;\n\u00b7 product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the development of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the discovery, preclinical development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u00b7 collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or intellectual property rights licensed to us or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u00b7 collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u00b7 collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nAdditionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development of any of our product candidates. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and the perception of our company by the business and financial communities could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain our collaborations, development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop them. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this filing also apply to the activities of our collaborators.\nWe expect to rely on third-party contractors and organizations to conduct our clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe will rely on third-party clinical research contractors and organizations to conduct our ongoing clinical trials of larotrectinib, and we will rely on third-party contractors, clinical data management organizations, independent contractors, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials beyond our current trials, and for clinical trials for programs other than larotrectinib. These agreements may terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we needed to enter into alternative arrangements, our product development activities could be delayed.\nWe compete with many other companies, some of which may be our business competitors, for the resources of these third parties. Large pharmaceutical companies often have significantly more extensive agreements and relationships with such third-party providers, and such third-party providers may prioritize the requirements of such large pharmaceutical companies over ours. The third parties on whom we rely may terminate their engagements with us at any time, which may cause delay in the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If any such third party terminates its engagement with us or fails to perform as agreed, we may be required to enter into alternative arrangements, which would result in significant cost and delay to our product development program. Moreover, our agreements with such third parties generally do not provide assurances regarding employee turnover and availability, which may cause interruptions in the research on our product candidates by such third parties.\nOur reliance on these third parties to conduct our clinical trials will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices (\u201cGCPs\u201d) for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We are also required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nAdditionally, we expect to rely substantially on third-party data managers for our clinical trial data. There is no assurance that these third parties will not make errors in the design, management or retention of our data or data systems. There is no assurance that these third parties will pass FDA or other regulatory audits, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and expect to continue to do so for commercialization. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products at an acceptable cost and quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates, and we do not have any manufacturing personnel. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We rely, and expect\nto continue to rely, on third parties, including Array, for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. We will rely on third parties as well for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a source for bulk drug product. The formulation used in early studies is not a final formulation for commercialization. Additional, changes may be required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities on specifications and storage conditions. These may require additional studies, and may delay our clinical trials.\nWe expect to rely on third-party manufacturers or third-party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of any other product candidates for which our collaborators or we obtain marketing approval.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u00b7 reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u00b7 the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u00b7 the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n\u00b7 the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products. In addition, if, during a preapproval inspection or other inspection of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facility or facilities, FDA determines that the facility is not in compliance with cGMP, any of our marketing applications that lists such facility as a manufacturer may not be approved or approval may be delayed until the facility comes into compliance with cGMP and completes a successful reinspection by FDA\nOur product candidates and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nEven if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are well established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments to the exclusion of our product candidates. In addition, physicians, patients and third-party payors may prefer other novel products to ours. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the efficacy and safety and potential advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u00b7 the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u00b7 the strength of our marketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7 the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement, including patient cost-sharing programs such as copays and deductibles;\n\u00b7 our ability to develop or partner with third-party collaborators to develop companion diagnostics;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and\n\u00b7 any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales force. If we are unable to establish effective sales or marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell or market our product candidates, we may not be able to effectively sell or market our product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenues.\nWe currently do not have a marketing or sales team for the marketing, sales and distribution of any of our product candidates that are able to obtain regulatory approval. Patient identification is likely to be important in the commercial setting, much as it has been important in the clinical trial setting. Our proprietary work suggests that there are approximately 1,500-5,000 eligible advanced cancer patients addressable each year in the United States. However, the work that informed this estimate is not definitive and future analyses may lead to estimates that are higher or lower than this estimate. The utilization of sensitive diagnostic testing in routine clinical practice is likely an important variable in identifying all of the eligible patients that may truly exist. In order to commercialize any product candidates, we must build on a territory-by-territory basis marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. If our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we intend to establish an internal sales or marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates, which will be expensive and time consuming and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. Capable managers with commercial experience will need to be identified and successfully recruited to the company. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of any of our products that we obtain approval to market. With respect to the commercialization of all or certain of our product candidates, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing our product candidates. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nSpecifically, there are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, many companies are developing cancer therapeutics that work by inhibiting\nmultiple kinases that may directly compete with our lead product candidate and future product candidates. For larotrectinib, examples of such potential competitors include, Daiichi Sankyo and its subsidiary Plexxikon (PLX-7486), Tesaro (TSR-011), Ignyta (entrectinib), Novartis AG (dovitinib), Mirati (MGDC516), Ono Pharmaceutical (ONO-4474 and ONO-5390556), Chugai Pharmaceutical, a member of the Roche Group (CH7057288), Blueprint Medicines, and TP Therapeutics. For RET, competitors include Eisai (lenvatinib), Exelixis (cabozantinib), AstraZeneca (vandetanib), Ariad (ponatinib), Novartis (dovitinib), Roche (alectinib), Pfizer (sunitinib), Ignyta (RXDX-105), and Blueprint Medicines (BLU-667). For FGFR, competitors include J&J (JNJ- 42756493), Novartis (BGJ-398, dovitinib), AstraZeneca (AZD4547), Clovis Oncology (lucitinib), Chugai (CH5183284), Bayer (BAY 1163877, BAY 1179470), Lilly (LY2874455), Eisai (E7090), Taiho (TAS-120), BI (nintedanib), Ariad (ponatinib), FivePrime (FP-1039, FPA144), Incyte (INCB54828), ArQule (ARQ087), BioClinica (MFGR1877S) and Principia (PRN1371).\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or slow our regulatory approval. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nThe insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. In 2016, the U.S. Congress held hearings on the rising costs of prescription drugs, and there is increased media attention on the issue. Future legislation could potentially change drug pricing dynamics. Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. For example, a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the United States and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain European countries. Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the healthcare market.\nIn addition to CMS and private payors, professional organizations such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology can influence decisions about reimbursement for new medicines by determining standards for care. In addition, many private payors contract with commercial vendors who sell software that provide guidelines that attempt to limit utilization of, and therefore reimbursement for, certain products deemed to provide limited benefit to existing alternatives. Such organizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of our products.\nIf insurance reimbursement to the laboratories who purchase the companion diagnostic tests is inadequate, utilization may be low, and patient tumors may not be comprehensively screened for the presence of the genetic markers that predict response to our product candidates.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue;\n\u00b7 reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe currently hold $5 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $5 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our product candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products, including any companion diagnostic developed by us or a third-party collaborator. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates. Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications we exclusively licensed from Array as well as exclusive worldwide licenses for all therapeutic indications for new intellectual property developed in our Array\ncollaboration. This patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending patent applications covering compositions of matter and methods of use.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions, and under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in scope. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our discovery and preclinical development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, India and China do not allow patents for methods of treating the human body. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cU.S. PTO\u201d) developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. PTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nThe risks described elsewhere pertaining to our patents and other intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that we license, and any failure to obtain, maintain and enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness. In some cases, we may not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that we license, and our licensors may fail to take the steps that we believe are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain and enforce the licensed patents. Any inability on our part to protect adequately our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the U.S. PTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The U.S. PTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nBecause competition in our industry is intense, competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our issued patents, patents of our licensors or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We may also elect to enter into license agreements in order to settle patent infringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation, and any such license agreements may require us to pay royalties and other fees that could be significant. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third-party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. Although we believe that licenses to these patents are available from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, if we were not able to obtain a license, or were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. PTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing\nthe infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nPresently we have rights to intellectual property to develop our product candidates, including patents and patent applications we exclusively licensed from Array as well as exclusive worldwide licenses for all therapeutic indications for new intellectual property developed in our Array collaboration. Because our programs may involve additional product candidates that may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. Additionally, a companion diagnostic may require that we or a third-party collaborator developing the diagnostic acquire use or proprietary rights held by third parties. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nFor example, we may collaborate with U.S. and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our discovery and preclinical development work under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such right of first negotiation for intellectual property, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, however, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered\ninto with all relevant parties. Moreover, to the extent we enter into such agreements, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Growth and Macroeconomic Conditions\nWe currently have a limited number of employees, are highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer and our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are an early-stage clinical development company with a limited operating history and, as of December 31, 2016, had 29 full-time employees. We are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical and business development expertise of Joshua H. Bilenker, M.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the other principal members of our management, scientific and clinical team. Although we have entered into employment letter agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success as we scale. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our development or commercialization strategies. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our discovery and preclinical development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe expect to expand our development and regulatory capabilities and potentially implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs and, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. This is particularly true in Europe, which is undergoing a continued severe economic crisis. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, such as those of our CROs, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect proprietary or confidential information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security. If our systems are breached or suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may significantly suffer and we may be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions or potential liability. Security breaches could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations, including development of our product candidates, and divert attention of management and key information technology resources.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, will continue to have the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our executive officers and directors, combined with our stockholders who individually own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially owned shares representing approximately 71% of our capital stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership control may:\n\u00b7 delay, defer or prevent a change in control;\n\u00b7 entrench our management and the board of directors; or\n\u00b7 impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may desire.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our Company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our Company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7 establish a classified board of directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u00b7 allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u00b7 limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from our board of directors;\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u00b7 require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u00b7 limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7 authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u00b7 require the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock that would be entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to amend or repeal specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans or otherwise, could result in dilution to the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell additional common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors in a prior transaction may be materially diluted. Additionally, new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. Further, any future sales of our common stock by us or resale of our common stock by our existing stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were 536,442 shares of our common stock available for future grant under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, there were outstanding options to purchase up to 2,825,851 shares of our common stock. Any future grants of options, warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into our common stock, or the exercise or conversion of such shares, and any sales of such shares in the market, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the underlying companies. As a result of this volatility, the market price of our common stock may fall. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7 results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 events affecting our collaboration partners, including Array;\n\u00b7 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7 the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u00b7 the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in- license additional product candidates or products;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7 the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to an increased incidence of securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cthe JOBS Act\u201d) and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u00b7 being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure;\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7 not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u00b7 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation-related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less\nattractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.\nWe are evaluating these rules and regulations, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d) we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2016. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nTo achieve compliance with Section 404, we have been engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we have dedicated and will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. It is possible that we may have triggered an \u201cownership change\u201d limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which are outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 14871, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "LOXO"}
