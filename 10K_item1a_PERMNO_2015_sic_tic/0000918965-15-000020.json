These risks should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements\nor from our historical performance. Additionally, there are other risks that we may not describe, because we currently do not perceive them to be material or because they are presently unknown, which could impact us. If any of these risks develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any risk factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nIT Systems and the transition to a new Enterprise Resource Planning System - Our ability to manage our business and monitor results is highly dependent upon information and communication systems. A failure of these systems or a new ERP system could disrupt our business.\nWe are highly dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate our business, including our enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") systems. In order to continue support of our growth, we are making significant technological upgrades to our information systems. We have been in the process of developing and implementing a company-wide, single ERP software system and related processes to perform various functions and improve on the efficiency of our global business. This is a lengthy and expensive process that has and will continue to result in a diversion of resources from other operations.\nAny disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and/or implementation of the new ERP system, or in the performance of our legacy systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business and potentially our customers' ability to access our price and product availability information or place orders. Further, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if our information systems do not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the information systems of companies we acquire may not be sufficient to meet our standards or we may not be able to successfully convert them to provide acceptable information on a timely and cost-effective basis. Furthermore, we must attract and retain qualified people to operate our systems, expand and improve them, integrate new programs effectively with our existing programs, and convert to new systems efficiently when required. Any disruption to our business due to such issues, or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated, could have an adverse effect on our financial results and operations.\nOur customers rely increasingly on our electronic ordering and information systems as a source for product information, including availability and pricing. There can be no assurance that our systems will not fail or experience disruptions, and any significant failure or disruption of these systems could prevent us from making sales, ordering and delivering products and otherwise conducting our business. Many of our customers use our website to check real-time product availability, see their customized pricing and place orders. The Internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns. In addition, some websites have experienced security breakdowns. While our website has not experienced any material disruptions or security breakdowns, any disruptions or breaches in security or a breach that compromises sensitive information could harm our relationship with our vendors, customers and other business partners. Any material disruption of our website or the Internet in general could impair our order processing or prevent our vendors and customers from accessing information and cause us to lose business.\nAcquisitions - Our growth strategy includes potential acquisitions of companies that complement or expand our existing business. Acquisitions involve a number of risks and uncertainties.\nWe have and expect to continue to acquire companies that complement or expand our business in the United States or internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places a significant strain on our management, operations, technical performance, financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions, and there are no assurances that we will be able to manage it effectively. Our personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to effectively manage our future operations, especially as we employ personnel in multiple domestic and international locations. We may not be able to hire, train, retain and manage the personnel required to address our growth. Failure to effectively manage our growth opportunities could damage our reputation, limit our future growth, negatively affect our operating results, and harm our business.\nAcquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including the following: distraction of management's attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the acquisition; difficulty in the integration of acquired businesses, including new employees, business systems and technology; inability to adapt to challenges of new markets, including geographies, products and services, or to attract new sources of profitable\nbusiness from expansion of products or services; exposure to new regulations; and issues not discovered in our due diligence process, such as unknown liabilities, fraud, cultural or business environment issues or that may not have adequate internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Also, we may be unable to retain or replace key employees of our acquired companies. Our operations may be adversely impacted by an acquisition that is not suited for us, is improperly executed, or substantially increases our debt. In addition, adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could increase the purchase price paid, including earnout payments. Any of these factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. Moreover, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization of intangible assets, or impairment of goodwill. Acquisitions could also result in a dilutive impact to our earnings. No assurances can be given that we will be able to dispose of business units on favorable terms or without significant costs, nor can there be any assurance future acquisitions will not result in future impairment charges.\nInternational operations - Our international operations expose us to risks that are different from, or possibly greater than, the risks we are exposed to domestically.\nWe currently have facilities in twelve countries outside the United States and sell products in a number of others. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations. These operations are subject to a variety of risks that are in addition to the risks that we face domestically or are similar risks but with potentially greater exposure. These risks include:\n\u2022\nFluctuations of foreign currency, exchange controls and currency devaluations;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\nChanges in, or expiration of, various foreign incentives that provide economic benefits to us;\n\u2022\nChanges in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in staffing and managing operations in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nChanges in international trade laws, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, affecting our import and export activities, including export license requirements, restrictions on the export of certain technology, and tariff changes;\n\u2022\nChanges in the interpretation and enforcement of laws (in particular related to items such as duty and taxation);\n\u2022\nPotential political and economic instability and changes in governments;\n\u2022\nCompliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations and anti-corruption laws, including the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions for our business activities outside the United States, the violation of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of export privileges;\n\u2022\nTerrorist or military actions that result in destruction or seizure of our assets or suspension or disruption of our operations or those of our customers;\n\u2022\nNatural disasters, power shortages, telecommunication failures, water shortages, fires, medical epidemics or pandemics, and other manmade or natural disasters or business interruptions in a region or specific country;\n\u2022\nPotential regulatory changes, including foreign environmental restrictions; and\n\u2022\nDifferent general economic conditions.\nOur company conducts business in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Latin American countries, which exposes our business to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Significant volatility and fluctuations in the rates of exchange for the U.S. dollar against currencies such as the Brazilian real, euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Colombian peso, Chilean peso and other currencies may also negatively impact our customer pricing, operating results and acquisition purchase prices, including earnout payments. While we manage our short-term exposure to fluctuations in the value of currencies using various derivatives or other financial instruments, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful. Our ability to engage in such mitigation may decrease or become even more costly as a result of more volatile market conditions.\nExchange rate fluctuations may cause our international results to fluctuate significantly when translated into U.S. dollars. Developing economies, such as Brazil, could have sudden and drastic changes in foreign exchange rates compared to others. The uncertainty of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro and other European currencies to fluctuate. Currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products in impacted jurisdictions, and our vendors may change product pricing due to currency changes. Thus, the volatility in exchange rates can have tremendous impact on our customers' ability to purchase our products.\nThe value of our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries may fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These fluctuations may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when we initially invested. We are unable to predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business, financial position or operating results.\nThe potential criminal penalties for violations of export regulations and anti-corruption laws, particularly the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, data privacy laws and environmental laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, create heightened risks for our international operations. In the event that a governing regulatory body determined that we have violated applicable export regulations or anti-corruption laws, we could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs and/or our export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIn addition, in foreign markets we are more dependent upon third party providers of key services, such as third party freight forwarders and third party warehouses in Europe and Latin America. We also rely on third party legal advisors to provide guidance on trade compliance issues and information systems providers to provide services related to denied party screening. Adverse changes in any of these third party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As we expand our international operations, we expect these risks to increase.\nBrazilian and Latin America operations - We face special political, economic and regulatory risks by doing business in Brazil and other Latin American countries, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our April 2011 acquisition of all of the shares of CDC Brasil Distribuidora de Tecnologias Especiais LTDA (\"CDC' or \"ScanSource Brasil\") and our January 2015 acquisition of all of the shares of Intersmart Com\u00e9rcio Importa\u00e7\u00e3o Exporta\u00e7\u00e3o de Equipamentos Eletr\u00f4nicos, S.A., and its related entities (collectively \u201cNetwork1\u201d), we have substantial operations in Brazil and other Latin American countries and face risks related to these country's complex tax, labor, trade compliance and consumer protection laws and regulations. We may now have exposure to the complex tax structure in Brazil, where we have noted that several other companies have had issues with Brazilian tax authorities that have impacted earnings. Additionally, developing markets such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru have greater political volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, are more likely than developed economies to experience market, currency and interest rate fluctuations and may have higher inflation. In addition, doing business in these countries poses additional challenges such as finding qualified employees, underdeveloped infrastructure, and identifying and retaining qualified suppliers and service providers among other risks. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, in developing markets it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, competition in developing markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations. Our success in integrating our Brazilian and additional Latin American operations is critical to our growth strategy. If we cannot successfully increase our business in these countries, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWhile our operations expose us to general economic risks related to Latin America, we cannot assure you that favorable economic, political, and other business conditions will exist in the future. A general economic recession in the region or any volatility or uncertainty related to the conditions to do business in the region could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth strategies - If we fail to effectively manage and implement our organic growth strategies, we will experience a negative effect on our business and financial results.\nA significant component of our growth strategy has been to add new vendors and products, and we expect to be able to enter new product markets in the future. Expansion of our existing product markets and entry into new product markets divert the use of our resources and systems, require additional resources that might not be available (or available on acceptable terms), result in new or more intense competition, may require longer implementation times or greater start-up expenditures than anticipated, and may otherwise fail to achieve the desired results in a timely fashion, if at all. In addition, while we have been very successful in adding new vendors in the past, we already represent most of the significant vendors in our primary areas of focus, and there is regular consolidation among our vendors. As a result, there may be fewer expansion opportunities of this nature in the future. If we are unable to increase our sales and earnings by expanding our product offerings in a cost effective manner, then our revenues may not grow.\nOur ability to successfully manage our growth will require continued enhancement of our operational, managerial and financial resources and controls. Our failure to effectively manage our growth would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, our growth may increase our working capital requirements and as a result, we may require additional equity or debt financing. Such financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all.\nVendor relationships - Terminations of a distribution or services agreement or a significant change in supplier terms, authorizations, or lack of product availability, or conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins, revenues or the level of capital required to fund our operations.\nA significant percentage of our net sales relates to products sold to us by relatively few vendors. As a result of such concentration risk, terminations of supply or services agreements or a change in terms or conditions of sale from one or more of our vendors could negatively affect our operating margins, revenues or the level of capital required to fund our operations. Our vendors have the ability to make adverse changes in their sales terms and conditions, such as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us. We have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our vendors. In certain product categories, limited price protection or return rights offered by our vendors may have a bearing on the amount of product we may be willing to stock. Our inability to pass through to our reseller customers the impact of these changes, as well as our failure to develop systems to manage ongoing vendor programs, could cause us to record inventory write-downs or other losses and could have significant negative impact on our gross margins.\nWe receive purchase discounts and rebates from some vendors based on various factors, including goals for quantitative and qualitative sales or purchase volume and customer related metrics. Certain purchase discounts and rebates may affect gross margins. Many purchase discounts from vendors are based on percentage increases in sales of products. Our operating results could be negatively impacted if these rebates or discounts are reduced or eliminated or if our vendors significantly increase the complexity of their refund procedures and thus costs for us to receive such rebates.\nOur ability to obtain particular products or product lines in the required quantities and our ability to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success. Our manufacturers have experienced product supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain suppliers to supply certain products on a timely basis. As a result, we have experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, short-term shortages of specific products. We cannot provide any assurances that vendors will be able to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill all of our customer orders on a timely basis.\nIn addition, vendors who currently distribute their products through us, may decide to shift to or substantially increase their existing distribution with other distributors, their own dealer networks, or directly to resellers or end-users. Suppliers have, from time to time, made efforts to reduce the number of distributors with which they do business. This could result in more intense competition as distributors strive to secure distribution rights with these vendors, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our reputation, sales and profitability may suffer if vendors are not able to provide us with an adequate supply of products to fulfill our customer orders on a timely basis or if we cannot otherwise obtain particular products or a product lines.\nVendor consolidation may also lead to changes in the nature and terms of relationships with our vendors. The loss or deterioration of a major vendor relationship would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCustomer relationships - We operate in a highly competitive environment and good customer relations are critical to our success. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and expand our customer relationships or acquire new customers.\nMeeting our customers' needs quickly and fairly is critical to our business success. Our transactions with our customers are generally performed on a purchase order basis rather than under long term supply agreements. Our customers generally do not have an obligation to purchase from us. Therefore, our customers can readily choose to purchase from other distributors. From time to time, we experience shortages in availability of some products from vendors, and this impacts our customers' decisions regarding whether to make purchases from us. Anything that negatively impacts our customer relations also can negatively impact our operating results. Accordingly, our sales can vary as a result of fluctuations in pricing, product availability, purchasing patterns of end-users and general competitive and economic conditions.\nVendor consolidation - Vendor consolidation that could lead to changes in the nature and terms of relationships with our major vendors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant amount of our inventory purchases are made from a limited number of vendors. Our reliance on these vendors leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of required products, price increases, late deliveries, and poor product quality. Like other distributors in our industry, we occasionally experience supplier shortages and are unable to purchase our desired volume\nof products. Increasingly, our vendors are combining and merging together and thus our vendors are becoming more consolidated. As a result, if we are unable to maintain an adequate supply of products, or if vendors do not regularly invest in, introduce to us, and/or make new products available to us for distribution, our revenue and gross profit could suffer considerably. Finally, we cannot provide any assurance that particular products, or product lines, will be available to us, or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. Any limits to product access could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nPeople - The departure, transition or replacement of key personnel could significantly impact results of our operations. If we cannot continue to hire and retain high quality employees, our business and financial results may be negatively affected.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, or increased salary and benefit costs. Like most businesses, our employees are important to our success and we are dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our key management, sales, IT, operational, finance and administrative personnel. We have built our business on a set of core values, and we attempt to hire employees who are committed to these values. We want to hire and retain employees who will fit our culture of providing exceptional service to our vendors and customers. In order to compete and to continue to grow, we must attract, retain and motivate employees, including those in executive, senior management, sales, marketing, logistics, technical support and other operating positions. Our worldwide management structure provides improved management of our operations and improved succession planning within our organization.\nMany of our employees work in small teams to provide specific services to vendors and customers. They are trained to develop their knowledge of vendor products, programs and practices and customer business needs, as well as to enhance the skills required to provide exceptional service and to manage our business. As they gain experience and develop their knowledge and skills, our employees become highly desired by other businesses. Therefore, to retain our employees, we have to provide a satisfying work environment and competitive compensation and benefits. If our costs to retain our skilled employees increase, then our business and financial results may be negatively affected.\nOur continued growth is also dependent, in part, on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management, including but not limited to, Michael Baur, our Chief Executive Officer. We may not be successful in retaining the members of our senior management team or our other key employees. While we have entered into employment agreements with key executives and have obtained a key person life insurance policy on our CEO's life, the loss of the services of Mr. Baur or any member of our senior management team could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The process of identifying management successors creates uncertainty and could become a distraction to our senior management and the Board. We may not be successful in attracting qualified candidates to replace key positions when necessary. As a result, the transition process and the identification and recruitment of candidates to fill senior management positions may be disruptive to our business or operations.\nCompetition - We experience intense competition in all of our markets. Such competition could result in reduced margins and loss of our market share.\nThe markets that we operate in are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of price, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, effectiveness of sales and marketing programs, credit availability, ability to tailor solutions to the needs of our customers, quality and breadth of product line and services and availability of technical and product information. Our competitors include local, regional, national and international distributors as well as hardware manufacturers (including most of our vendors) that sell directly to resellers and to end-users. In addition, we compete with master resellers that sell to franchisees, third party dealers and end-users. Certain of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Certain smaller, regional competitors, who are specialty two-tier or mixed model master resellers, may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Competition has increased for our sales units as broad line and other value-added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets. Such competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of our market share.\nAs a result of intense price competition in our industry, our gross margins and our operating profit margins have historically been narrow, and we expect them to be narrow in the future. To remain competitive, we may be forced to offer more credit or extended payment terms to our customers. This could result in an increase in our need for capital, increase our financing costs, increase our bad debt expenses and have a negative impact on our financial results. We do not offer any assurance that we will not lose market share, or that we will not be forced in the future to reduce our prices in response to the action of our competitors and thereby experience a reduction in our gross margins. We expect continued intense competition as current competitors expand their operations and new competitors enter the market. Our inability to compete successfully against current and future competitors could cause our revenue and earnings to decline.\nLaws and regulations - Changes in tax laws and other laws and regulations may adversely impact us.\nWe are subject to a wide range of local, state and federal laws and regulations both in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate. While we plan our operations based upon existing and anticipated laws and regulations, we cannot anticipate every change and can have only little, if any, impact on others. When new legislation is enacted with minimal advance notice, or when new interpretations or applications of existing laws are made, we may need to implement changes in our policies or structure. We are particularly susceptible to changes in income and other tax laws, laws regulating international trade, and accounting and securities disclosure laws and regulations. To a lesser degree, changes in environmental regulation, including electronic waste recovery legislation, may impact us. In each case, a change in the laws or regulations that we are required to comply with could have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial results.\nViolation of any laws, rules, or regulations applicable to our business could result in fines or other actions by regulatory agencies, increased cost of doing business, reduced profits, or restrictions on our ability to conduct business such as our ability to export products or bans on our ability to offer certain services. Additionally, any significant changes, developments, or new interpretations of laws, rules, or regulations applicable to our business will increase our costs of compliance and may further restrict our overseas client base, may require significant management and other resources to respond appropriately, and may harm our operating results.\nGlobal economic instability - Current world-wide economic conditions and market disruptions may adversely affect our business, pricing strategy and results of operations.\nThe results of our business are subject to the effects of global economic conditions. The slow recovery from the past economic downturn and the continued uncertainty regarding the future health of the global economy may adversely affect revenues, margins, earnings and growth rates. High levels of unemployment and reduced consumer confidence in various markets we have operations in can affect both our company directly and indirectly by affecting other companies that we do business with.\nFinancial markets throughout the world could experience extreme disruption, including, among other things, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations and pricing volatility of others, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues and failure and potential failures of major financial institutions. These developments and/or a related general economic downturn may adversely impact our business and financial condition in a number of ways. Economic slowdowns can lead to reduced information technology spending by end users, which can adversely affect our sales. Economic instability has increased competitive pressure throughout the channels we serve, resulting in pricing pressures that have decreased our margins. This effect may continue in the future.\nGlobal economic downturn and instability may also result in changes in vendor terms and conditions, such as rebates, cash discounts and cooperative marketing efforts, which may result in downward pressure on our gross margins. Tightening of credit in financial markets and general economic downturn may adversely affect the ability of our reseller customers, vendors and service providers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and to perform their obligations under our agreements with them. Instability in financial and currency markets or changes in intergovernmental relations can also lead to limited access to U.S. dollars or other currencies by our customers. This can result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, negatively impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis, result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable being required and lead to elevated levels of obsolete inventory.\nWe continue to be unable to predict any duration of any economic downturn and disruption in financial markets or their effects on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nCredit exposure - We have credit exposure to our reseller customers. Any adverse trends in their businesses could cause us to suffer credit losses.\nWe have credit exposure to our reseller customers and negative trends in their businesses could increase our credit risk. As is customary in our industry, we extend credit to our reseller customers, and most of our sales are on open accounts. We may be unable to collect on receivables if our reseller customers experience decreases in demand for their products and services, do not manage their businesses adequately, or otherwise become less able to pay due to adverse economic conditions or refinancing events. As we grow and compete for business, our typical payment terms tend to be longer, and therefore may increase our credit risk.\nWhile we evaluate our resellers' qualifications for credit and monitor our extensions of credit, these efforts cannot prevent all credit losses, and credit losses in excess of historical levels would negatively impact our performance. In addition, for financial reporting purposes, we estimate future credit losses and establish an appropriate reserve. To the extent that our credit losses exceed those\nreserves, our financial performance will be negatively impacted. There is no guarantee that our operating expenses will not increase as a result of the recognition of bad debt expense from our reseller customers. If there is a substantial deterioration in the collectability of our receivables or if we are unable to collect under existing credit insurance policies, or we fail to take other actions to adequately mitigate such credit risk, our earnings, cash flows and our ability to utilize receivable-based financing could deteriorate.\nIn addition, extending credit to international customers creates additional risks. It is often more difficult to evaluate credit of a customer or obtain credit protections in our international operations. Also, credit cycles and collection periods are typically longer in our international operations. As a result of these factors and other challenges in extending credit to international customers, we generally face greater credit risk from sales internationally compared to domestic sales.\nCentralized functions - We have centralized a number of functions to provide efficient support to our business. As a result, a loss or reduction of use of one of our locations would have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial results.\nIn order to be as efficient as possible, we centralize a number of critical functions. For instance, we currently distribute products in North America from a single warehouse near Memphis, Tennessee. Similarly, for the primary business operations, we utilize a single information system based in the United States for our North American and European operations, while our Latin American operations have separate systems. While we have backup systems and business continuity plans, any significant or lengthy interruption of our ability to provide these centralized functions would significantly impair our ability to continue normal business operations. In addition, the centralization of these functions increases our exposure to local risks, such as the availability of qualified employees and the lessening of competition for critical services, such as freight and communications.\nAlthough we have business interruption insurance, not all losses are covered, and an uninsured loss from electrical or telephone failure, fire or other casualty, water damage, theft, or other disruption would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, there are limits on all of our insurance coverage, and it is possible that losses might exceed that coverage.\nInventory - The value of our inventory may be adversely affected by market and other factors.\nOur business, like that of other distributors, is subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will be adversely affected by price reductions by manufacturers or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of our products or by foreign currency fluctuations. The electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Under the terms of most of our vendor agreements and the policy of most manufacturers of specialty technology products, we have some price protection and stock rotation opportunities with respect to slow-moving or obsolete inventory items. However, these protections are limited in scope and do not protect against all declines in inventory value, excess inventory, or product obsolescence, and in some instances we may not be able to fulfill all necessary conditions or successfully manage such price protection or stock rotation opportunities. In addition, these industry practices are sometimes not reflected in vendor agreements and their application in a particular situation is dependent upon negotiations between our vendors and us. As a result, from time-to-time we are required to write down the value of excess and obsolete inventory, and should any of these write-downs occur at a significant level, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Also, we may have to write-down our inventory due to water damage, theft or other factors that may decrease our number of merchantable products.\nShould there be an economic downturn, it is possible that prices may decline due to an oversupply of product, and therefore, there may be a greater risk of declines in inventory value. In addition, our vendors may become insolvent and unable to fulfill their product obligations to us. Significant declines in inventory value in excess of established inventory reserves or dramatic changes in prevailing technologies could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNarrow gross profit margins - Our narrow gross profit margins significantly impact our operating results.\nOur industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow gross profit margins and operating profit margins. Because of our narrow margins, fluctuations in sales can have a magnified impact on our overall operating results. We may not be able to reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to mitigate any further reductions in profit margins in the future. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure in response to competitive price pressures, our business and operating results could suffer.\nInternal control over financial reporting - The internal control structure we have in place over our financial reporting may not be effective in detecting fraud or errors in a timely manner, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business or the market price of our securities.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, an independent registered public accounting firm must attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions and our reputation may be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline.\nA weakness in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements of our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements resulting in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our share price. Even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. We do not expect our internal control over financial reporting to detect all errors or fraudulent conduct.\nCyber security risk - Our reputation and business may be harmed from cyber security risk and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers' or our business partners' or our own information or other breaches of our information security.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer or employee information or those of service providers or business partners may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third party service provider or business partner. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security, or that of our third party service provider, and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. As a result, our customers' information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our customers' consent.\nIn addition, our third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our business-to-business customers, suppliers and other business partners. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our business information, customer, supplier, and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their consent.\nWe are subject to regulations relating to customer privacy and the protection of personal information. Any such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, customers' or business partners' information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nThird party logistics and warehousing providers - We use third party logistics and warehousing providers in certain parts of the world that may expose us to risks or liabilities based on their execution that may adversely affect our business operations or financial results.\nIn Europe, Brazil and other Latin American countries, we use third parties to provide warehousing and logistics services in order to provide cost effective operations and scale in certain regions. The failure or inability of one or more of these third parties to deliver products from suppliers to us or products from us to our customers for any reason could disrupt our business and harm our reputation and operating results. We work closely with our third party logistics and warehousing providers to anticipate issues,\nand also review public information regarding their financial health. However, issues may not be identified timely, which may lead to lack of or poor execution, loss or litigation. Additionally, deterioration of the financial condition of our logistical and warehousing providers could have an adverse impact on our logistical processes. Poor financial condition of these providers could result in delayed responsiveness or delivery failure, which would ultimately affect our responsiveness to our customers and thus may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nReliance on third parties - We are dependent on third parties for services including the delivery of a majority of our products. Changes in shipping terms or the failure or inability of our third party shippers to perform could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on arrangements with third parties to perform certain services our business depends on and services for our customers, which, if not performed by these third parties in accordance with the terms of the arrangement could result in significant disruptions or costs to our organization, including monetary damages and an adverse effect on our customer relationships.\nIn particular, we are dependent upon major shipping companies, including FedEx and UPS, for the shipment of our products to and from our centralized warehouses. Changes in shipping terms, or the inability of these third party shippers to perform effectively (whether as a result of mechanical failure, casualty loss, labor stoppage, or any other reason), could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we have experienced significant increases in shipping costs due to increases in fuel costs. Additionally, deterioration of the financial condition of our carriers could have an adverse impact on our logistical processes and shipping costs. Poor financial condition of our freight carriers could result in delayed responsiveness in their service lead times, which would ultimately affect our responsiveness to our customers. Additionally, if our carriers were to increase our shipping costs, it may adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass on these higher costs to our customers.\nFair value measurement of contingent consideration, goodwill and other intangible assets - Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities measured at fair value could have a significant effect on our reported earnings.\nWe have structured acquisitions with an upfront payment and additional earnout payments. The acquisition of CDC was structured having an upfront payment with five annual cash installments based upon the financial performance of CDC for the twelve month periods ended on June 30, 2011 through June 30, 2015. The acquisition of Imago Group plc (\"Imago ScanSource\") was structured having an upfront payment with two additional annual cash installments based upon the financial performance of Imago ScanSource for the twelve month periods ended September 30, 2015 through September 30, 2016. The acquisition of Network1 was structured having an upfront payment with four additional annual cash installments based upon the financial performance of Network1 for the twelve month periods ended June 30, 2015 through June 30, 2018.\nIn accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, a liability for the contingent consideration driven by an earn-out must be recorded at the onset of the purchase and must be revalued at every reporting period. Changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded as an adjustment to operating income. These changes can occur due to changes in estimated future financial results, the probabilities of achieving these results, the discount rate reflective of our creditworthiness, and the market risk premium associated with the Brazilian market. Both gains and losses can occur due to changes in these fair value estimates, thus increasing volatility of our earnings. We expect to continue to use this structure for future acquisitions.\nOn at least an annual basis, we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets, including but not limited to customer relationships and trade names, for impairment. This includes continuously monitoring events and circumstances that could trigger an impairment test outside of our annual impairment testing date in the fourth quarter of each year. Testing goodwill and other intangibles for impairment requires the use of significant estimates and other inputs outside of our control. If the carrying value of goodwill in any of our goodwill reporting units or other intangible assets is determined to exceed their respective fair values, we may be required to record significant impairment charges that would adversely affect our operating results. A global economic downturn could impact our prior judgments and assumptions about the fair value of our business, and we may be required to record impairment charges of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future.\nGoodwill impairments - Goodwill impairments and impairments of long-lived assets could have a material non-cash adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe test our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all reporting units, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review. We performed our annual impairment test for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 and determined that no goodwill impairment charge was necessary. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we recorded a non-cash charge for goodwill impairment in our European Communications and Brazilian POS & Barcode reporting units.\nIn the future, should the recent economic uncertainty continue in Latin America, Europe, or other global economies, the fair value of one or more of our reporting units may decrease below its carrying amount and future goodwill impairments that may be material could be recognized. Any declines resulting in a goodwill impairment or long-lived asset impairment may result in material non-cash charges to our earnings. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareholders' equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets.\nAccounting rules - Changes in accounting rules or standards could have a significant adverse effect on our reported earnings.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretations by various governing bodies including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. These governing bodies create and interpret appropriate accounting standards. Future periodic assessments required by current or new accounting standards may result in additional non-cash charges and/or changes in presentation or disclosure. A change from current accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard for contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. This guidance will be applicable to the Company at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019. This change in accounting standard could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nTerrorist or military operations - Future terrorist or military operations could result in a disruption of our operation or loss of assets in certain markets.\nFuture terrorist or military actions, in the United States or abroad, could result in destruction or seizure of assets or suspension or disruption of our operations. Additionally, such actions could affect the operations of our suppliers or customers, resulting in loss of access to products, potential losses on supplier programs, loss of business, higher losses on receivables or inventory, and/or other disruptions in our business, which could negatively affect our operating results. We do not carry broad insurance covering such terrorist or military actions, and even if we were to seek such coverage, the cost would likely be prohibitive.\nNatural disasters and other crises - Exposure to adverse weather conditions or other emergency situations could result in a disruption of our operation or loss of assets in certain markets.\nExtreme weather conditions such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, or other natural disasters, electrical failures, medical pandemics or epidemics, telecommunication failures, or other similar events may disrupt our ability to distribute products. Any of these events could significantly and adversely affect our operational results. Particularly, these events could materially impact us because our business has centralized business operations and thus any major damage done to one of our facilities could greatly impact our operations. While we may mitigate some of this risk through insurance, we cannot guarantee that our losses will not exceed the value of our policies. Any disruption in business may adversely affect our operations or damage relationships with customers.\nFailure to comply with environmental regulations - We are subject to various environmental regulations, and failing to comply with any requirements may adversely affect our business operations or financial results.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. Compliance with these environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business. These laws include the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, (\"RoHS\"), RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU (\"RoHS 2\") and the European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\"WEEE\") as enacted by individual European Union countries and other similar legislation adopted in North America. These directives can make companies involved in the production or distribution of electrical goods, including computers and printers, responsible for collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of recovered products. In addition, these directives and similar legislation can have an impact on the types and design of products we are able to sell in jurisdictions that have adopted such restrictions. While we strive to ensure we are in compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose strict liability. Additionally, we may be held responsible for the prior activities of entities that we have acquired or will acquire in the future. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further,\nenvironmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nLiquidity and capital resources - Market factors may increase the cost and availability of capital. Additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs and growth.\nOur business requires significant levels of capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors. We have an increased demand for capital when our business is expanding, including through acquisitions. Changes in payment terms with either suppliers or customers could increase our capital requirements. We have historically relied upon cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, secured and unsecured borrowings, and, to a lesser extent, borrowings under a subsidiary's line of credit to satisfy our capital needs and to finance growth. While we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will provide sufficient resources to meet our current working capital and cash requirements, if we require an increase in capital to meet our future business needs, such capital may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Changes in how lenders rate our credit worthiness, as well as macroeconomic factors such as an economic downturn and global economic instability may restrict our ability to raise capital in adequate amounts or on terms acceptable to us, and the failure to do so could harm our ability to operate our business.\nIn addition, our cash and cash equivalents are deposited with various financial institutions located in the various countries in which we operate. We endeavor to monitor these financial institutions regularly for credit quality; however, we are exposed to risk of loss on such funds or we may experience significant disruptions in our liquidity needs if one or more of these financial institutions were to suffer bankruptcy or similar restructuring.\nVolatility of Stock Price- The trading price of our common stock\nThe stock market as a whole and the trading prices of companies in the wholesale electronics industry have been volatile. Companies in our industry experience significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. This broad market and industry volatility could significantly reduce the price of our common stock at any time, without regard to our own operating performance. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors; variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates; and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, transactions, partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments.\nA material decline in the price of our common stock may result in the assertion of certain claims against us, and/or the commencement of inquiries and/or investigations against us. A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital, if needed, and the inability for you to obtain a favorable price at which you could sell your shares.\nQuarterly fluctuations - Our net sales and operating results are dependent on a number of factors. Our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and these fluctuations may cause volatility in our stock price.\nOur net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly as a result of changes in demand for our products and services, the introduction of new technology, actions by our competitors, changes in vendors' prices or price protection policies, changes in vendors' business practices or strategies, changes in freight rates, the timing or the addition of operating expenses to support our growth, the timing of major marketing or other service projects, product supply shortages, changes in product mix, the impact of possible disruption caused by integration and reorganization of technology systems, currency fluctuations in countries we have operations, the loss of a major supplier or customer, occurrence of unexpected events, impairments and the general economic factors referenced above. In addition, a substantial portion of our net sales in each quarter results from orders booked in that quarter, which are difficult to accurately forecast in advance. As a result, our performance in one period may vary significantly from our performance in the preceding quarter, and may differ significantly from our forecast of performance from quarter to quarter. The impact of these variances may cause volatility in our stock price. Additionally, any past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in the future as our operating results may fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter. Our narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of the foregoing factors on our operating results. The results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year.\nLitigation - We routinely are involved in litigation that can be costly and lead to adverse results.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a wide range of disputes, some of which result in litigation. In addition, as a public company with a large shareholder base, we are susceptible to class-action and other litigation resulting from disclosures that we make and our other activities. Litigation is expensive to bring and defend, and the outcome of litigation can be adverse and significant. Not all adverse outcomes can be anticipated, and applicable accounting rules do not always require or permit the establishment of a reserve until a final result has occurred or becomes probable and estimable. In some instances we are insured for the potential losses; in other instances we are not. An uninsured or underinsured adverse outcome in significant litigation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We can make no assurances that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these disputes.
