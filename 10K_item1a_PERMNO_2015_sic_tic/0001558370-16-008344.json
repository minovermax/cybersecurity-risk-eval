{"cik": "1082506", "company": "Great Elm Capital Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report, before you decide whether to invest in our securities. The following risks are not the only risks we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe are in the midst of a transition and there are a number of uncertain factors. We are in the midst of a transition and there are a number of uncertain factors including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nThere may be unknown liabilities or obligations related to businesses we have divested;\n\u00b7\nWe are recruiting new members of our board of directors and a new chief financial officer;\n\u00b7\nWe recently hired an interim chief executive officer;\n\u00b7\nWe have signed contracts for our first investment in the asset management business, but we cannot assure you that the transaction will be consummated;\n\u00b7\nOur historical financial statements have been restated to reflect our discontinued operations and those financial statements do not serve as a basis for evaluating our new business;\n\u00b7\nWe are relocating our headquarters and implementing new information systems; and\n\u00b7\nWe have plans to make significant investments but cannot provide specificity as to our future investments or financing plans.\nThese and other factors, including the other risk factors described in this document, make it difficult for you and other market participants to value our company and our prospects. We are unaware of any comparable company that securities analysts can use to benchmark our performance and valuation. We cannot give any assurance that any of the uncertainties or risk factors in this document will be favorably resolved.\nOur growth strategy may not be successful. The process to identify potential investment opportunities and acquisition targets, to investigate and evaluate the future returns therefrom and business prospects thereof and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect to such transactions on mutually acceptable terms can be time consuming and costly. We are likely to encounter intense competition from other companies with similar business objectives to ours, including private equity and venture capital funds, sovereign wealth funds, investment firms with significantly greater financial and other resources and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these companies are well established, well financed and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations.\nBecause we will consider investments in different industries, you have no basis at this time to ascertain the merits or risks of any business that we may ultimately invest in. Our business strategy contemplates investment in one or more operating businesses. We are not limited to acquisitions and/or investments in any particular industry or type of business. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately invest or the target businesses with which we may ultimately invest. We cannot assure you that all of the significant risks present in that opportunity will be properly assessed. Even if we properly assess those risks, some of them may be outside of our control or ability to affect. Except as required under Nasdaq rules and applicable law, we will not seek stockholder approval of any investment that we may pursue, so you will most likely not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of such a transaction before we become committed to the transaction.\nWe may not correctly assess the management teams of the businesses we invest in. The value of the businesses we invest in is driven by the quality of the leaders of those businesses. When evaluating the desirability of a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business' management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target's management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we expected. Should the target's management not possess the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities, the operations and profitability of that business will be negatively impacted.\nSubsequent to an investment, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business that we invest in, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues that may be present inside a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business or outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in us reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants under our debt agreements. Accordingly, you could suffer a significant reduction in the value of your shares.\nChanging conditions in financial markets and the economy could impact us through decreased revenues, losses or other adverse consequences. Global or regional changes in the financial markets or economic conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways, including the following:\n\u00b7\nAdverse changes in the market could also lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees and investment income from managed funds and losses on our own capital invested in managed funds. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could reduce asset management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors.\n\u00b7\nLimitations on the availability of credit, such as occurred during 2008, can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Global market and economic conditions have been disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. Our cost and availability of funding could be affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.\n\u00b7\nNew or increased taxes on compensation payments or financial transactions items may adversely affect our profits, if earned.\n\u00b7\nShould one of our customers, debtors or competitors fail, our business prospects and revenue could be negatively impacted due to negative market sentiment causing customers to cease doing business with us and our lenders to cease extending credit to us, which could adversely affect our business, funding and liquidity.\nWe intend to create bespoke financial products. These initiatives may expose us to unexpected market, legal, operational or reputational risks. We intend to create bespoke financial products that will solve challenges for our customers by using our human and financial resources, including our tax profile, and our risk modeling capabilities. These products may, among other things:\n\u00b7\nnot perform as we model them;\n\u00b7\nhave unknown or unexpected correlations to changes in the economy or markets;\n\u00b7\nrequire the investment of more of our capital than we anticipate;\n\u00b7\nnot be in bankruptcy remote entities even though we have structured them to be bankruptcy remote;\n\u00b7\nnot survive challenge by regulatory bodies or in court;\n\u00b7\nresult in a change in law as legislators and regulators discover unintended consequences of current legislation and regulation;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to indemnity our customer against certain risks;\n\u00b7\nresult in negative publicity for us or our customers; and\n\u00b7\nhave unknown or inadequately planned for structural challenges.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon those of our individual businesses, and our aggregate investment in particular industries. We are a holding company that will make investments in businesses and assets in a number of industries. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon our investments. Any material adverse change in one of our investments or in a particular industry in which we invest may cause material adverse changes to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Concentration of capital we devote to a particular investment or industry may increase the risk that such investment could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations, possibly in a material adverse way. Our portfolio of investments will change from time to time.\nOur ability to successfully grow our new business and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business. Our ability to successfully effect our growth strategy is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. Peter A. Reed is Chief Executive Officer of GECC and is expected to become Chief Investment Officer of GECM upon completion of the Merger. Richard S. Chernicoff has been our lead independent director, chairman of our board and is now our Chief Executive Officer. Our key personnel realize their importance to our business and may demand increased compensation as a result. The loss of our key personnel could severely negative impact the operations and profitability of our business. We compete with many other entities for skilled management and staff employees, including entities that operate in different market sectors than us. Delays in recruiting and costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could materially adversely affect results of operations.\nDifficult market conditions can adversely affect our asset management business in many ways, by reducing the value or performance of our funds (including our invested funds and funds invested by third parties) or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition. The build-out of our asset management business is affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions and events throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws and regulations, market perceptions and other factors. In addition, we have substantially invested in GECC. Adverse changes could lead to a reduction in investment income, losses on our own capital invested and lower revenues from asset management fees. Such adverse changes may also lead to a decrease in new capital raised and may cause investors to withdraw their investments and commitments. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could reduce asset management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that may make it more difficult to attract new investors or retain existing investors.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or shares of our preferred stock to obtain additional financial resources, as acquisition currency or under employee incentive plans. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of\nour stockholders and likely present other risks. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock from time to time in their business judgement up to the amount of our then authorized capitalization. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock, and may issue shares of our preferred stock. These issuances:\n\u00b7\nmay significantly dilute your equity interests;\n\u00b7\nrequire you to make an additional investment in us or suffer dilution of your equity interest;\n\u00b7\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of shares of our common stock if shares of preferred stock are issued with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock;\n\u00b7\ncould cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued;\nwhich may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u00b7\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in us. We may choose to incur substantial debt to finance our growth plans. The incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u00b7\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating cash flows are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u00b7\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach covenants that require the maintenance of financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u00b7\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;\n\u00b7\nour inability to pay dividends on our common stock;\n\u00b7\nusing a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nincreased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\u00b7\nlimitation on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act), we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to execute our growth plans. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments, and\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities,\neach of which may make it difficult for us to run our business.\nIn addition, the law may impose upon us burdensome requirements, including:\n\u00b7\nregistration as an investment company;\n\u00b7\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u00b7\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nThere are conflicts of interest involving MAST Capital and its affiliates. These conflicts of interest, include, among others:\n\u00b7\nFunds managed by MAST Capital are our largest stockholder;\n\u00b7\nFunds managed by MAST Capital own all of our Senior Secured Notes due 2019;\n\u00b7\nPeter A. Reed, a partner in MAST Capital, is a member of our board of directors and chairman of our board of directors\u2019 nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee;\n\u00b7\nMr. Reed is Chief Executive Officer of GECC Mr. Reed will become Chief Investment Officer of GECM upon closing of the Merger;\n\u00b7\nAll of the partners of MAST Capital and all of its employees will become our employees or consultants upon closing the Merger and thereafter will continue to be partners or employees of MAST Capital devoting substantial time to MAST Capital\u2019s business;\n\u00b7\nMAST Capital will be obligated to reimburse us for its allocable portion of costs of running our asset management business;\n\u00b7\nWe will assume MAST Capital\u2019s commercial contracts, leases and other obligations at the time of the Merger closing; and\n\u00b7\nMAST Capital, its partners and employees will receive compensation, including minority ownership of one of our subsidiaries, in connection with GECC\u2019s business\nThese conflicts of interest may result in arrangements that are not as favorable to us as those available on an arms-length basis. The significant ownership stake held by the MAST Funds may result in MAST Capital and its partners having undue influence over our affairs. These conflicts of interests may adversely affect the perception of our company, the value of our common stock or the willingness of new investors to invest in us.\nOur officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us, subject to their fiduciary duties under applicable law.\nWe may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that may be affiliated with or have relationships with MAST Capital, our executive officers, directors which may raise potential conflicts of interest. In light of the involvement of our executive officers and directors with other entities in the investment management business and otherwise, we may decide to acquire or do business with one or more businesses affiliated with MAST Capital or our executive officers and directors. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. Such entities may compete with us. We could pursue an affiliate transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. Potential conflicts of interest may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\nIncreased competition may adversely affect our revenues, profitability and staffing. All aspects of our business are intensely competitive. We will compete directly with a number of bank holding companies and commercial banks, other brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, BDCs, private equity funds, and other financial institutions. In addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business, there has been increasing competition from others offering financial services, including automated trading and other services based on technological innovations. Increased competition or an adverse change in our competitive position could lead to a reduction of business and therefore a reduction of revenues and profits.\nCompetition also extends to the hiring and retention of highly skilled employees. A competitor may be successful in hiring away employees, which may result in us losing business formerly serviced by such employees. Competition can also raise our costs of hiring and retaining the employees we need to effectively operate our business.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations. Firms that engage in securities and derivatives trading, wealth and asset management and investment banking must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by national and state governments and regulatory and self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover all aspects of the financial services business, including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption efforts, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.\nRegulators will supervise our business activities to monitor compliance with laws, rules and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied. At any moment in time, we may be subject to one or more such investigation or similar reviews. There can be no assurance that our operations will not violate such laws, rules, or regulations and such investigations and similar reviews will not result in adverse regulatory requirements, regulatory enforcement actions and/or fines.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax asset, which would also have to be reduced if U.S. federal income tax rates are lowered. At June 30, 2016, we have significant deferred tax assets. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income, we will not be able to fully realize the recorded amount of the gross deferred tax asset. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of our Federal NOL carryforwards, the NOLs would expire unused. Our projections of future taxable income required to fully realize the recorded amount of the gross deferred tax asset reflect numerous assumptions about our operating businesses and investments, and are subject to change as conditions change specific to our business units, investments or general economic conditions. Changes that are adverse to us could result in the need to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a charge to results of operations and a decrease to stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, if U.S. federal income tax rates are lowered, we would be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset with a corresponding reduction to earnings during the period.\nIf our tax filing positions were to be challenged by federal, state and local or foreign tax jurisdictions, we may not be wholly successful in defending our tax filing positions. We record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and if so estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our gross deferred tax asset, either of which result could be significant to our financial position, cash balances and results of operations.\nWe may incur losses if our risk management is not effective. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure. Our risk management processes and procedures are designed to limit our exposure to acceptable levels as we conduct our business. We intend to develop and apply a comprehensive framework of limits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities. The size of the limit reflects our risk tolerance for a certain activity. The framework is expected to include investment position and exposure limits on a gross and net basis, scenario analysis and stress tests, value-at-risk, sensitivities, exposure concentrations, aged inventory, amount of Level 3 assets, counterparty exposure, leverage, cash capital, and performance analysis. While we intend to employ various risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application, including risk tolerance determinations, cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. As a result, we may incur losses notwithstanding our risk management processes and procedures.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth. Our businesses will be highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, transactions across numerous and diverse markets, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain its ability to expand its businesses.\nOur financial and other data processing systems will rely on access to and the functionality of operating systems maintained by third parties. If the accounting, trading or other data processing systems on which we are dependent are unable to meet increasingly demanding standards for processing and security or, if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be adversely affected. Such consequences may include our inability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business.\nOur operations will rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. Additionally, if a customer\u2019s computer system, network or other technology is compromised by unauthorized access, we may face losses or other adverse consequences by unknowingly entering into unauthorized transactions. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our, our customers\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. Furthermore, such events may cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our customers\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations, including the transmission and execution of unauthorized transactions.\nWe may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. The increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices as well as cloud computing may also heighten these and other operational risks. We and our third party providers are the subject of attempted unauthorized access, computer viruses and malware, and cyber attacks designed to disrupt of degrade service or cause other damage and denial of service. Additional challenges are posed by external parties, including foreign state actors. There can be no assurance that such unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur in the future, and they could occur more frequently and on a larger scale. Legal liability arising from such risks may harm our business. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability.\nRecent legislation and new or pending regulation may significantly affect our business. In recent years, there has been significant legislation and increased regulation affecting the financial services industry. These legislative and regulatory initiatives affect us, our competitors, our managed investment products and our customers. These changes could have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us, require us to raise and hold additional equity capital and otherwise adversely affect its business. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur financial and operational controls may not be adequate. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that financial controls, the level and knowledge of personnel, operational abilities, legal and compliance controls and other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, if we acquire new businesses and introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties integrating their controls and systems, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nFrom time to time we are subject to litigation, for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which if adversely determined, may have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We are and may become parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business or not significant to our consolidated financial position or liquidity. Although our current assessment is that, other than as disclosed in this report, there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact, if our assessment proves to be in error, then the outcome of litigation could have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the application of ASC 740-20 allocating taxes between continuing operations and discontinued operations. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-An Integrated Framework (2013). We are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is subject to transfer restrictions. We have significant NOLs and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could result in limitations on the use of the tax attributes, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of 5% or more of our common stock and the ability of persons or entities now owning 5% or more of our common shares from acquiring additional common shares. The restriction will remain until the earliest of (1) the repeal of Section 382 of the Code or any successor statute if our board of directors determines that the restriction on transfer is no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of tax benefits, (2) the close of business on the first day of a taxable year as to which our board of directors determines that no tax benefits may be carried forward, (3) such date as our board of directors may fix for expiration of transfer restrictions and (4) January 29, 2018. The restriction may be waived by our board of directors on a case by case basis. You are advised to carefully monitor your ownership of our common shares and consult your own legal advisors and/or us to determine whether your ownership of our common shares approaches the proscribed level.\nWe also have a tax benefits preservation rights plan that would be triggered if any person acquires 4.99% or more of our common stock without prior approval by our board of directors. Holders of more than 4.99% of our common stock on the day the rights plan was adopted were exempted from this limitation as to the number shares they held at the time of adoption of the rights plan.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt. Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u00b7\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u00b7\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the ability for persons to acquire 4.99% or more of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nproviding our board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; and\n\u00b7\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 86990, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "GEC"}
