{"cik": "1664703", "company": "Bloom Energy Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below, or of additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business, Industry and Sales\nThe distributed generation industry is an emerging market and distributed generation may not receive widespread market acceptance.\nThe distributed generation industry is still relatively nascent in an otherwise mature and heavily regulated industry, and we cannot be sure that potential customers will accept distributed generation broadly, or our Energy Server products specifically. Enterprises may be unwilling to adopt our solution over traditional or competing power sources for any number of reasons including the perception that our technology is unproven, they lack confidence in our business model, the perceived unavailability of back-up service providers to operate and maintain the Energy Servers, and lack of awareness of our product or their perception of regulatory or political headwinds. Because this is an emerging industry, broad acceptance of our products and services is subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. If the market develops more slowly than we anticipate, our business will be harmed.\nOur limited operating history and our nascent industry make evaluating our business and future prospects difficult.\nFrom our inception in 2001 through 2009, we were focused principally on research and development activities relating to our Energy Server technology. We did not deploy our first Energy Server and did not recognize any revenue until 2009. As a result, we have a limited history operating our business at its current scale. Furthermore, our Energy Server is a new type of product in the nascent distributed energy industry. Consequently, predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting for our expenses is difficult, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. If actual results differ from our estimates or if we adjust our estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur products involve a lengthy sales and installation cycle and, if we fail to close sales on a regular and timely basis, our business could be harmed.\nOur sales cycle is typically 12 to 18 months but can vary considerably. In order to make a sale, we must typically provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our product and its technology. The period between initial discussions with a potential customer and the eventual sale of even a single product typically depends on a number of factors, including the potential customer\u2019s budget and decision as to the type of financing it chooses to use as well as the arrangement of such financing. Prospective customers often undertake a significant evaluation process which may further extend the sales cycle. Once a customer makes a formal decision to purchase our product, the fulfillment of the sales order by us requires a substantial amount of time. Generally, the time between the entry into a sales contract with a customer and the installation of our Energy Servers can range from nine to twelve months or more. This lengthy sales and installation cycle is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control. Because of both the long sales and long installation cycles, we may expend significant resources without having certainty of generating a sale.\nThese lengthy sales and installation cycles increase the risk that an installation may not be completed. In some instances, a customer can cancel an order for a particular site prior to installation, and we may be unable to recover some or all of our costs in connection with design, permitting, installation and site preparations incurred prior to cancellation. Cancellation rates can be between 10% and 20% in any given period due to factors outside of our control including an inability to install an Energy Server at the customer\u2019s chosen location because of permitting or other regulatory issues, unanticipated changes in the cost, or other reasons unique to each customer. Our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and many of our expenses are fixed. If we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant resources or if we experience delays or cancellations, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Since we do not recognize revenue on the sales of our products until installation and acceptance, a small fluctuation in the timing of the completion of our sales transactions could cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.\nOur Energy Servers have significant upfront costs, and we will need to attract investors to help customers finance purchases.\nOur Energy Servers have significant upfront costs. In order to assist our customers in obtaining financing for our products, we have traditional lease programs with two leasing partners who have prequalified our product and provide financing for customers through various leasing arrangements. In addition to the traditional lease model, we also offer Power Purchase Agreement Programs, including Third-Party PPAs, in which financing the cost of the Energy Server is provided by an Operating Company and funded by a subsidiary investment entity (an \"Investment Company\") which is financed by us and/or in combination with Equity Investors. We refer to the Operating Company and its subsidiary Investment Company collectively as a PPA Entity. In recent periods, the substantial majority of our end customers have elected to finance their purchases, typically through Third Party PPAs.\nWe will need to grow committed financing capacity with existing partners or attract additional partners to support our growth. Generally, at any point in time, the deployment of a portion of our backlog is contingent on securing available financing. Our ability to attract third-party financing depends on many factors that are outside of our control, including the investors\u2019 ability to utilize tax credits and other government incentives, our perceived creditworthiness and the condition of credit markets generally. Our financing of customer purchases of our Energy Servers is subject to conditions such as the customer\u2019s credit quality and the expected minimum internal rate of return on the customer engagement, and if these conditions are not satisfied, we may be unable to finance purchases of our Energy Servers, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue in a particular period. If we are unable to help our customers arrange financing for our Energy Servers generally, our business will be harmed. For example, we have been working with financing sources to arrange for additional Third-Party PPA Entities, one of which will need to be finalized in order for our customers to arrange financing so that we can complete our planned installations in the second quarter of 2019.\nIf we are unable to procure financing partners willing to finance such deployments, our business would be negatively impacted.\nThe economic benefits of our Energy Servers to our customers depends on the cost of electricity available from alternative sources including local electric utility companies, which cost structure is subject to change.\nWe believe that a customer\u2019s decision to purchase our Energy Servers is significantly influenced by the price, the price predictability of electricity generated by our Energy Servers in comparison to the retail price and the future price outlook of electricity from the local utility grid and other renewable energy sources. The economic benefit of our Energy Servers to our customers includes, among other things, the benefit of reducing such customer\u2019s payments to the local utility company. The rates at which electricity is available from a customer\u2019s local electric utility company is subject to change and any changes in such rates may affect the relative benefits of our Energy Servers. Even in markets where we are competitive today, rates for electricity could decrease and render our Energy Servers uncompetitive. Several factors could lead to a reduction in the price or future price outlook for grid electricity, including the impact of energy conservation initiatives that reduce electricity consumption, construction of additional power generation plants (including nuclear, coal or natural gas) and technological developments by others in the electric power industry which could result in electricity being available at costs lower than those that can be achieved from our Energy Servers. If the retail price of grid electricity does not increase over time at the rate that we or our customers expect, it could reduce demand for our Energy Servers and harm our business.\nFurther, the local electric utility may impose \u201cdeparting load,\u201d \u201cstandby,\u201d or other charges on our customers in connection with their acquisition of our Energy Servers, the amounts of which are outside of our control and which may have a material impact on the economic benefit of our Energy Servers to our customers. Changes in the rates offered by local electric utilities and/or in the applicability or amounts of charges and other fees imposed by such utilities on customers acquiring our Energy Servers could adversely affect the demand for our Energy Servers.\nIn some states and countries, the current low cost of grid electricity, even together with available subsidies, does not render our product economically attractive. If we are unable to reduce our costs to a level at which our Energy Servers would be competitive in such markets, or if we are unable to generate demand for our Energy Servers based on benefits other than electricity cost savings, our potential for growth may be limited.\nFurthermore, an increase in the price of natural gas or curtailment of availability could make our Energy Servers less economically attractive to potential customers and reduce demand.\nWe rely on net metering arrangements that are subject to change.\nBecause our Energy Servers are designed to operate at a constant output twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week and our customers\u2019 demand for electricity typically fluctuates over the course of the day or week, there are often periods when our Energy Servers are producing more electricity than a customer may require, and such excess electricity must be exported to the\nlocal electric utility. Many, but not all, local electric utilities provide compensation to our customers for such electricity under \u201cnet metering\u201d programs. Utility tariffs, interconnection agreements and net metering requirements are subject to changes in availability and terms. At times in the past, such changes have had the effect of significantly reducing or eliminating the benefits of such programs. Changes in the availability of, or benefits offered by, utility tariffs, the net metering requirements or interconnection agreements in place in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect the demand for our Energy Servers.\nWe currently face and will continue to face significant competition.\nWe compete for customers, financing partners, and incentive dollars with other electric power providers. Many providers of electricity, such as traditional utilities and other companies offering distributed generation products, have longer operating histories, have customer incumbency advantages, have access to and influence with local and state governments, and have access to more capital resources than do we. Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as energy storage, wind, solar, or hydro power generation, or improvements in the efficiency or cost of traditional energy sources, including coal, oil, natural gas used in combustion, or nuclear power, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we cannot anticipate. We may also face new competitors who are not currently in the market. If we fail to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with grid electricity or new competitors, our growth will be limited which would adversely affect our business results.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue and backlog from a limited number of customers, and the loss of or a significant reduction in orders from a large customer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and other key metrics.\nIn any particular period, a substantial amount of our total revenue could come from a relatively small number of customers. As an example, in the year ended December 31, 2017, two customers accounted for approximately 53% of our total revenue. In 2018, two customers accounted for approximately 54% of our total revenue. One of these customers, the Southern Company, wholly owns a Third-Party PPA, and this entity purchases Bloom Energy Servers, that are then provided to various end customers under PPAs. The loss of any large customer order or any delays in installations of new Energy Servers with any large customer could materially and adversely affect our business results.\nRisks Relating to Our Products and Manufacturing\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to increase our production capacity, and we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective manner.\nTo the extent we are successful in growing our business, we may need to increase our production capacity. Our ability to plan, construct, and equip additional manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe expansion or construction of any manufacturing facilities will be subject to the risks inherent in the development and construction of new facilities, including risks of delays and cost overruns as a result of factors outside our control such as delays in government approvals, burdensome permitting conditions, and delays in the delivery of manufacturing equipment and subsystems that we manufacture or obtain from suppliers.\n\u2022\nIt may be difficult to expand our business internationally without additional manufacturing facilities located outside the United States. Adding manufacturing capacity in any international location will subject us to new laws and regulations including those pertaining to labor and employment, environmental and export import. In addition, it brings with it the risk of managing larger scale foreign operations.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to achieve the production throughput necessary to achieve our target annualized production run rate at our current and future manufacturing facilities.\n\u2022\nManufacturing equipment may take longer and cost more to engineer and build than expected, and may not operate as required to meet our production plans.\n\u2022\nWe may depend on third-party relationships in the development and operation of additional production capacity, which may subject us to the risk that such third parties do not fulfill their obligations to us under our arrangements with them.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to attract or retain qualified personnel.\nIf we are unable to expand our manufacturing facilities, we may be unable to further scale our business. If the demand for our Energy Servers or our production output decreases or does not rise as expected, we may not be able to spread a\nsignificant amount of our fixed costs over the production volume, resulting in a greater than expected per unit fixed cost, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIf we are not able to continue to reduce our cost structure in the future, our ability to become profitable may be impaired.\nWe must continue to reduce the manufacturing costs for our Energy Servers to expand our market. Additionally, certain of our existing service contracts were entered into based on projections regarding service costs reductions that assume continued advances in our manufacturing and services processes which we may be unable to realize. While we have been successful in reducing our manufacturing and services costs to date, the cost of components and raw materials, for example, could increase in the future. Any such increases could slow our growth and cause our financial results and operational metrics to suffer. In addition, we may face increases in our other expenses including increases in wages or other labor costs as well as installation, marketing, sales or related costs. We may continue to make significant investments to drive growth in the future. In order to expand into new electricity markets (in which the price of electricity from the grid is lower) while still maintaining our current margins, we will need to continue to reduce our costs. Increases in any of these costs or our failure to achieve projected cost reductions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and harm our business and prospects. If we are unable to reduce our cost structure in the future, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects.\nIf our Energy Servers contain manufacturing defects, our business and financial results could be harmed.\nOur Energy Servers are complex products and they may contain undetected or latent errors or defects. In the past, we have experienced latent defects only discovered once the Energy Server is deployed in the field. Changes in our supply chain or the failure of our suppliers to otherwise provide us with components or materials that meet our specifications could also introduce defects into our products. In addition, as we grow our manufacturing volume, the chance of manufacturing defects could increase. Any manufacturing defects or other failures of our Energy Servers to perform as expected could cause us to incur significant re-engineering costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, and significantly and adversely affect customer satisfaction, market acceptance, and our business reputation.\nFurthermore, we may be unable to correct manufacturing defects or other failures of our Energy Servers in a manner satisfactory to our customers, which could adversely affect customer satisfaction, market acceptance, and our business reputation.\nThe performance of our Energy Servers may be affected by factors outside of our control, which could result in harm to our business and financial results.\nField conditions, such as the quality of the natural gas supply and utility processes which vary by region and may be subject to seasonal fluctuations, have affected the performance of our Energy Servers and are not always possible to predict until the Energy Server is in operation. Although we believe we have designed new generations of Energy Servers to better withstand the variety of field conditions we have encountered, as we move into new geographies and deploy new service configurations, we may encounter new and unanticipated field conditions. Adverse impacts on performance may require us to incur significant re-engineering costs or divert the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts. Furthermore, we may be unable to adequately address the impacts of factors outside of our control in a manner satisfactory to our customers. Any of these circumstances could significantly and adversely affect customer satisfaction, market acceptance, and our business reputation.\nIf our estimates of useful life for our Energy Servers are inaccurate or we do not meet service and performance warranties and guaranties, or if we fail to accrue adequate warranty and guaranty reserves, our business and financial results could be harmed.\nWe offer certain customers the opportunity to renew their operations and maintenance service agreements on an annual basis, for up to 25 years, at prices predetermined at the time of purchase of the Energy Server. We also provide performance warranties and guaranties covering the efficiency and output performance of our Energy Servers. Our pricing of these contracts and our reserves for warranty and replacement are based upon our estimates of the life of our Energy Servers and their components, including assumptions regarding improvements in useful life that may fail to materialize. We do not have a long history with a large number of field deployments, and our estimates may prove to be incorrect. Failure to meet these performance warranties and guaranty levels may require us to replace the Energy Servers at our expense or refund their cost to the customer, or require us to make cash payments to the customer based on actual performance, as compared to expected performance, capped at a percentage of the relevant equipment purchase prices. We accrue for product warranty costs and recognize losses on service or performance warranties when required by U.S. GAAP based on our estimates of costs that may be incurred and based on historical experience. However, as we expect our customers to renew their maintenance service\nagreements each year, the total liability over time may be more than the accrual. Actual warranty expenses have in the past been and may in the future be greater than we have assumed in our estimates, the accuracy of which may be hindered due to our limited history operating at our current scale.\nEarly generations of our Energy Server did not have the useful life and did not perform at an output and efficiency level that we expected. We implemented a fleet decommissioning program for our early generation Energy Servers in our PPA I program, which resulted in a significant adjustment to revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2015, as we would otherwise have failed to meet efficiency and output warranties. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 58 megawatts in total deployed early generation servers, including our first and second generation servers, out of our total installed base of 372 megawatts. We expect that our deployed early generation Energy Servers may continue to perform at a lower output and efficiency level and, as a result, the maintenance costs may exceed the contracted prices that we expect to generate if our customers continue to renew their maintenance service agreements in respect of those servers.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with construction, utility interconnection, cost overruns and delays, including those related to obtaining government permits and other contingencies that may arise in the course of completing installations.\nBecause we generally do not recognize revenue on the sales of our Energy Servers until installation and acceptance, our financial results are dependent, to a large extent, on the timeliness of the installation of our Energy Servers. Furthermore, in some cases, the installation of our Energy Servers may be on a fixed price basis, which subjects us to the risk of cost overruns or other unforeseen expenses in the installation process.\nThe construction, installation, and operation of our Energy Servers at a particular site is also generally subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national, state, and local laws and ordinances relating to building codes, safety, environmental protection, and related matters, and typically require various local and other governmental approvals and permits, including environmental approvals and permits, that vary by jurisdiction. In some cases, these approvals and permits require periodic renewal. It is difficult and costly to track the requirements of every individual authority having jurisdiction over our installations, to design our Energy Servers to comply with these varying standards, and to obtain all applicable approvals and permits. We cannot predict whether or when all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether the conditions associated with the permits will be achievable. The denial of a permit or utility connection essential to a project or the imposition of impractical conditions would impair our ability to develop the project. In addition, we cannot predict whether the permitting process will be lengthened due to complexities and appeals. Delay in the review and permitting process for a project can impair or delay our and our customers\u2019 abilities to develop that project or may increase the cost so substantially that the project is no longer attractive to us or our customers. Furthermore, unforeseen delays in the review and permitting process could delay the timing of the installation of our Energy Servers and could therefore adversely affect the timing of the recognition of revenue related to the installation, which could harm our operating results in a particular period.\nIn addition, the completion of many of our installations is dependent upon the availability of and timely connection to the natural gas grid and the local electric grid. In some jurisdictions, the local utility company(ies) or the municipality has denied our request for connection or has required us to reduce the size of certain projects. Any delays in our ability to connect with utilities, delays in the performance of installation-related services, or poor performance of installation-related services by our general contractors or sub-contractors will have a material adverse effect on our results and could cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.\nFurthermore, we rely on the ability of our third party general contractors to install Energy Servers at our customers\u2019 sites and to meet our installation requirements. We currently work with a limited number of general contractors, which has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to make installations as planned. Our work with contractors or their sub-contractors may have the effect of us being required to comply with additional rules (including rules unique to our customers), working conditions, site remediation, and other union requirements, which can add costs and complexity to an installation project. The timeliness, thoroughness, and quality of the installation-related services performed by some of our general contractors and their sub-contractors in the past have not always met our expectations or standards and in the future may not meet our expectations and standards.\nThe failure of our suppliers to continue to deliver necessary raw materials or other components of our Energy Servers in a timely manner could prevent us from delivering our products within required time frames, and could cause installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments, and damage to our reputation.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for some of the raw materials and components for our Energy Servers, including certain rare earth materials and other materials that may be of limited supply. If our suppliers provide insufficient inventory at the level of quality required to meet customer demand or if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide us with the contracted quantities (as we have limited or in some case no alternatives for supply), our results of\noperations could be materially and negatively impacted. If we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with our suppliers, or if there is otherwise a shortage or lack of availability of any required raw materials or components, we may be unable to manufacture our Energy Servers or our Energy Servers may be available only at a higher cost or after a long delay. Such delays could prevent us from delivering our Energy Servers to our customers within required time frames and cause order cancellations. We have had to create our own supply chain for some of the components and materials utilized in our fuel cells. We have made significant expenditures in the past to develop our supply chain. In many cases, we entered into contractual relationships with suppliers to jointly develop the components we needed. These activities were time and capital intensive. Accordingly, the number of suppliers we have for some of our components and materials is limited and in some cases sole sourced. Some of our suppliers use proprietary processes to manufacture components. We may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers without considerable delay, expense, or at all, as replacing these suppliers could require us either to make significant investments to bring the capability in-house or to invest in a new supply chain partner. Some of our suppliers are smaller, private companies, heavily dependent on us as a customer. If our suppliers face difficulties obtaining the credit or capital necessary to expand their operations when needed, they could be unable to supply necessary raw materials and components needed to support our planned sales and services operations, which would negatively impact our sales volumes and cash flows.\nMoreover, we may experience unanticipated disruptions to operations or other difficulties with our supply chain or internalized supply processes due to exchange rate fluctuations, volatility in regional markets from where materials are obtained (particularly China and Taiwan), changes in the general macroeconomic outlook, global trade disputes, political instability, expropriation or nationalization of property, civil strife, strikes, insurrections, acts of terrorism, acts of war, or natural disasters. The failure by us to obtain raw materials or components in a timely manner or to obtain raw materials or components that meet our quantity and cost requirements could impair our ability to manufacture our Energy Servers or increase their costs or service costs of our existing portfolio of Energy Servers under maintenance services agreements. If we cannot obtain substitute materials or components on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we could be prevented from delivering our Energy Servers to our customers within required timeframes, which could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to meet quality standards, and the failure of our suppliers to meet or exceed those quality standards could cause delays in the delivery of our products, cause unanticipated servicing costs, and cause damage to our reputation.\nWe have, in some instances, entered into long-term supply agreements that could result in insufficient inventory and negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe have entered into long-term supply agreements with certain suppliers. Some of these supply agreements provide for fixed or inflation-adjusted pricing, substantial prepayment obligations and in a few cases, supplier purchase commitments. These arrangements could mean that we end up paying for inventory that we did not need or that was at a higher price than the market. Further, we face significant specific counterparty risk under long-term supply agreements when dealing with suppliers without a long, stable production and financial history. Given the uniqueness of our product, many of our suppliers do not have a long operating history and are private companies that may not have substantial capital resources. In the event any such supplier experiences financial difficulties, it may be difficult or impossible, or may require substantial time and expense, for us to recover any or all of our prepayments. We do not know whether we will be able to maintain long-term supply relationships with our critical suppliers or whether we may secure new long-term supply agreements. Additionally, many of our parts and materials are procured from foreign suppliers, which exposes us to risks including unforeseen increases in costs or interruptions in supply arising from changes in applicable international trade regulations such as taxes, tariffs or quotas. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our financial condition and our results of operations.\nWe face supply chain competition, including competition from businesses in other industries, which could result in insufficient inventory and negatively affect our results of operations.\nCertain of our suppliers also supply parts and materials to other businesses including businesses engaged in the production of consumer electronics and other industries unrelated to fuel cells. As a relatively low-volume purchaser of certain of these parts and materials, we may be unable to procure a sufficient supply of the items in the event that our suppliers fail to produce sufficient quantities to satisfy the demands of all of their customers, which could materially harm our financial condition and our results of operations.\nWe, and some of our suppliers, obtain capital equipment used in our manufacturing process from sole suppliers and, if this equipment is damaged or otherwise unavailable, our ability to deliver our Energy Servers on time will suffer.\nSome of the capital equipment used to manufacture our products and some of the capital equipment used by our suppliers have been developed and made specifically for us, are not readily available from multiple vendors, and would be\ndifficult to repair or replace if they did not function properly. If any of these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or go out of business or if there were any damage to or a breakdown of our manufacturing equipment and we could not obtain replacement equipment in a timely manner, our business would suffer. In addition, a supplier\u2019s failure to supply this equipment in a timely manner with adequate quality and on terms acceptable to us could disrupt our production schedule or increase our costs of production and service.\nPossible new tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent on the availability of raw materials and components for our Energy Servers, particularly electrical components common in the semiconductor industry, specialty steel products / processing and raw materials. Recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have increased the cost of raw materials for our Energy Servers and decreased the available supply. Additional new tariffs or other trade protection measures which are proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliation measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain raw materials, which tariffs may exacerbate. Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and components could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our Energy Servers for our customers or require us to pay higher prices in order to obtain these raw materials or components from other sources, which could affect our business and our results of operations. While it is too early to predict how the recently enacted tariffs on imported steel will impact our business, the imposition of tariffs on items imported by us from China or other countries could increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Government Incentive Programs\nOur business currently depends on the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives, and the reduction, modification, or elimination of such benefits could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results.\nThe U.S. federal government and some state and local governments provide incentives to end users and purchasers of our Energy Servers in the form of rebates, tax credits, and other financial incentives, such as system performance payments and payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation. In addition, some countries outside the U.S. also provide incentives to end users and purchasers of our Energy Servers. We currently sell our Energy Servers in the Republic of Korea where Renewable Portfolio Standards (\"RPS\") are in place to promote the adoption of renewable power generation, including fuel cells. Our Energy Servers have qualified for tax exemptions, incentives, or other customer incentives in many states including the states of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. Some states have utility procurement programs and/or renewable portfolio standards for which our technology is eligible. Our Energy Servers are currently installed in eleven U.S. states, each of which may have its own enabling policy framework. We rely on these governmental rebates, tax credits, and other financial incentives to significantly lower the effective price of the Energy Servers to our customers in the U. S. and the Republic of Korea. Our financing partners and Equity Investors in Bloom Electrons programs may also take advantage of these financial incentives, lowering the cost of capital and energy to our customers. However, these incentives or RPS may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as a matter of regulatory or legislative policy.\nFor example, the previous federal investment tax credit (\"ITC\"), a federal tax incentive for fuel cell production, expired on December 31, 2016. Without the availability of the ITC benefit incentive, we lowered the price of our Energy Servers to ensure the economics to our customers would remain the same as it was prior to losing the ITC benefit, adversely affecting our gross profit. While the ITC was reinstated by the U.S Congress on February 9, 2018 and made retroactive to January 1, 2017, under current law it will phase out on December 31, 2022.\nAs another example, the California Self Generation Incentive Program (\"SGIP\") is a program administered by the California Public Utilities Commission (\"CPUC\") which provides incentives to investor-owned utility customers that install eligible distributed energy resources. In July 2016, the CPUC modified the SGIP to provide a smaller allocation of the incentives available to generating technologies such as our Energy Servers and a larger allocation to storage technologies. As modified, the SGIP will require all eligible power generation sources consuming natural gas to use a minimum 50% biogas to receive SGIP funds in 2019 and 100% in 2020. In addition, the CPUC provided a further limitation on the available allocation of funds that any one participant may claim under the SGIP. The SGIP will expire on January 21, 2021 absent any extension. Our billings for product accepted derived from customers benefiting from the SGIP represented approximately 4% and 12% of total billings for product accepted for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nChanges in federal, state, or local programs or the RPS in the Republic of Korea could reduce demand for our Energy Servers, impair sales financing, and adversely impact our business results. The continuation of these programs depends upon political support which to date has been bipartisan and durable. Nevertheless, one set of political activists aggressively seeks to eliminate these programs while another set seeks to deny access to these programs for any technology that relies on natural gas, regardless of the technology\u2019s positive contribution to reducing air pollution, reducing carbon emissions or enabling electric service to be more reliable and resilient.\nWe rely on tax equity financing arrangements to realize the benefits provided by investment tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation and, in the event these programs are terminated, our financial results could be harmed.\nWe expect that any Energy Server deployments through financed transactions (including our Bloom Electrons programs, our leasing programs and any Third-Party PPA Programs) will receive capital from financing parties (\"Equity Investors\") who derive a significant portion of their economic returns through tax benefits. Equity Investors are generally entitled to substantially all of the project\u2019s tax benefits, such as those provided by the ITC and Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (\"MACRS\") or bonus depreciation, until the Equity Investors achieve their respective agreed rates of return. The number of and available capital from potential Equity Investors is limited, we compete with other energy companies eligible for these tax benefits to access such investors, and the availability of capital from Equity Investors is subject to fluctuations based on factors outside of our control such as macroeconomic trends and changes in applicable taxation regimes. Concerns regarding our limited operating history, lack of profitability and that we are only the party who can perform operations and maintenance on our energy servers have made it difficult to attract investors in the past. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future depends on the continued confidence of banks and other financing sources in our business model, the market for our Energy Servers, and the continued availability of tax benefits applicable to our Energy Servers. In addition, conditions in the general economy and financial and credit markets may result in the contraction of available tax equity financing. If we are unable to enter into tax equity financing agreements with attractive pricing terms, or at all, we may not be able to obtain the capital needed to fund our financing programs or use the tax benefits provided by the ITC and MACRS depreciation, which could make it more difficult for customers to finance the purchase of our Energy Servers. Such circumstances could also require us to reduce the price at which we are able to sell our Energy Servers and therefore harm our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal Matters and Regulations\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building our manufacturing facilities.\nWe are subject to national, state, and local environmental laws and regulations as well as environmental laws in those foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and may often change. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury, fines, and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties or third-party damages. In addition, ensuring we are in compliance with applicable environmental laws could require significant time and management resources and could cause delays in our ability to build out, equip and operate our facilities as well as service our fleet, which would adversely impact our business, our prospects, our financial condition, and our operating results. In addition, environmental laws and regulations such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act in the United States impose liability on several grounds including for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination, for impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources. If contamination is discovered in the future at properties formerly owned or operated by us or currently owned or operated by us, or properties to which hazardous substances were sent by us, it could result in our liability under environmental laws and regulations. Many of our customers who purchase our Energy Servers have high sustainability standards, and any environmental noncompliance by us could harm our reputation and impact a current or potential customer\u2019s buying decision. The costs of complying with environmental laws, regulations, and customer requirements, and any claims concerning noncompliance or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our operating results.\nThe installation and operation of our Energy Servers are subject to environmental laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, and there is uncertainty with respect to the interpretation of certain environmental laws and regulations to our Energy Servers, especially as these regulations evolve over time.\nBloom is committed to compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations including health and safety standards, and we continually review the operation of our Energy Servers for health, safety, and environmental compliance. Our\nEnergy Servers, like other fuel cell technology-based products of which we are aware, produce small amounts of hazardous wastes and air pollutants, and we seek to ensure that they are handled in accordance with applicable regulatory standards.\nMaintaining compliance with laws and regulations can be challenging given the changing patchwork of environmental laws and regulations that prevail at the federal, state, regional, and local level. Most existing environmental laws and regulations preceded the introduction of our innovative fuel cell technology and were adopted to apply to technologies existing at the time, namely large coal, oil, or gas-fired power plants. Currently, there is generally little guidance from these agencies on how certain environmental laws and regulations may or may not be applied to our technology.\nFor example, natural gas, which is the primary fuel used in our Energy Servers, contains benzene, which is classified as a hazardous waste if it exceeds 0.5 milligrams (\"mg\") per liter. A small amount of benzene found in the public natural gas pipeline (equivalent to what is present in one gallon of gasoline in an automobile fuel tank which are exempt from federal regulation) is collected by the gas cleaning units contained in our Energy Servers which are typically replaced once every 18 to 24 months by us from customers\u2019 sites. From 2010 to late 2016 and in the regular course of maintenance of the Energy Servers, we periodically replaced the units in our servers under a federal environmental exemption that permitted the handling of such units without manifesting the contents as containing a hazardous waste. Although at the time we believed that we operated under the exemption with the approval of two states that had adopted the federal exemption, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") issued guidance for the first time in late 2016 that differed from our belief and conflicted with the state approvals we had obtained even though we had operated under the exemption since 2010. We have complied with the new guidance and, given the comparatively small quantities of benzene produced, we do not anticipate significant additional costs or risks from our compliance with the revised 2016 guidance. However, the EPA has asked us to show cause why it should not collect approximately $1.0 million in fines from us for the prior period, which we are contesting. Additionally, we paid a nominal fine to an agency in a different state under that state\u2019s environmental laws relating to the operation of our Energy Server under the exemption prior to the issuance of the revised EPA guidance.\nAnother example relates to the very small amounts of chromium in hexavalent form, or CR+6, which our Energy Servers emit at nanometer scale. This occurs any time a steel super alloy is exposed to high temperatures. CR+6 is found in small concentrations in the air generally. However, exposure to high or significant concentrations over prolonged periods of time can be carcinogenic. While the small amount of chromium emitted by our Energy Servers is initially in the hexavalent form, it converts to a non-toxic trivalent form, or CR+3, rapidly after it leaves the Energy Server. In tests we have conducted, air measurements taken 10 meters from an Energy Server show that the CR+6 is largely converted.\nOur Energy Servers do not present any significant health hazard based on our modeling, testing methodology, and measurements. There are several supporting elements to this position including that the emissions from our Energy Servers are in very low concentrations, are emitted as nano-particles that convert to the non-hazardous form CR+3 rapidly, are quickly dispersed into the air, and are not emitted in close proximity to locations where people would be expected to have a prolonged exposure. Nevertheless, we have engineered a technology solution that we are deploying.\nSeveral states in which we currently operate, including California, require permits for emissions of hazardous air pollutants based on the quantity of emissions, most of which require permits only for quantities of emissions that are higher than those observed from our Energy Servers. Other states in which we operate, including New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina, have specific exemptions for fuel cells. Some states in which we operate have CR+6 limits which are an order of magnitude over our operating range. Within California, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (\"BAAQMD\") requires a permit for emissions that are more than 0.00051 lbs/year. Other California regulations require that levels of CR+6 be below 0.00005 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, which is the level required by Proposition 65 and which requires notification of the presence of CR+6 unless it can be shown to be at levels that do not pose a significant health risk. We have determined that the standards applicable in California in this regard are more stringent than those in any other state or foreign location in which we have installed Energy Servers to date, therefore, deployment of our solution has been focused on California's standards.\nThere are generally no relevant environmental testing methodology guidelines for a technology such as ours. The standard test method for analyzing emissions cannot be readily applied to our Energy Servers because it would require inserting a probe into an emission stack. Our servers do not have emission stacks; therefore, we have to construct an artificial stack on top of our server in order to conduct a test. If we used the testing methodology similar to what the air districts have used in other large scale industrial products, it would show that we would need to reduce the emissions of CR+6 from our Energy Servers to meet the most stringent requirements. However, we employed a modified test method that is designed to capture the actual operating conditions of our Energy Servers and its distinctly different design from legacy power plants and industrial equipment. Based on our modeling, measured results and analysis, we believe we are in compliance with State of California air regulations. However, it is possible that the California Air Districts will require us to abate or shut down the operations of certain of our existing Energy Servers on a temporary basis or will seek the imposition of monetary fines.\nWhile we seek to comply with air quality and emission standards in every region in which we operate, it is possible that certain customers in other regions may request that we provide the new technology solution for their Energy Servers to comply with the stricter standards imposed by California even though they are not applicable and even though we are under no contractual obligation to do so. We plan to satisfy these requests from customers. Failure or delay in attaining regulatory approval could result in our not being able to operate in a particular local jurisdiction.\nThese examples illustrate that our technology is moving faster than the regulatory process in many instances. It is possible that regulators could delay or prevent us from conducting our business in some way pending agreement on, and compliance with, shifting regulatory requirements. Such actions could delay the installation of Energy Servers, could result in fines, could require modification or replacement or could trigger claims of performance warranties and defaults under customer contracts that could require us to repurchase their Energy Servers, any of which could adversely affect our business, our financial performance, and our reputation. In addition, new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could present marketing, political or regulatory challenges and could require us to upgrade or retrofit existing equipment, which could result in materially increased capital and operating expenses.\nFurthermore, we have not yet determined whether our Energy Servers will satisfy regulatory requirements in the other states in the U.S. and in international locations in which we do not currently sell Energy Servers but may pursue in the future.\nAs a fossil fuel-based technology, we may be subject to a heightened risk of regulation, to a potential for the loss of certain incentives, and to changes in our customers\u2019 energy procurement policies.\nAlthough the current generation of Bloom Energy Servers running on natural gas produce nearly 50% less carbon emissions compared to the average of U.S. combustion power generation, the operation of our Energy Servers does produce carbon dioxide (CO2), which has been shown to be a contributing factor to global climate change. As such, we may be negatively impacted by CO2-related changes in applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, or the requirements of the incentive programs on which we and our customers currently rely. Changes, or in some cases a lack of change, in any of the laws, regulations, ordinances, or rules that apply to our installations and new technology could make it illegal or more costly for us or our customers to install and operate our Energy Servers on particular sites, thereby negatively affecting our ability to deliver cost savings to customers, or we could be prohibited from completing new installations or continuing to operate existing projects. Certain municipalities have already banned the use of distributed generation products that utilize fossil fuel. Additionally, our customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 energy procurement policies may prohibit or limit their willingness to procure our Energy Servers. Our business prospects may be negatively impacted if we are prevented from completing new installations or our installations become more costly as a result of laws, regulations, ordinances, or rules applicable to our Energy Servers, or by our customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 energy procurement policies.\nExisting regulations and changes to such regulations impacting the electric power industry may create technical, regulatory, and economic barriers which could significantly reduce demand for our Energy Servers.\nThe market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign government regulations and policies as well as by internal policies and regulations of electric utility providers. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. These regulations and policies are often modified and could continue to change, which could result in a significant reduction in demand for our Energy Servers. For example, utility companies commonly charge fees to larger industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back-up purposes. These fees could change, thereby increasing the cost to our customers of using our Energy Servers and making them less economically attractive. In addition, our project with Delmarva Power & Light Company (\"Delmarva\") is subject to laws and regulations relating to electricity generation, transmission, and sale such as Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") regulation under various federal energy regulatory laws, which requires FERC authorization to make wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity, and ancillary services. Also, several of our PPA Entities are subject to regulation under FERC with respect to market-based sales of electricity, which requires us to file notices and make other periodic filings with FERC, which increases our costs and subjects us to additional regulatory oversight.\nAlthough we generally are not regulated as a utility, federal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, and the rules surrounding the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation for specific technologies. In the United States, governments frequently modify these statutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different requirements for utilities and rates for commercial customers on a regular basis. Changes, or in some cases a lack of change, in any of the laws, regulations, ordinances, or other rules that apply to our installations and new technology could make it more\ncostly for us or our customers to install and operate our Energy Servers on particular sites and, in turn, could negatively affect our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for the purchase of electricity.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.\nWe may in the future become subject to product liability claims. Our Energy Servers are considered high energy systems because they use flammable fuels and may operate at 480 volts. Although our Energy Servers are certified to meet ANSI, IEEE, ASME, and NFPA design and safety standards, if not properly handled in accordance with our servicing and handling standards and protocols, there could be a system failure and resulting liability. These claims could require us to incur significant costs to defend. Furthermore, any successful product liability claim could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our company and our Energy Servers, which could harm our brand, our business prospects, and our operating results. While we maintain product liability insurance, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage or outside of our coverage may have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.\nCurrent or future litigation or administrative proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nWe have been and continue to be involved in legal proceedings, administrative proceedings, claims, and other litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. Purchases of our products have also been the subject of litigation. For example, in 2011, an amendment to the Delaware Renewable Energy Portfolio Statute was enacted to permit the Delaware public service utility, Delmarva, to meet its renewable energy standards using energy generated by fuel cells manufactured and operated in Delaware. This statute required Delmarva to charge a tariff to its rate payers to pay for certain costs of providers of such energy generated by fuel cells. In 2012, plaintiffs FuelCell Energy Inc. and John A. Nichols filed suit against Delaware Governor Jack Markell and the Delaware Public Service Commission in the U.S. District Court for Delaware claiming that the 2011 amendment to the statute discriminated against interstate fuel cell providers and subsidized us for building a manufacturing facility in Delaware to manufacture fuel cells. We were not named as a party to this lawsuit and the litigation was ultimately settled. As another example, in July 2018, we received a Statement of Claim from two former executives of Advanced Equities, Inc. seeking to compel arbitration and alleging a breach of a confidential agreement from June 2014. This Statement of Claim sought, among other things, to void the indemnification and confidentiality provisions under the confidential agreement and to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The Statement of Claim was dismissed without prejudice on July 22, 2018. In addition, since our Energy Server is a new type of product in a nascent market, we have in the past needed and may in the future need to seek the amendment of existing regulations, or in some cases the creation of new regulations, in order to operate our business in some jurisdictions. Such regulatory processes may require public hearings concerning our business, which could expose us to subsequent litigation.\nUnfavorable outcomes or developments relating to proceedings to which we are a party or transactions involving our products such as judgments for monetary damages, injunctions, or denial or revocation of permits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations. In addition, settlement of claims could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly.\nAlthough we have taken many protective measures to protect our trade secrets including agreements, limited access, segregation of knowledge, password protections, and other measures, policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. For example, many of our engineers reside in California where it is not legally permissible to prevent them from working for a competitor if and when one should exist. Also, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation may result in our intellectual property rights being challenged, limited in scope, or declared invalid or unenforceable. We cannot be certain that the outcome of any litigation will be in our favor, and an adverse determination in any such litigation could impair our intellectual property rights, our business, our prospects, and our reputation.\nWe rely primarily on patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and non-disclosure, confidentiality, and other types of contractual restrictions to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights. However, our rights\nunder these laws and agreements afford us only limited protection and the actions we take to establish, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. For example, our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third parties, our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights adequately abroad.\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents, and our issued patents may not provide adequate protection, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.\nWe cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor. The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions, and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will result in patents being issued or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws, rules, and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued U.S. patents will be issued in other regions. Furthermore, even if these patent applications are accepted and the associated patents issued, some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the United States.\nIn addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, our prospects, and our operating results.\nWe may need to defend ourselves against claims that we infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others, which may be time-consuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCompanies, organizations, or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks, or other proprietary rights that they may in the future believe are infringed by our products or services. Although we are not currently subject to any claims related to intellectual property, these companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights allegedly relating to our technologies could, in the future, make claims or bring suits alleging infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of such rights, or otherwise assert their rights and by seeking licenses or injunctions. Several of the proprietary components used in our Energy Servers have been subjected to infringement challenges in the past. We also generally indemnify our customers against claims that the products we supply infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate third party intellectual property rights, and we therefore may be required to defend our customers against such claims. If a claim is successfully brought in the future and we or our products are determined to have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages (including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if our infringement is determined to be willful);\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n\u2022\nredesign our products or means of production, which may not be possible or cost-effective.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could harm our reputation, result in substantial costs and divert resources and management attention.\nWe also license technology from third parties and incorporate components supplied by third parties into our products. We may face claims that our use of such technology or components infringes or otherwise violates the rights of others, which would subject us to the risks described above. We may seek indemnification from our licensors or suppliers under our contracts with them, but our rights to indemnification or our suppliers\u2019 resources may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Operating Results\nWe have incurred significant losses in the past and we may not be profitable for the foreseeable future.\nSince our inception in 2001, we have incurred significant net losses and have used significant cash in our business. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.6 billion. We expect to continue to expand our operations, including by investing in manufacturing, sales and marketing, research and development, staffing systems, and infrastructure to support our growth. We anticipate that we will incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to achieve profitability in the future will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ngrowing our sales volume;\n\u2022\nincreasing sales to existing customers and attracting new customers;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining financing partners who are willing to provide financing for sales on a timely basis and with attractive terms;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to improve the useful life of our fuel cell technology and reducing our warranty servicing costs;\n\u2022\nreducing the cost of producing our Energy Servers;\n\u2022\nimproving the efficiency and predictability of our installation process;\n\u2022\nimproving the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining key talent in a competitive marketplace; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of stock based compensation recognized in the period.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future.\nOur financial condition and results of operations and other key metrics are likely to fluctuate on a quarterly basis in future periods, which could cause our results for a particular period to fall below expectations, resulting in a severe decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur financial condition and results of operations and other key metrics have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, the amount of product revenue we recognize in a given period is materially dependent on the volume of installations of our Energy Servers in that period and the type of financing used by the customer.\nIn addition to the other risks described herein, the following factors could also cause our financial condition and results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly basis:\n\u2022\nthe timing of installations, which may depend on many factors such as availability of inventory, product quality or performance issues, or local permitting requirements, utility requirements, environmental, health, and safety requirements, weather, and customer facility construction schedules;\n\u2022\nsize of particular installations and number of sites involved in any particular quarter;\n\u2022\nthe mix in the type of purchase or financing options used by customers in a period, and the rates of return required by financing parties in such period;\n\u2022\nwhether we are able to structure our sales agreements in a manner that would allow for the product and installation revenue to be recognized up front at acceptance;\n\u2022\ndelays or cancellations of Energy Server installations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our service costs, particularly due to unaccrued costs of servicing and maintaining Energy Servers;\n\u2022\nweaker than anticipated demand for our Energy Servers due to changes in government incentives and policies or due to other conditions;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our research and development expense, including periodic increases associated with the pre-production qualification of additional tools as we expand our production capacity;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in our supply chain;\n\u2022\nthe length of the sales and installation cycle for a particular customer;\n\u2022\nthe timing and level of additional purchases by existing customers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses or installation delays associated with changes in governmental regulations, permitting requirements by local authorities at particular sites, utility requirements and environmental, health, and safety requirements;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our sales, production, service or other business activities resulting from disagreements with our labor force or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in federal, state, local, or foreign government incentive programs available for us, our customers, and tax equity financing parties.\nFluctuations in our operating results and cash flow could, among other things, give rise to short-term liquidity issues. In addition, our revenue, key operating metrics, and other operating results in future quarters may fall short of the expectations of investors and financial analysts, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business and operating results may suffer.\nOur current growth and future growth plans may make it difficult for us to efficiently operate our business, challenging us to effectively manage our capital expenditures and control our costs while we expand our operations to increase our revenue. If we experience a significant growth in orders without improvements in automation and efficiency, we may need additional manufacturing capacity and we and some of our suppliers may need additional and capital intensive equipment. Any growth in manufacturing must include a scaling of quality control as the increase in production increases the possible impact of manufacturing defects. In addition, any growth in the volume of sales of our Energy Servers may outpace our ability to engage sufficient and experienced personnel to manage the higher number of installations and to engage contractors to complete installations on a timely basis and in accordance with our expectations and standards. Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, our prospects, our operating results, and our financial condition. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully.\nIf we discover a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and an accurate basis may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") requires, among other things, that public companies evaluate the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. As a recently public company and as an emerging growth company, we elected to delay adopting the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as is our option under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Although we did not discover any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2018, subsequent testing by us or our independent registered public accounting firm, which has not yet performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. To comply with Section 404A, we may incur substantial cost, expend significant management time on compliance-related issues, and hire additional accounting, financial, and internal audit staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404A in a timely manner or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. For further discussion on Section 404A compliance, see our Risk Factor: We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations that could subject our business to higher tax liability.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") will expire, if unused, beginning in 2022 and 2028, respectively. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Changes in our stock ownership as well as other changes that may be outside of our control could result in ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code, which could cause our NOLs to be subject to certain limitations. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. Our deferred tax assets, which are currently fully reserved with a valuation allowance, may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nRisks Relating to Our Liquidity\nWe must maintain customer confidence in our liquidity and long-term business prospects in order to grow our business.\nCurrently, we are the only provider able to fully support and maintain our Energy Servers. If potential customers believe we do not have sufficient capital or liquidity to operate our business over the long-term or that we will be unable to maintain their Energy Servers and provide satisfactory support, customers may be less likely to purchase or lease our products, particularly in light of the significant financial commitment required. In addition, financing sources may be unwilling to provide financing on reasonable terms. Similarly, suppliers, financing partners, and other third parties may be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they have concerns about the success of our business.\nAccordingly, in order to grow our business, we must maintain confidence in our liquidity and long-term business prospects among customers, suppliers, financing partners, and other parties. This may be particularly complicated by factors such as:\n\u2022\nour limited operating history at a large scale;\n\u2022\nour lack of profitability;\n\u2022\nunfamiliarity with or uncertainty about our Energy Servers and the overall perception of the distributed generation market;\n\u2022\nprices for electricity or natural gas in particular markets;\n\u2022\ncompetition from alternate sources of energy;\n\u2022\nwarranty or unanticipated service issues we may experience;\n\u2022\nthe environmental consciousness and perceived value of environmental programs to our customers;\n\u2022\nthe size of our expansion plans in comparison to our existing capital base and the scope and history of operations;\n\u2022\nthe availability and amount of tax incentives, credits, subsidies or other incentive programs; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nSeveral of these factors are largely outside our control, and any negative perceptions about our liquidity or long-term business prospects, even if unfounded, would likely harm our business.\nOur substantial indebtedness, and restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our, and our PPA Entities\u2019, outstanding indebtedness, may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $741.3 million of total consolidated indebtedness, of which an aggregate of $396.8 million represented indebtedness that is recourse to us. Of this $741.3 million debt, $34.7 million represented debt under our 5% Notes, $3.2 million represented operating debt, $344.5 million represented debt of our PPA Entities, $263.3 million represented debt under our 6% Notes and $95.6 million represented debt under our 10% Notes. The agreements governing our and our PPA Entities\u2019 outstanding indebtedness contain, and other future debt agreements may contain, covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on our business that limit our flexibility including, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nborrow money;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nmake asset dispositions;\n\u2022\nmake loans or investments;\n\u2022\nissue or sell share capital of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue guaranties;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes such as working capital and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy and comply with our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsubject us to increased sensitivity to interest rate increases;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions, or catastrophic external events;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to withstand competitive pressures;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to invest in new business subsidiaries that are not PPA Entity-related;\n\u2022\nreduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business, industry, and economic conditions; and/or\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have relatively less debt than we have.\nOur debt agreements and our PPA Entities\u2019 debt agreements require the maintenance of financial ratios or the satisfaction of financial tests such as debt service coverage ratios and consolidated leverage ratios. Our and our PPA Entities\u2019 ability to meet these financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these ratios and tests. Upon the occurrence of events such as a change in control of our company, significant asset sales or mergers or similar transactions, the liquidation or dissolution of our company or the cessation of our stock exchange listing, holders of our 6% Notes have the right to cause us to repurchase for cash any or all of such outstanding notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. We cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repurchase such notes. Furthermore, our financing and debt agreements, such as our 6% Notes and our 10% Notes, contain events of default. If an event of default were to occur, the trustee or the lenders could, among other things, terminate their commitments and declare outstanding amounts due and payable and our cash may become restricted. We cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance our indebtedness if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions may, as a result, be accelerated and become due and payable as a consequence. We may be unable to pay these debts in such circumstances. If we were unable to repay those amounts, lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. We cannot assure you that the collateral will be sufficient to repay in full those amounts. We cannot provide assurance that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in these agreements will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, or our ability to engage in other business activities that may be in our interest or our ability to react to adverse market developments.\nIf our PPA Entities default on their obligations under non-recourse financing agreements, we may decide to make payments to prevent such PPA Entities\u2019 creditors from foreclosing on the relevant collateral, as such a foreclosure would result in our losing our ownership interest in the PPA Entity or in some or all of its assets, or a material part of our assets, as the case may be. To satisfy these obligations, we may be required to use amounts distributed by our other PPA Entities as well as other sources of available cash, thereby reducing the cash available to develop our projects and to our operations. The loss of a material part of our assets or our ownership interest in one or more of our PPA Entities or some or all of their assets, or any use of our resources to support our obligations or the obligations of our PPA Entities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $741.3 million of total consolidated indebtedness, including $29.8 million in short-term debt and $711.4 million in long-term debt. In addition, our 10% Notes contain restrictions on our ability to issue additional debt and both the 6% Notes and 10% Notes limit our ability to provide collateral for any additional debt. Given our current level of indebtedness, the restrictions on additional indebtedness contained in the 10% Notes and the fact that most of our assets serve as collateral to secure existing debt, it may be difficult for us to secure additional debt financing at an attractive cost, which may in turn impact our ability to expand our operations and our product development activities and to remain competitive in the market.\nIn addition, our substantial level of indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain required additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes. Any of these risks could impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, our liquidity, and our results of operations. Our liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance, and many other factors not within our control.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive, and business factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nIn addition, we conduct a significant volume of our operations through, and receive equity allocations from, our PPA Entities, which contribute to our cash flow. These PPA Entities are separate and distinct legal entities, do not guarantee our debt obligations, and will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under our debt obligations or to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan, or other payments. Distributions by the PPA Entities to us are precluded under these arrangements if there is an event of default or if financial covenants, such as maintenance of applicable debt service coverage ratios, are not met even if there is not otherwise an event of default. Furthermore, under the terms of our equity financing arrangements for PPA Company II, PPA Company IIIa and PPA Company IIIb, substantially all of the cash flows generated from these PPA Entities in excess of debt service obligations are distributed to Equity Investors until the investors achieve a targeted internal rate of return or until a fixed date in the future (\"Flip Date\"), which is expected to be after a period of five or more years, after which time we will receive substantially all of the remaining income (loss), tax, and tax allocation attributable to the long-term customer payments and other incentives. In the case of PPA Company IV and PPA Company V, Equity Investors receive 90% of all cash flows generated in excess of its debt service obligations and other expenses for the duration of the applicable PPA Entity without any Flip Date or other time- or return-based adjustment. Moreover, even after the occurrence of the Flip Date for the PPA Entities, we do not anticipate distributions to be material enough independently to support our ongoing cash needs, and, therefore, we will still need to generate significant cash from our product sales. It is possible that the PPA Entities may not contribute significant cash to us even if we are in compliance with the financial covenants under the project debt incurred by the PPA Entities.\nFuture borrowings by our PPA Entities may contain restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends to us. The ability of our PPA Entities to make such payments to us may be subject to applicable laws including surplus, solvency, and other limits imposed on the ability of companies to pay dividends.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash to satisfy our debt obligations, including interest payments, or if we are unable to satisfy the requirement for the payment of principal at maturity or other payments that may be required from time to time under the terms of our debt instruments, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments, or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot provide assurance that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Furthermore, the ability to refinance indebtedness would depend upon the condition of the finance and credit markets at the time which have in the past been, and may in the future be, volatile. Our inability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis would have an adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nUnder some circumstances, we may be required to or elect to make additional payments to our PPA Entities or the Power Purchase Agreement Program Equity Investors.\nOur six PPA Entities are structured in a manner such that other than the amount of any equity investment we have made, we do not have any further primary liability for the debts or other obligations of the PPA Entities. However, we are required to guarantee the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiary which invests alongside other investors in the PPA Entities. These obligations typically include the capital contribution obligations of such subsidiary to the PPA Entity as well as the representations and warranties made by and indemnification obligations of such subsidiary to Equity Investors in the applicable PPA Entity. As a result, we may be obligated to make payments on behalf of our wholly-owned subsidiary to Equity Investors in the PPA Entities in the event of a breach of these representations, warranties or covenants.\nAll of our PPA Entities that operate Energy Servers for end customers have significant restrictions on their ability to incur increased operating costs, or could face events of default under debt or other investment agreements if end customers are not able to meet their payment obligations under PPAs or if Energy Servers are not deployed in accordance with the project\u2019s schedule. For example, under PPA Company IIIa\u2019s credit agreement, on or before February 19, 2019 PPA Company IIIa was obligated to offer its lenders an insurance policy or performance bond to mitigate the risk should we will fail to perform our obligations under our operation and maintenance obligations to PPA Company IIIa. Upon receipt of such offer, the lenders may elect to require PPA Company IIIa to obtain such insurance policy or performance bond, at PPA Company IIIa\u2019s expense, or elect to require PPA Company IIIa to prepay all remaining amounts owed under PPA Company IIIa\u2019s project debt. PPA Company IIIa has offered its lenders such an insurance policy and is awaiting the lenders\u2019 decision. If our PPA Entities\nexperience unexpected, increased costs such as insurance costs, interest expense or taxes or as a result of the acceleration of repayment of outstanding indebtedness, or if end customers are unable or unwilling to continue to purchase power under their PPAs, there could be insufficient cash generated from the project to meet the debt service obligations of the PPA Entity or to meet any targeted rates of return of Equity Investors. If a PPA Entity fails to make required debt service payments, this could constitute an event of default and entitle the lender to foreclose on the collateral securing the debt or could trigger other payment obligations of the PPA Entity. To avoid this, we could choose to contribute additional capital to the applicable PPA Entity to enable such PPA Entity to make payments to avoid an event of default, which could adversely affect our business or our financial condition. Additionally, under PPA Company II\u2019s credit agreement, PPA Company II is obligated to offer to repay all outstanding debt in the event that we obtain an investment grade credit rating unless we provide a guarantee of the debt obligations of the PPA Company II. Upon receipt of such offer, the lenders may elect to require PPA Company II to prepay all remaining amounts owed under PPA Company II\u2019s project debt. Under PPA Company IV\u2019s note purchase agreement, PPA Company IV is obligated to offer to repay all outstanding debt in the event that at any time we fail to own (directly or indirectly) at least 50.1% of the equity interest of PPA Company IV not owned by the Equity Investor(s). Upon receipt of such offer, the lenders may waive that obligation or elect to require PPA Company IV to prepay all remaining amounts owed under PPA Company IV\u2019s project debt. The obligations under PPA Company II and IV have not been triggered as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nWe may have conflicts of interest with our PPA Entities.\nIn each of our PPA Entities, we act as the managing member and are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the project. However, we are also a major service provider for each PPA Entity in its capacity as the operator of the Energy Servers under an operations and maintenance agreement. Because we are both the administrator and the manager of our PPA Entities, as well as a major service provider, we face a potential conflict of interest in that we may be obligated to enforce contractual rights that a PPA Entity has against us in our capacity as a service provider. By way of example, the PPA Entity may have a right to payment from us under a warranty provided under the applicable operations and maintenance agreement, and we may be financially motivated to avoid or delay this liability by failing to promptly enforce this right on behalf of the PPA Entity. While we do not believe that we had any conflicts of interest with our PPA Entities as of December 31, 2018, conflicts of interest may arise in the future which cannot be foreseen at this time. In the event that prospective future Equity Investors and debt financing partners perceive there to exist any such conflicts, it could harm our ability to procure financing for our PPA Entities in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical, engineering, and sales personnel, our ability to compete and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our success and our ability to reach our strategic objectives are highly dependent on the contributions of our key management, technical, engineering, and sales personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our products and services and negatively impact our business, prospects, and operating results. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Dr. Sridhar, our Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer, and other key employees. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Furthermore, there is increasing competition for talented individuals in our field, and competition for qualified personnel is especially intense in the San Francisco Bay Area where our principal offices are located. Our failure to attract and retain our executive officers and other key management, technical, engineering, and sales personnel could adversely impact our business, our prospects, our financial condition, and our operating results. In addition, we do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies covering any of our officers or other key employees.\nA breach or failure of our networks or computer or data management systems could damage our operations and our reputation.\nOur business is dependent on the security and efficacy of our networks and computer and data management systems. For example, all of our Energy Servers are connected to and controlled and monitored by our centralized remote monitoring service, and we rely on our internal computer networks for many of the systems we use to operate our business generally. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our infrastructure, including the network that connects our Energy Servers to our remote monitoring service, may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business and our Energy Servers in the field. A breach or failure of our networks or computer or data management systems due to intentional actions such as cyber-attacks, negligence, or other reasons could seriously disrupt our operations or could affect\nour ability to control or to assess the performance in the field of our Energy Servers and could result in disruption to our business and potentially legal liability. In addition, if certain of our IT systems failed, our production line might be affected, which could impact our business and operating results. These events, in addition to impacting our financial results, could result in significant costs or reputational consequences.\nOur headquarters and other facilities are located in an active earthquake zone, and an earthquake or other types of natural disasters or resource shortages could disrupt and harm our results of operations.\nWe conduct a majority of our operations in the San Francisco Bay area in an active earthquake zone, and certain of our facilities are located within known flood plains. The occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake, drought, flood, localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages could cause a significant interruption in our business, damage or destroy our facilities, our manufacturing equipment, or our inventory, and cause us to incur significant costs, any of which could harm our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations. The insurance we maintain against fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case.\nExpanding operations internationally could expose us to risks.\nAlthough we currently primarily operate in the United States, we will seek to expand our business internationally. We currently have operations in Japan, China, India, and the Republic of Korea. Managing any international expansion will require additional resources and controls including additional manufacturing and assembly facilities. Any expansion internationally could subject our business to risks associated with international operations, including:\n\u2022\nconformity with applicable business customs, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\nlack of availability of government incentives and subsidies;\n\u2022\nchallenges in arranging, and availability of, financing for our customers;\n\u2022\npotential changes to our established business model;\n\u2022\ncost of alternative power sources, which could be meaningfully lower outside the United States;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of natural gas;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations in an environment of diverse culture, laws, and customers, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u2022\ninstallation challenges which we have not encountered before which may require the development of a unique model for each country;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws, regulations, and permitting processes including environmental, banking, employment, tax, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations such as the EU Data Privacy Directive;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting payments in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ncompliance with potentially conflicting and changing laws of taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and compliance with applicable U.S. tax laws as they relate to international operations, the complexity and adverse consequences of such tax laws, and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in such tax laws; and\n\u2022\nregional economic and political conditions.\nAs a result of these risks, any potential future international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an emerging growth company (\"EGC\") as defined in the U.S. legislation Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\"), and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are\napplicable to other public companies that are not EGC, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these exemptions for so long as we are an EGC, which could be until December 31, 2023, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAn EGC may elect to provide financial statements in conformance with the U.S. GAAP requirement for transition periods to comply with new or revised accounting standards. With our not making this election, Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act allows us to delay our adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those standards apply to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company revised accounting standards effective dates.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe stock price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. In addition to factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations, subsidies, or credits or new interpretations of them applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity related to problems in our manufacturing or the real or perceived quality of our products;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nother events or factors including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements; and\n\u2022\nsales or anticipated sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market as and when our Class B common stock converts to Class A common stock. The perception that these sales might occur may also cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We had a total of\n20,868,286 shares of our Class A common stock and 88,552,897 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The lock up for our Class B shares expired on January 21, 2019 and these shares are now freely tradeable once converted into Class A shares, except for any shares purchased by our \u201caffiliates\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\").\nFurther, as of December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate of $296.2 million in convertible debt under which the outstanding principal and interest may be converted, at the option of the holders, into an aggregate of 26.3 million shares of Class B common stock. Upon conversion into Class A common stock, these shares are freely tradable, except to the extent these shares are held by our \u201caffiliates\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had options and RSUs outstanding that, if fully exercised or settled, would result in the issuance of 26,154,530 shares of Class B common stock. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable vesting requirements the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or settlement of outstanding RSUs will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nMoreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of such shares or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and the voting agreements among certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control of our Company with KR Sridhar, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and also with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our IPO including our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, which limits or precludes your ability to influence corporate matters including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction, and may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2018 and after giving effect to the voting agreements between KR Sridhar, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and certain holders of Class B common stock, our directors, executive officers, significant stockholders of our common stock, and their respective affiliates collectively held a substantial majority of the voting power of our capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earliest to occur of (i) immediately prior to the close of business on July 27, 2023, (ii) immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent less than five percent (5%) of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, (iii) the date and time or the occurrence of an event specified in a written conversion election delivered by KR Sridhar to our Secretary or Chairman of the Board to so convert all shares of Class B common stock, or (iv) immediately following the date of the death of KR Sridhar. This concentrated control limits or precludes Class A stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters while the dual class structure remains in effect, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that Class A stockholders may feel are in their best interest as one of our stockholders.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those remaining holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term.\nThe conversion of the 6% Convertible Promissory Note could result in a significant stockholder with substantial voting control.\nThe holders of the 6% Convertible Promissory Notes have the options to convert the outstanding principal and interest under the 6% Convertible Promissory Note to Class B common stock at conversion price of $11.25 at any time after the IPO and prior to maturity of the 6% Convertible Promissory Note in December 2020. As of December 31, 2018, an aggregate of 21,321,100 shares of Class B common stock is issuable to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (\u201cCPPIB\u201d) upon the conversion of the outstanding principal and interest under the 6% Convertible Promissory Note. This, along with 312,575 shares of Class B common stock CPPIB which CPPIB acquired from the exercise of a warrant at IPO, would result in CPPIB having approximately 23.5% of the total voting power with respect to all shares of our Class A and Class B common stock,\nvoting as a single class and would provide CPPIB significant influence over matters presented to the stockholders for approval and may result in voting decisions by CPPIB which are not in the best interests of our stockholders generally.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock.\nS&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have recently announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500, namely, to exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to such indices. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices and may cause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by shareholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe market price for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our Class A common stock would be negatively affected. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, may limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, and may limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nour board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three year terms;\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\nonly the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which thereby requires all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock may have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or substantially all of its assets;\n\u2022\nthe board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which thereby may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, our operating results, and our financial condition.\nOn December 19, 2018, the Delaware Chancery Court issued an opinion that invalidated provisions in a Delaware corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that purport to limit to federal court the forum in which a stockholder could bring a claim under the Securities Act. The Chancery Court held that a Delaware corporation can only use its constitutive documents to bind a plaintiff to a particular forum where the claim involves rights or relationships established by or under Delaware\u2019s corporate law. This case may be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17949, "SIC": 3621, "TIC": "BE"}
