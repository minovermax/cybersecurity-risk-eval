{"cik": "1400810", "company": "HCI Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including those described below, which could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity and, additionally, could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period.\nAlthough we plan to enter the insurance market in other states, our insurance business is currently in Florida only. Thus, any single catastrophic event or other condition affecting losses in Florida could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA single catastrophic event, a destructive weather pattern, a general economic trend, regulatory developments or other conditions specifically affecting the state of Florida could have a disproportionately adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we actively manage our exposure to catastrophic events through our underwriting process and the purchase of reinsurance, the fact that our business is concentrated in the state of Florida subjects it to increased exposure to certain catastrophic events and destructive weather patterns such as hurricanes, tropical storms, and tornados. Changes in the prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, political, demographic and competitive environment, and other conditions in the state of Florida could also make it less attractive for us to do business in Florida and would have a more pronounced effect on our business than it would on other insurance companies that are geographically diversified. Since our business is concentrated in this manner, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events or other conditions affecting losses in the state of Florida could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur results may fluctuate based on many factors including cyclical changes in the insurance industry.\nThe insurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted an increase in pricing and, thus, more favorable underwriting profits. As premium levels increase, there may be new entrants to the market, which could then lead to a decrease in premium levels. Any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer opportunities to underwrite insurance risks, which could\nhave a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance business significantly.\nWe cannot predict whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot write insurance at appropriate rates, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur operations are highly dependent on the efforts of our senior executive officers, particularly our chief executive officer, Paresh Patel, as well as our chief financial officer, Richard Allen, and HCPCI\u2019s president, Scott Wallace. The loss of their leadership, industry knowledge and experience could negatively impact our operations. However, we have management succession plans to lessen any such negative impact. With the exception of Mr. Patel, Mr. Allen and Mr. Wallace, we have no employment agreements with any of our personnel nor do we offer any guarantee of any employee\u2019s ongoing service. We maintain key-man life insurance on Mr. Patel although such policy may be insufficient to cover us for the damage resulting to our company from the loss of Mr. Patel\u2019s services.\nOur information technology systems may fail or suffer a loss of security, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur insurance business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer and data processing systems. We rely on these systems to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for writing business, as well as to handle our policy administration process (i.e., the printing and mailing of our policies, endorsements, renewal notices, etc.). The successful operation of our systems depends on a continuous supply of electricity. The failure of these systems or disruption in the supply of electricity could interrupt our operations and result in a material, adverse effect on our business.\nThe development and expansion of our insurance business is dependent upon the successful development and implementation of advanced computer and data processing systems. Because HCPCI intends to expand its writing of voluntary policies, we are enhancing our information technology systems to handle and process an increased volume of voluntary policies. The failure of these systems to function as planned could slow our growth and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations.\nIn addition, a security breach of our computer systems could damage our reputation or result in liability. We retain confidential business and policyholder information in our computer systems. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. It is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure. Despite the implementation of security measures, this infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. In addition, we could be subject to liability if hackers were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate confidential information.\nWe conduct our business primarily from offices located in Tampa, Florida where tropical storms could damage our facilities or interrupt our power supply. The loss or significant impairment of functionality in these facilities for any reason could have a material, adverse effect on our business although we believe we have sufficient redundancies to replace our facilities if functionality is impaired. We contract with a third party vendor to maintain complete daily backups of our systems, which are stored at the vendor\u2019s facility in Atlanta, Georgia. Access to these databases is strictly controlled and limited to authorized personnel. In the event of a disaster causing a complete loss of functionality at our Tampa location, we plan to use temporarily the secondary office in Ocala, Florida to continue our operations.\nIncreased competition, competitive pressures, industry developments, and market conditions could affect the growth of our business and adversely impact our financial results.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry in Florida is cyclical and highly competitive. We compete not only with other stock companies but also with mutual companies, other underwriting organizations and alternative risk sharing mechanisms. Our principal lines of business are written by numerous other insurance companies. Competition for any one account may come from very large, well-established national companies, smaller regional companies, other specialty insurers in our field, and new entrants to the Florida market. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources, larger agency networks and greater name recognition than our company. We compete for business not only on the basis of price, but also on the basis of financial strength, types of coverage offered, availability of coverage desired by customers, commission structure, and quality of service. We may have difficulty continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. Competitive pressures coupled with market conditions may affect our rate of premium growth and financial results.\nOur ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance industry and our ability to expand our business may be negatively affected by the fact that we are not a long-established company. HCPCI has obtained a Demotech rating of \u201cA Exceptional,\u201d which is accepted by major mortgage companies operating in the state of Florida and many other states. Mortgage companies may require homeowners to obtain property insurance from an insurance company with an acceptable A.M. Best rating. Such a requirement could prevent us from expanding our business, which may in turn limit our ability to compete with large, national insurance companies and certain regional insurance companies. We currently do not have an A.M. Best rating but may seek to obtain such a rating. A downgrade or loss of our Demotech rating could result in a substantial loss of business in the event insureds move their business to insurers with a sufficient financial strength rating.\nThere are inherent limitations and risks related to our projections and our estimates of claims and loss reserves. If our actual losses exceed our loss reserves, our financial results, our ability to expand our business, and our ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance industry may be negatively affected. In addition, industry developments could further increase competition in our industry. These developments could include -\n\u2022\nan influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their businesses and new companies attempt to enter the insurance business as a result of better pricing and/or terms;\n\u2022\nnew programs or changes to existing programs in which federally or state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in Florida or any other states\u2019 regulatory climate; and\n\u2022\nthe enactment of federal proposals for an optional federal charter that would allow some competing insurers to operate under regulations different or less stringent than those applicable to our insurance subsidiaries.\nThese developments and others could make the property and casualty insurance marketplace more competitive by increasing the supply of insurance available.\nIf competition limits our ability to write new business at adequate rates, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf our actual losses from claims exceed our loss reserves, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nOur objective is to establish loss reserves that are adequate and represent management\u2019s best estimate; that is, the amounts initially recorded as reserves should approximate the ultimate cost to investigate and settle a specific claim. However, the process of establishing adequate reserves is complex and inherently uncertain, and the ultimate cost of a claim may vary materially from the amounts reserved. We regularly monitor and evaluate loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development to determine reserve adequacy.\nDue to these uncertainties, the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves which could have a material, adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to pay claims accurately could adversely affect our insurance business, financial results and capital requirements.\nWe rely on our claims personnel to accurately evaluate and pay the claims made under our policies. Many factors could affect our ability to accurately evaluate and pay claims, including the accuracy of our external independent adjusters as they make their assessments and submit their estimates of damages; the training, background, and experience of our claims representatives; the ability of our claims personnel to ensure consistent claims handling given the input by our external\nindependent adjusters; the ability of our claims department to translate the information provided by our external independent adjusters into acceptable claims settlements; and the ability of our claims personnel to maintain and update our claims handling procedures and systems as they evolve over time based on claims and geographical trends in claims reporting. Any failure to pay claims accurately could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our corporate image and negatively affect our financial results.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued and renewed, and our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to expand our business because our capital must be used to pay greater than anticipated claims, our financial results may suffer.\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to expand the number of insurance policies we write, to expand the kinds of insurance products we offer, and to expand the geographic markets in which we do business, all balanced by the insurance risks we choose to assume and cede. Our existing sources of funds include possible sales of our securities and our income from operations and investments. Unexpected catastrophic events in our market areas, such as hurricanes, may result in greater claims losses than anticipated, which could require us to limit or halt our growth while we redeploy our capital to pay these unanticipated claims unless we are able to raise additional capital.\nHCI Group, Inc. depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate and transfer funds to meet its debt obligations.\nHCI Group, Inc. does not have significant revenue generating operations of its own. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries. If the funds we receive from our subsidiaries are insufficient to meet our debt obligations, we may be required to raise funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, reduce or suspend dividend payments, or sell assets.\nWe may require additional capital in the future which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. To the extent that our present capital is insufficient to meet future operating requirements or to cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth. Based on our current operating plan, we believe current capital together with our anticipated retained income will support our operations. However, we cannot provide any assurance in that regard, since many factors will affect our capital needs and their amount and timing, including our growth and profitability, and the availability of reinsurance, as well as possible acquisition opportunities, market disruptions and other unforeseeable developments. If we require additional capital, it is possible that equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms unfavorable to us. Equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of existing shareholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected.\nLimited markets for and restrictions on certain holdings in our investment portfolio.\nCertain holdings in our investment portfolio include limited partnership interests, a construction loan (which is referred to herein as the ADC Arrangement) and one real estate joint venture. We also plan to increase our holdings in these types of investments in the near future. These investments may be illiquid in the near term as they are privately placed and are subject to certain restrictions or conditions that may limit our ability to immediately dispose of the investment. If it becomes necessary to sell any of these investments at a time when the fair market value is below our carrying value, we may incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and financial position.\nOur financial results may be negatively affected by the fact that a portion of our income is generated by the investment of our available cash.\nA portion of our income is, and likely will continue to be, generated by the investment of our available cash. The amount of income so generated is a function of our investment policy, available investment opportunities, and the amount of available cash invested. We may alter our investment policy to accept higher levels of risk with the expectation of higher returns. Fluctuating interest rates and other economic factors make it impossible to estimate accurately the amount of investment income that will be realized. In fact, we may realize losses on our investments.\nReinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all and we risk non-collectability of reinsurance amounts due us from reinsurers with which we have contracted.\nReinsurance is a method of transferring part of an insurance company\u2019s liability and premium under an insurance policy to another insurance company, or reinsurer. We use reinsurance arrangements to limit and manage the amount of risk we retain, to stabilize our underwriting results and to increase our underwriting capacity. The cost of such reinsurance is subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control, such as the amount of capital in the reinsurance market and natural and man-made catastrophes. We cannot be assured that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us in the amounts we consider sufficient and at prices acceptable to us. As a result, we may determine to increase the amount of risk we retain or look for other alternatives to reinsurance, which could in turn have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWith respect to the reinsurance treaties we currently have in effect, our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers is subject to the reinsurance company\u2019s ability and willingness to pay and to meet their obligations to us. We attempt to select financially strong reinsurers with an A.M. Best rating of \u201cA-\u201d or better or we require the reinsurer to fully collateralize its exposure. While we monitor from time to time their financial condition, we rely principally on A.M. Best, our reinsurance broker, and other rating agencies in determining their ability to meet their obligations to us. Any failure on the part of any one reinsurance company to meet its obligations to us could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have exposure to unpredictable catastrophes, which can materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe write insurance policies that cover homeowners, condominium owners, and tenants for losses that result from, among other things, catastrophes. We are therefore subject to losses, including claims under policies we have written, arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A significant catastrophe could also have an adverse effect on our reinsurers. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, power outages, fires and man-made events. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Our policyholders are currently concentrated in Florida, which is especially subject to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms. Therefore, although we attempt to manage our exposure to catastrophes through our underwriting process and the purchase of reinsurance protection, an especially severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes could exceed our reinsurance protection and may have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIndustry trends, such as increased litigation against the insurance industry and individual insurers, the willingness of courts to expand covered causes of loss, rising jury awards, and the escalation of loss severity may contribute to increased costs and to the deterioration of the reserves of our insurance subsidiary.\nLoss severity in the property and casualty insurance industry may increase and may be driven by larger court judgments. In the event legal actions and proceedings are brought on behalf of classes of complainants, this may increase the size of judgments. The propensity of policyholders and third party claimants to litigate and the willingness of courts to expand causes of loss and the size of awards may render our loss reserves inadequate for current and future losses.\nThe failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe utilize a number of strategies to mitigate risk exposure within our insurance business, which include:\n\u2022\nengaging in vigorous underwriting;\n\u2022\ncarefully evaluating terms and conditions of our policies;\n\u2022\nfocusing on our risk aggregations by geographic zones and other bases; and\n\u2022\nceding insurance risk to reinsurance companies.\nHowever, there are inherent limitations in all of these tactics. We cannot provide assurance that an event or series of unanticipated events will not result in loss levels which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations.\nOur insurance underwriting process is generally designed to limit our exposure to known and manageable risks. Various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, which have been negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend.\nIn addition, the policies we issue contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. While our insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the loss exposure to us and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect our loss experience, which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the future, we may rely on independent agents to write our insurance policies, and if we are not able to contract with and retain independent agents, our revenues would be negatively affected.\nAlthough voluntary policies comprise a small percentage of our business, we expect to increase the number of voluntary policies we write as our business expands. An inability to sell our products through independent agents would negatively affect our revenues.\nWe must compete with other insurers for independent agents\u2019 business. Our competitors may offer a greater variety of insurance products, lower premiums for insurance coverage, or higher commissions to their agents. If our products, pricing and commissions do not remain competitive, we may find it more difficult to attract business from independent agents to sell our products. A material reduction in the amount of our products that independent agents sell could negatively affect our revenues.\nOur success depends on our ability to accurately price the risks we underwrite.\nThe results of our operations and our financial condition depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks, including risks associated with new product offerings. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully, and as a result price our products accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including -\n\u2022\nthe availability of sufficient reliable data;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022\nour selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques;\n\u2022\nchanges in legal standards, claim settlement practices, and restoration costs; and\n\u2022\nlegislatively imposed consumer initiatives.\nIn addition, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our profit margins. We could also overprice risks, which could reduce our retention, sales volume and competitiveness. In any event, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nUse of current operating resources may be necessary to develop future new insurance products.\nWe may expand our product offerings by underwriting additional insurance products and programs. Claddaugh may offer reinsurance products to unaffiliated insurance companies. Expansion of our product offerings will result in increases in expenses due to additional costs incurred in actuarial rate justifications, software and personnel. Offering additional insurance products will also require regulatory approval, further increasing our costs and potentially affecting the speed with which we will be able to pursue new market opportunities. We cannot assure you that we will be successful bringing new insurance products to markets.\nUse of current operating resources may be necessary to expand our insurance business geographically.\nAlthough we currently conduct our homeowners\u2019 insurance business in Florida, we plan to enter the homeowners\u2019 insurance markets in other states. Geographic expansion of our insurance business will result in increases in expenses due to additional costs incurred in actuarial rate justifications, software, personnel and regulatory compliance. Although we plan to enter other states judiciously with attention to profitability, we cannot assure you that our entry into other states will be successful.\nAs an insurance holding company, we are currently subject to state regulation and in the future may become subject to federal regulation.\nAll states regulate insurance holding company systems. State statutes and administrative rules generally require each insurance company in the holding company group to register with the department of insurance in its state of domicile and to furnish information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the group. As part of its registration, each insurance company must identify material agreements, relationships and transactions with affiliates, including without limitation, loans, investments, asset transfers, transactions outside of the ordinary course of business, certain management, service, and cost sharing agreements, reinsurance transactions, dividends, and consolidated tax allocation agreements.\nInsurance holding company regulations generally provide that transactions between an insurance company and its affiliates must be fair and equitable, allocated between the parties in accordance with customary accounting practices, and fully disclosed in the records of the respective parties. Many types of transactions between an insurance company and its affiliates, such as transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the system may be subject to prior approval by, or prior notice to, state regulatory authorities. If we are unable to obtain the requisite prior approval for a specific transaction, we would be precluded from taking the action, which could adversely affect our operations. In addition, state insurance regulations also frequently impose notice or approval requirements for the acquisition of specified levels of ownership in the insurance company or insurance holding company.\nHCPCI is approved as an admitted carrier in Florida and as a non-admitted carrier in Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Virginia. In addition, our Alabama subsidiary is approved as an admitted carrier to write insurance products in Alabama. We may in the future seek authorization to transact business in other states as well. We will therefore become subject to the laws and regulatory requirements of those states. These regulations may vary from state to state, and states occasionally may have conflicting regulations. Currently, the federal government\u2019s role in regulating or dictating the policies of insurance companies is limited. However, Congress, from time to time, considers proposals that would increase the role of the federal government in insurance regulation, either in addition to or in lieu of state regulation. The impact of any future federal insurance regulation on our insurance operations is unclear and may adversely impact our business or competitive position.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, which may reduce our profitability or limit our growth. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe insurance industry is highly regulated and supervised. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they transact insurance business. Such supervision and regulation is primarily designed to protect our policyholders rather than our shareholders. These regulations are generally administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things -\n\u2022\nthe content and timing of required notices and other policyholder information;\n\u2022\nthe amount of premiums the insurer may write in relation to its surplus;\n\u2022\nthe amount and nature of reinsurance a company is required to purchase;\n\u2022\nparticipation in guaranty funds and other statutorily created markets or organizations;\n\u2022\nbusiness operations and claims practices;\n\u2022\napproval of policy forms and premium rates;\n\u2022\nstandards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;\n\u2022\nlicensing of insurers and their products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to insurance holding companies;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;\n\u2022\nrequiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring certain methods of accounting;\n\u2022\nperiodic examinations of our operations and finances;\n\u2022\nthe form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and\n\u2022\nthe level of reserves.\nThe FLOIR and regulators in other jurisdictions where we may become licensed and offer insurance products conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. These regulatory authorities also conduct periodic examinations into insurers\u2019 business practices. These reviews may reveal deficiencies in our insurance operations or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.\nHCPCI is subject to assessments levied by the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association, Inc. While we can recover these assessments from policyholders through policy surcharges, our payment of the assessments and our recoveries may not offset each other in the same reporting period in our financial statements and may cause a material, adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular reporting period.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nFinally, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nOur real estate operations include owning marina operations, which are subject to regulation under various federal, state, and local laws concerning the environment.\nOur marina operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, and local laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws relating to our marina operations.\nOur real estate operations include owning restaurant operations, which expose us to additional risks, which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nOur restaurant operations expose us to unique business risks. For example, restaurant operations are dependent in large part on food, beverage, and supply costs that are not within our control. Also, the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns that could adversely affect revenues from restaurant operations. Moreover, the restaurant industry is affected by litigation and publicity concerning food quality, health, and other issues which can cause guests to avoid restaurants and that can result in liabilities. Any one of these risks, among others, could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations in India expose us to additional risks, which could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur India operations expose us to additional risks including currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks related to other challenges caused by distance, language, and compliance with Indian labor laws and other complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our India operations. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, or criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees. Although policies and procedures are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nUnintended consequences of the anti-takeover provisions of our shareholder rights agreement.\nOur shareholder rights agreement is intended to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics and to protect our shareholders\u2019 interests by encouraging anyone seeking control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors. However, these rights may discourage, delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt, including offers or attempts that could be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, the rights agreement may deter investors from participating in any future equity offerings we propose.", "PERMNO": 92780, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "HCI"}
