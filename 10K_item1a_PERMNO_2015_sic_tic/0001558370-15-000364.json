RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following adverse developments described in the following risk factors could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisk Related to Our Business and the Development, Regulatory Approval, and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe will need substantial additional capital to develop and commercialize our product candidates, and we may be unable to raise additional capital when needed, or at all, which would force us to reduce or discontinue operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $40.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. We utilized $35.9 million of cash in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur spending levels vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities. As a result, our cash used in operating activities will also fluctuate from period to period. We have not sold and do not expect to sell any product candidates or derive royalty revenue from product candidate sales for the foreseeable future, if ever. In order to develop and bring product candidates through approval for marketing, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming clinical trials. As such, we anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, primarily to advance our lead program, KB004, in clinical trials. The amount of capital we will require and the timing of our need for additional capital will depend on many other factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe type, number, costs, and results of the product candidate development programs which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, expansion, costs, and results of, or delays in, our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain development partnering arrangements and any associated funding;\n\u00b7\nthe timing, receipt and amount of contingent, royalty, and other payments from any future development partners;\n\u00b7\nthe emergence of competing products or technologies and other adverse market developments;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of maintaining, expanding, and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe sourcing, timing, scope, progress, expansion, and costs of manufacturing our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of repayment of current loans, and our ability to draw funds from any future loan and security agreement; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with being a public company.\nSince our inception, we have been financing our operations primarily through private placements and our initial and secondary public offerings of our equity securities, interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, borrowings from lines of credit, and payments under agreements with Sanofi and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. (together with its affiliates, Novartis), a licensee of our Humaneered\u00ae technology. Our future capital requirements are substantial and in order to fund our future needs, we may seek additional funding through equity or debt financings, development partnering arrangements, borrowings from lines of credit, or other sources. In order to maintain adequate capital to fund the continued development of our product candidates, management continues to evaluate a number of alternatives, including but not limited to: (i) seeking additional partner(s) for our programs to provide capital for future development and to share in development costs, (ii) undertaking reductions in operating spending, and (iii) evaluating various means to raise additional capital, such as debt or equity offerings. Regardless of any actions we take to address our cash position in the near term, we will also need to raise additional capital in order to further advance our product candidates towards regulatory approval. If management is unsuccessful in these efforts, based on our current levels of operating spending our current capital may not be sufficient in some scenarios to fund our operations for the next twelve months. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any failure to raise capital could be deemed a material adverse change under our loan and security agreement with MidCap Financial and that may, in turn, result in the lender declaring the loan in default and demanding repayment of the principal, accrued interest, the exit fee and a prepayment fee. These conditions could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of this Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur expectations are based on management\u2019s current assumptions and clinical development plans, which may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. We will require substantial additional capital to support clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and, if approved, the commercialization of our product candidates. Additional funding may not be available to us on a timely basis or at acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to others our technologies, product candidates, or development programs that we would have preferred to develop and commercialize ourselves on less than favorable terms, if at all.\nWe have a history of operating losses, we expect to continue to incur losses, and we may never become profitable.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $178.2 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred a net loss of $38.0 million. We have incurred net losses each year since our inception except for the year ended December 31, 2007. To date, we have only recognized revenue from payments for funded research and development and for license or collaboration fees. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur additional operating losses in the future to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our accumulated deficit is expected to increase significantly as we continue our development and clinical trial efforts. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and successfully commercializing our product candidates, either alone or with third parties. We do not currently have the required approvals to market any of our product candidates and we may never receive them. We may not be profitable even if we or any of our future development partners succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our product candidates, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nOur product candidates are at an early stage of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized. We have had to discontinue the development of prior product candidates.\nOur product candidates are in the early stage of development and will require substantial clinical development, testing, and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We currently only have one product candidate in Phase 2 clinical trials, KB004, and we have recently discontinued development of KB001-A in CF patients with Pa lung infections and KB003 in severe asthma. None of our product candidates have advanced into a pivotal study and it may be years before such a study is initiated, if at all. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA regulatory approval process and are commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our development programs, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized. If we or any of our future development partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for or, if approved, successfully commercialize, one or more of our product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining additional development partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nWe have recently announced our mutual agreement with Sanofi to terminate our prior development partnership for KB001-A. In addition to our prior partnership with Sanofi, a part of our strategy is to enter into development partnerships in the future, including collaborations with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate development partners and the negotiation process is time consuming and complex. Although our decision with Sanofi was mutual, we cannot predict the impact of that decision on the likelihood of our ability to enter into future partnerships for KB001-A or for our other programs. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a development partnership or other alternative arrangements for any of our other existing or future product candidates and programs because, among other reasons, our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early a stage of development for collaborative effort and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish new development partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us and we may not be able to maintain such development partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product candidate are disappointing. Any delay in entering into new development partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness if they reach the market.\nMoreover, if we fail to establish and maintain additional development partnerships related to our product candidates:\n\u00b7\nthe development of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed;\n\u00b7\nour cash expenditures related to development of certain of our current or future product candidates would increase significantly and we may need to seek additional financing;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted; and\n\u00b7\nwe will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates.\nOur loan and security agreement contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nIn September 2012, we entered into a loan and security agreement with MidCap Financial and drew down $5.0 million under the facility. In December 2012, we drew down an additional $5.0 million under the facility, and in May 2014, we drew down the final $5.0 million available under the facility. The agreement contains various covenants that\nlimit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur or assume certain debt;\n\u00b7\nmerge or consolidate;\n\u00b7\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u00b7\nchange our organizational structure or type;\n\u00b7\ndispose of certain assets;\n\u00b7\ngrant liens on our assets;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments;\n\u00b7\npay dividends; and\n\u00b7\nenter into material transactions with affiliates.\nA breach of any of these covenants or a material adverse change to our business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) could result in a default under the loan. A material adverse change means a material impairment in the perfection or priority of the lender\u2019s lien in the collateral or in the value of the collateral; a material adverse change in the business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company, taken as a whole; or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of the obligations. In the case of a continuing event of default under the loan, MidCap Financial could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, commence and prosecute bankruptcy and/or other insolvency proceedings, or proceed against the collateral granted to MidCap Financial under the loan. Amounts outstanding under the term loan are secured by all of our existing and future assets (excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge arrangement). A default and any accompanying repayment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBecause we have a short operating history developing clinical-stage antibodies, there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our product candidates and business prospects.\nWe commenced our first clinical trial in 2006, and we have a limited operating history developing clinical-stage antibodies upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, as an early-stage clinical development company, we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials, and we have never conducted clinical trials of a size required for regulatory approvals. Further, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan we will need to successfully:\n\u00b7\nexecute our product candidate development activities, including successfully completing our clinical trial programs;\n\u00b7\nobtain required regulatory approvals for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nmanage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to clinical trials, regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercialization;\n\u00b7\nsecure substantial additional funding;\n\u00b7\ndevelop and maintain successful strategic relationships;\n\u00b7\nbuild and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio;\n\u00b7\nbuild and maintain appropriate clinical, sales, distribution, and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties; and\n\u00b7\ngain market acceptance and favorable reimbursement status for our product candidates.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop product candidates, raise capital, expand our business, or continue our operations.\nWe have and may continue to experience delays in commencing or conducting our clinical trials, in receiving data from third parties or in the continuation or completion of clinical testing, which could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate product candidate revenue.\nBefore we can initiate clinical trials in the United States for any new product candidates, we are required to submit the results of preclinical testing to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, along with other information including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and our proposed clinical trial protocol. In doing so, we rely in part on preclinical, clinical, and quality data previously generated by other third parties for regulatory submissions. In addition, for our programs already underway, we are required to report or provide information to appropriate regulatory authorities in order to continue with our testing programs. If we are unable to make timely regulatory submissions for any of our programs, it will delay our plans for our clinical trials. If those third parties do not make the required data available to us, we will likely have to identify and contract with another CMO, and/or develop all necessary preclinical and clinical data on our own, which will lead to significant delays and increase development costs of the product candidate. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical testing for any product candidate before it allows us to initiate clinical testing under any IND, which may lead to additional delays and increase the costs of our preclinical development. Moreover, despite the presence of an active IND for a product candidate, clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:\n\u00b7\nidentifying, recruiting, and enrolling qualified subjects to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nidentifying, recruiting, and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u00b7\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time to time, and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\nobtaining and maintaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials, either as a result of transferring the manufacturing of a product candidate to another site or manufacturer, deferring ordering or production of product in order to conserve resources or mitigate risk, having product in inventory become no longer suitable for use in humans, or other reasons that reduce or delay availability of drug supply;\n\u00b7\nobtaining and maintaining institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at an existing or prospective site;\n\u00b7\nretaining or replacing participants who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process, or personal issues; readiness of any companion diagnostic necessary to ensure that the study enrolls the target population; or\n\u00b7\nundergoing a clinical trial put on clinical hold at any time by the FDA during product candidate development.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, recruitment and enrollment of subjects may be slower than we anticipate. Numerous companies and institutions are conducting clinical studies in similar patient populations which can result in competition for qualified patients. In addition, clinical trials will take longer than we anticipate if we are required, or\nbelieve it is necessary, to enroll additional subjects. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, an Institutional Review Board (IRB), an ethics committee, or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site or the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u00b7\ninspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\ninability to provide timely supply of drug product;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen safety issues, known safety issues that occur at a greater frequency or severity than we anticipate, or any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; or\n\u00b7\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nAdditionally, if any of our future development partners do not develop the licensed product candidates in the time and manner that we expect, or at all, the clinical development efforts related to these licensed product candidates could be delayed or terminated. In addition, our ability to enforce our partners\u2019 obligations under any future collaboration efforts may be limited due to time and resource constraints, competing corporate priorities of our future partners, and other factors.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials may delay or preclude our ability to further develop or pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates. Changes in U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may affect the costs, timing, and likelihood of a successful completion of a clinical trial. If we or any of our future development partners experience delays in the completion of, or if we or any of our future development partners must terminate, any clinical trial of any product candidate our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer as a result. In addition, many of these factors may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, compliance with which is costly and time consuming, may cause unanticipated delays, or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, approval, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing, and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval from the FDA. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications. Approval policies or regulations may change and the FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.\nThe FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our or any of our future development partners\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe or any of our future development partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe results of clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by such authorities for approval;\n\u00b7\nwe or any of our future development partners may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials or the use of results from antibody studies that served as precursors to our current drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or any of our future development partners contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be successful in developing any companion diagnostic necessary to demonstrate efficacy in our desired target populations for KB004;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may delay approval or clearance of any companion diagnostic for KB004; or\n\u00b7\nthe approval policies or regulations of such authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our or any of our future development partners\u2019 clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary widely among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods, and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased caution by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us, or any of our future development partners from commercializing our product candidates.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results. Any product candidate we or any of our future development partners advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\nDrug development has substantial inherent risk. We or any of our future development partners will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials. In addition, success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Furthermore, our future trials will need to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy for approval by regulatory authorities in larger patient populations. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. In addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) or BLA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nFor example, we recently announced the termination of development in Pa lung infections in CF patients of KB001-A, our most advanced product candidate, because the Phase 2 study we were conducting did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints, despite promising results in prior studies of a precursor molecule, KB001. In early 2014, we announced termination of development in severe asthma of KB003, also based on negative Phase 2 results despite earlier positive data from studies of KB002, a precursor molecule.\nFurthermore, our Phase 2 expansion trial for KB004, currently enrolling and underway, may not be successful.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and clinical development personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe will need to effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, and other resources in order to successfully pursue our clinical development and commercialization efforts. As a company with a limited number of personnel, we are highly dependent on the expertise of the members of our senior management. We recently announced the retirement of David W. Pritchard, our president and chief executive officer, and in a subsequent reduction in force we announced the elimination of our chief medical officer position. We cannot predict the impact of the loss of such individuals or the loss of services of any of our other senior management, should they occur. Such losses could delay or prevent the further development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and, if we are not successful in finding suitable replacements, could harm our business.\nOur success also depends on our continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel and we may not be able to do so in the future due to recent events, intense competition among biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, universities, and research organizations for qualified personnel. We have initiated a search for permanent chief executive officer and at this time do not plan to replace the CMO position, although we are actively recruiting for additional senior staff with oncology expertise in light of our dedication to oncology. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, we may experience significant impediments to our ability to implement our business strategy.\nIf we fail to effectively integrate any new executive officers into our organization, the future development and commercialization of our product candidates may suffer, harming future regulatory approvals, sales of our product candidates or our results of operations.\nWe are currently conducting a search for a permanent chief executive officer. There can be no assurance that we can identify and hire such a candidate on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we are successful in locating a permanent chief executive officer, that person will not have worked with our senior executive team. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate any newly hired chief executive officer into our management team and our ability to develop an effective working relationship among senior management. Our failure to integrate this individual and create effective working relationships among the members of management could result in inefficiencies in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, harming future regulatory approvals, sales of our product candidates and our results of operations.\nAny product candidate we or any of our future development partners advance into clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or have other properties that may delay or prevent its regulatory approval or commercialization or limit its commercial potential.\nUnacceptable adverse events caused by any of our product candidates that we advance into clinical trials could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This in turn could prevent us from completing development or commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenue from its sale. For example, we observed fatal intracranial hemorrhages in two subjects deemed possibly related to the study drug by the study investigator in our KB004 Phase 1 clinical trial and, as a result, we amended our clinical protocol, which caused a delay in our program.\nWe have not yet successfully completed testing of any of our product candidates for the treatment of the indications for which we intend to seek approval in humans, and we currently do not know the extent of adverse events, if any, that will be observed in individuals who receive any of our product candidates. If any of our product candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product candidate.\nIf we pursue development of a companion diagnostic intended to identify patients who are likely to benefit from treatment with KB004, failure to obtain approval for the diagnostic may prevent or delay approval of KB004.\nWe are in the initial phases of developing an in vitro EphA3 diagnostic, currently in the CLIA validated laboratory format, which is intended to identify patients who are likely to benefit from KB004. We have amended our study protocol prior to initiation of the Phase 2 expansion phase to include EphA3 positive tumor status as an inclusion criterion.\nThe FDA regulates companion diagnostics such as the one we are developing as medical devices. FDA regulations pertaining to medical devices govern, among other things, the research, design, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, storage, record-keeping, packaging, labeling, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, and import and export of medical devices. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the controls the FDA determines necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy. In July 2011, the FDA issued a draft guidance that stated that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product until it is ready to approve or clear the in vitro companion diagnostic device. It is possible that KB004 may not be approved until the FDA has sufficient information to also approve or clear our companion device. Moreover, the FDA\u2019s expectations for in vitro companion diagnostics are evolving and some aspects of the FDA\u2019s regulatory approach remain unclear. The FDA\u2019s developing expectations will affect, among other things, the development, testing and review of any in vitro companion diagnostics.\nBecause our companion diagnostic candidate is at an early stage of development, and because we have not yet decided whether to pursue a reference lab-based test or a kit, we have yet to seek a meeting with the FDA to discuss our companion diagnostic test in development. We therefore do not yet know what the FDA will require for this test. We may not be able to develop or obtain approval or clearance for the companion diagnostic, and any delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval or clearance could delay development or prevent approval of KB004.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for the target indications of our product candidates that are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies as well as with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product candidate development, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, some in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists, and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We will also face competition from these third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, and registering subjects for clinical trials, and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.\nCompetition in cancer drug development including hematology/oncology is intense, with more than 250 compounds in clinical trials by large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of these companies are focused on targeted therapies. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available. In addition, the development program that we undertake may change from time to time due to clinical or non-clinical results, competitive developments, regulatory changes, recruitment, resource or other constraints in running clinical studies and other factors.\nWe are subject to a multitude of manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our products.\nWe are, and will for the foreseeable future continue to be, wholly dependent on third party contract manufacturers for the timely supply of adequate quantities of our products which meet or exceed requisite quality and production standards for use in clinical and nonclinical studies. Given the extensive risks, scope, complexity, cost, regulatory requirements and commitment of resources associated with developing the capabilities to manufacture one or more of our products, we have no present plan or intention of developing in-house manufacturing capabilities for nonclinical, clinical or commercial scale production, beyond our current supervision and management of our third party contract manufacturers. In addition, in order to balance risk and conserve financial and human resources, we have and may continue from time to time to defer commitment to production of product, which could result in delays to the continued progress of our clinical and nonclinical testing.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to several risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nThe process of manufacturing biologics is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination.\n\u00b7\nThe manufacturing facilities in which our products are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, plant closures, capacity constraints, competing customer priorities or changes in corporate strategy or priorities, process changes or failures, changes in business models or operations, materials or labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors.\n\u00b7\nWe are wholly dependent upon third party CMOs for the timely supply of adequate quantities of requisite quality product for our nonclinical, clinical and, if approved by regulatory authorities, commercial scale production.\n\u00b7\nWe, and our contract manufacturers, must comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations and guidelines. We, and our contract manufacturers, may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. We, and our contract manufacturers, are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to follow cGMP or other regulatory requirements or delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to comply with regulatory requirements or pass any regulatory authority inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products, including leading to significant delays in the availability of products for our clinical studies or the termination or hold on a clinical study, or the delay or prevention of a filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approvals for our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could damage our reputation. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.\n\u00b7\nAny adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing, acquiring and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business will be limited.\nA substantial amount of our effort is focused on the continued clinical testing and potential approval of our current product candidates and expanding our product candidates to serve other indications of unmet medical needs. Research programs to identify other indications require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates for other indications are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u00b7\na product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u00b7\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u00b7\nA product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payers, if applicable.\nIf we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates for other indications, our business and future prospects may be limited and our business will be more vulnerable to problems that we encounter in developing and commercializing our current product candidates.\nIf any product candidate that we successfully develop does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenue that it generates may be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors, and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u00b7\nacceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics, and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7\nthe potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n\u00b7\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u00b7\nunfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from that product candidate and may not become or remain profitable.\nReimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product candidate is:\n\u00b7\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7\nsafe, effective, and medically necessary;\n\u00b7\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7\ncost effective; and\n\u00b7\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product candidate from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical, and cost effectiveness data for the use of our product candidates to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels or with restrictions, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our product candidates profitably, or at all, even if approved.\nIn the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. In particular, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 revised the payment methods for many product candidates under Medicare. This has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement. There have been numerous other federal and state initiatives designed to reduce payment for pharmaceuticals.\nAs a result of legislative proposals and the trend toward managed health care in the United States, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also refuse to provide coverage of approved product candidates for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional\nlegislative proposals as well as country, regional, or local healthcare budget limitations.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or fail to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell any product candidates we may successfully develop, we may not be able to effectively market and sell any such product candidates.\nWe do not currently have any infrastructure for the sale, marketing, and distribution of any of our product candidates once approved, if at all, and we must build this infrastructure or make arrangements with third parties to perform these functions in order to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain approval. The establishment and development of a sales force, either by us or jointly with a development partner, or the establishment of a contract sales force to market any product candidates we may develop will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product candidate launch. If we or any of our future development partners are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or any other nontechnical capabilities necessary to commercialize any product candidates we may successfully develop, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such product candidates. We may not be able to establish arrangements with third parties on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe face potential product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims may be brought against us or any of our future development partners by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, health care providers, or others using, administering, or selling our product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we would incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u00b7\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or other claimants;\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our product candidates and loss of revenue;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials domestically and in selected foreign countries where we are conducting clinical trials. As such, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage for product candidates to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development; however, we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product candidates approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our working capital and adversely affect our business.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which leaves us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. For example, we do not carry earthquake insurance. In the event of a major earthquake in our region, our business could suffer significant and uninsured damage and loss. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, auto, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Our recent history may result in an increase in premium costs or otherwise affect the terms of coverage available to us. Any significant, uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our working capital and results of operations.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nAs with any business, we are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation.\nIn addition, during the course of our operations our directors, executives, and employees may have access to material, nonpublic information regarding our business, our results of operations, or potential transactions we are considering. We may not be able to prevent a director, executive, or employee from trading in our common stock on the basis of, or while having access to, material, non-public information. If a director, executive, or employee was to be investigated or an action was to be brought against a director, executive, or employee for insider trading, it could have a negative impact on our reputation and our stock price. Such a claim, with or without merit, could also result in substantial expenditures of time and money, and divert attention of our management team from other tasks important to the success of our business.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we seek to advance our product candidates through clinical trials we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, and sales capabilities, and contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various development partners, suppliers, and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe and our future development partners, third-party manufacturers and suppliers use biological materials and may use hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage, or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly.\nWe and our future development partners, third-party manufacturers and suppliers may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations and the operations of our development partner, third-party manufacturers and suppliers also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation,\nmanufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property, casualty, and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our future development partner, third-party clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our development partner, third-party clinical research organizations and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nHealthcare reform measures, when implemented, could hinder or prevent our commercial success.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of health care and containing or lowering the cost of health care. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:\n\u00b7\nthe demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u00b7\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of capital.\nGovernments may impose price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market our future product candidates in both the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product candidates. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe and any of our future development partners will be required to report to regulatory authorities if any of our approved products cause or contribute to adverse medical events, and any failure to do so would result in sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we and any of our future development partners are successful in commercializing our products, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities would require that we and any of our future development partners report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We and any of our future development partners may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We and any of our future development partners may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we and any of our future development partners fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nOur product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) as part of the Affordable Care Act, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of dissimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u2018\u2018interchangeable\u2019\u2019 based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that any of our product candidates approved as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Finally, there is a risk that the 12-year exclusivity period could be reduced which could negatively affect our products.\nIn addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products. For example, biological products in Europe may be eligible for a 10-year period of exclusivity. However, biosimilar products have been approved under a sub-pathway of the centralized procedure since 2006. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar product to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar product has been demonstrated to be \u2018\u2018similar.\u2019\u2019 In many cases, this allows biosimilar products to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. It is unclear whether we and our development partner would face competition to our products in European markets sooner than anticipated.\nWe may in the future be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties.\nIf one or more of our product candidates is approved, we will likely be subject to the various U.S. federal and state laws intended to prevent health care fraud and abuse. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been\nbroadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors. Violations of the anti-kickback laws can result in exclusion from federal health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties.\nThe False Claims Act (FCA) imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. The FCA includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims. If our marketing or other arrangements were determined to violate the FCA or anti-kickback or related laws, then our revenue could be adversely affected, which would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nState and federal authorities have aggressively targeted medical technology companies for alleged violations of these anti-fraud statutes, based on improper research or consulting contracts with doctors, certain marketing arrangements that rely on volume-based pricing, off-label marketing schemes, and other improper promotional practices. Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans or Corporate Integrity Agreements, and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our contractual relationships with providers or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business.\nAlso, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties, or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the United States may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our current product candidates or any future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u00b7\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n\u00b7\nadditional studies, including clinical studies;\n\u00b7\nrecall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u00b7\nadditional record keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will continue to be subject to ongoing and extensive regulatory requirements, and our failure to comply with these requirements could substantially harm our business.\nIf we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review, such as continued safety reporting requirements, and we may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls or seizures.\nIf the FDA approves any of our product candidates, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping for our products will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the products, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product, and could include withdrawal of the product from the market.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. We may be unable to use these losses to offset income before such unused losses expire. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u2018\u2018ownership change\u2019\u2019 (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have in the past experienced ownership changes that have resulted in limitations on the use of a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards. If we experience further ownership changes our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could be further limited.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet our deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. Therefore, the timing of the initiation and completion of these trials is uncertain and may occur on substantially different timing from our estimates. We also use clinical research organizations (CROs) to conduct our clinical trials and rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, CROs, and consultants to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and regulatory requirements. Our CROs, investigators, and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and subsequent collection and analysis of data.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators, or other third parties on which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines, fails to adhere to our clinical protocols, or otherwise performs in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated. If any of our clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on subjects enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer those subjects to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.\nWe rely completely on third parties, most of which are sole source suppliers, to supply drug substance and manufacture drug product for our clinical trials and preclinical studies and intend to rely on other third parties to produce commercial supplies of product candidates, and our dependence on third parties could adversely impact our business.\nWe are completely dependent on third-party suppliers, most of which are sole source suppliers of the drug substance and drug product for our product candidates. We are continually evaluating potential alternate sources of supply but there can be no assurance that any such suppliers would be available, acceptable or successful. If these third-party suppliers do not supply sufficient quantities for product candidates to us on a timely basis and in accordance with applicable specifications and other regulatory requirements, there could be a significant interruption of our supplies, which would adversely affect clinical development of the product candidate. Furthermore, if any of our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and with regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval, if any, for our product candidates.\nWe will also rely on our contract manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials used to manufacture our product candidates. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our contract manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have agreements in place for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of that clinical trial, product candidate testing, and potential regulatory approval of that product candidate.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture any of our proposed product candidates if approved, and will likely continue to be dependent on third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply us with clinical trial materials and any approved product candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis.\nHaving recently terminated our development partnership with Sanofi, we will not continue development or commercialization of KB001-A without a future development partner. Our development and/or commercialization of KB004, KB003 and any other future products may also depend in whole or in part on a future development partner. Our inability to successfully identify and enter into a development partnership, or the failure of any new partner to develop and/or commercialize one or more of our products, could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn 2014, we announced the mutual termination of our exclusive license to Sanofi of KB001, KB001-A and other antibodies directed against the PcrV protein of Pa for all indications for most aspects of their development and commercialization. Before that termination, we were dependent on Sanofi to carry out its contractual obligations, and did not have significant control over their efforts or the outcome of those efforts. Now that our development partnership with Sanofi on KB001-A or other antibodies has terminated, we will not continue further development of KB001-A unless we enter into a new partnership(s) for that further development of KB001-A. We also intend to explore development and/or commercial partnerships for KB004 and any other of our future products. Any new partnership for one or more of our products, assuming we are able to successfully identify and enter into such a transaction(s), may not be scientifically, medically, technically or commercially successful due to a number of important factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nRegardless of the standard of effort required under any new partnership agreement, any new partner will likely have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that it will apply to the development and commercialization of our product;\n\u00b7\nThe timing and amount of any contingent, royalty or other payments we may receive under any new agreement have yet to be determined and will depend on, among other things, the efforts, allocation of resources, and successful development and commercialization of our product candidate by the new partner under any such agreement;\n\u00b7\nA new partner, if any, may change the focus of its development and commercialization efforts or pursue higher- priority programs;\n\u00b7\nA new partner, if any, may not make timely regulatory submissions;\n\u00b7\nThe terms of any new partnership agreement have yet to be identified, and may not be optimal for us in any number of respects, including but not limited to the amount, timing and contingencies associated with any payments or funding to us; the degree of control or influence we may have over any partners\u2019 efforts; the indications, territories, responsibilities, rights, obligations and recourse available to us under any partnership agreement; and the other economic and non-economic terms of any partnership agreement;\n\u00b7\nIf a new partner negotiates for clinical supply manufacturing rights, such partner may fail to manufacture or supply sufficient drug substance of our product for our clinical use, which could result in program delays;\n\u00b7\nIf a new partner negotiates for commercial supply manufacturing rights, such partner may fail to manufacture or supply sufficient drug substance of our product for our commercial use, if approved, which could result in delays and lost revenue;\n\u00b7\nAny new partner may utilize our intellectual property rights or take actions related to licensed products in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or expose us to potential liability;\n\u00b7\nAny new partner may not comply with all applicable regulatory requirements or may fail to report safety data in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nIf a new partner were to breach or terminate any agreement with us, the development and commercialization of our product could be delayed. We would need to either use our own resources and capabilities to continue the development and commercialization of our product or grant rights to another development or commercial partner, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7\nIf any new partner were to terminate any future partnership arrangements with us, our potential revenue under such an agreement, including from potential development and commercial contingent payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products, would be significantly reduced or eliminated; and\n\u00b7\nAny new partner may not dedicate the resources that would be necessary to carry the product candidate through clinical development or may not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market our product.\nOur or any new partner\u2019s failure to develop, manufacture or effectively commercialize our product would result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, proprietary technologies, and their uses as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that our patent applications or those of our licensors will result in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technology, nor can there be any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around, or invalidated by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, we may not have adequate resources to devote to the substantial costs of enforcing intellectual property rights in affected jurisdictions. Any failure\nto properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to these product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nComposition-of-matter patents on the biological or chemical active pharmaceutical ingredient are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition-of-matter of our product candidates will be considered patentable by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our issued composition-of-matter patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \u2018\u2018off-label.\u2019\u2019 Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case;\n\u00b7\npatent applications may not result in any patents being issued, with or without oppositions being filed by competitors or other third parties;\n\u00b7\npatents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u00b7\nour competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthere may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u00b7\ncountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop, and market competing product candidates.\nFurthermore, we and our development partners rely on the protection of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. For example, we rely on Novartis, to whom we have licensed our Humaneered\u00ae platform, to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how that has been licensed to them. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants, and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information independently. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nAdditionally, in the U.S., the central provisions of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) became effective on March 16, 2013. Among other things, this law will switch U.S. patent rights from the present \u2018\u2018first-to-invent\u2019\u2019 system to\na \u2018\u2018first inventor-to-file\u2019\u2019 system. This may result in inventors and companies having to file patent applications more frequently to preserve rights in their inventions. This may favor larger competitors that have greater resources to file more patent applications.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we or any of our future development partners are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability and the ability of any of our future development partners to develop, manufacture, market, and sell our product candidates without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S.-issued and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates, some of which may contain claims that overlap with the subject matter of our intellectual property or are directed at our product candidates. When we become aware of patents held by third parties that may implicate the manufacture, development or commercialization of our product candidates, we evaluate our need to license rights to such patents. For example, we have entered into several licenses for the right to use third-party intellectual property, including with UCSF and LICR. If we need to license rights from third parties to manufacture, develop or commercialize our product candidates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents upon which our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we are not aware.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers, or development partners infringe upon a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to:\n\u00b7\nseek to obtain licenses that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nabandon an infringing product candidate or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u00b7\npay substantial damages including, in an exceptional case, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product candidate or proprietary technology at issue infringes upon or violates the third party\u2019s rights;\n\u00b7\npay substantial royalties or fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our technology; and/or\n\u00b7\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nAny such claims against us could also be deemed to constitute an event of default under our loan and security agreement with MidCap Financial. In the case of a continuing event of default under the loan, MidCap Financial could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, commence and prosecute bankruptcy and/or other insolvency proceedings, or proceed against the collateral granted to MidCap Financial under the loan.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe upon our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nIn addition, any future patent litigation, interference, or other administrative proceedings will result in additional expense and distraction of our personnel. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us, or any of our future development partners to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nIf we or any of our future development partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, or one of our future product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may fail to comply with any of our obligations under existing agreements pursuant to which we license rights or technology, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business.\nWe are a party to technology licenses that are important to our business and we may enter into additional licenses in the future. We currently hold licenses from the Medical College of Wisconsin, UCSF, LICR, BioWa, Lonza, and Sanofi. These licenses impose various commercial, contingent payments, royalty, insurance, indemnification, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would lose valuable rights under our collaboration agreements and our ability to develop product candidates.\nWe may be subject to claims that our consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers to us.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at, or may have previously or may be currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies\nincluding our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that our company or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming, and inherently uncertain. In addition, Congress may pass patent reform legislation. The Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents we might obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and we intend to seek patent protection only in selected countries. Our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. For example, on September 3, 2013 we entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement with MLV & Co. LLC (MLV) under which, subject to certain conditions, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50,000,000 from time to time through MLV, acting as agent.\nOn October 1, 2013, we completed a secondary offering of common stock which resulted in dilution of our existing shareholders. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance could result in further dilution to our stockholders.\nAny future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including, among other restrictions, limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation, or asset sale transactions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to grant potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report on our audited financial statements.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 stating that our recurring net losses at December 31, 2014 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. We may also be forced to make reductions in spending, including delaying or curtailing our ongoing or future clinical programs. Future reports from our independent registered public accounting firm may also contain statements expressing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe previously identified and have remediated a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules, our management was required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. When and if we are no longer an \u2018\u2018emerging growth company,\u2019\u2019 as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nAlthough we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014, as indicated in our Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting. If our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year-end, we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal year-end. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year-end (or if our independent registered public accounting firm concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls or, after we are no longer an emerging growth company, is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nOur stock price is volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is volatile and from January 31, 2013, the first day of trading of our common stock, to March 9, 2015, our stock had high and low sales prices in the range of $8.25 to $0.36 per share. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors include those discussed in this \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section of this report and others such as:\n\u00b7\ndelay or failure in initiating or completing preclinical studies or clinical trials, or unsatisfactory results of these trials and the resulting impact on ongoing product development;\n\u00b7\nannouncements regarding equity or debt financing transactions;\n\u00b7\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nannouncements about us or about our competitors including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, or new product candidate introductions;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments concerning our development partner, licensors or product candidate manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nconditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries and the economy as a whole;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental regulation and legislation;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment or departure of members of our board of directors, management team or other key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nany financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, our failure to meet these projections, or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u00b7\nchange in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations; and\n\u00b7\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market or resulting from inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares.\nIn recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the companies whose stock is experiencing those price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock shortly following our initial public offering.\nIn a particular case, following the announcement of our failed Phase 2 study of KB001-A, on February 23, 2015, we received a notice of possible delisting from the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, as our stock declined below $1.00 per share for over thirty (30) business days as required by NASDAQ regulations. We are evaluating possible measures to return our share price to above $1.00 so that our listing would not be affected, and generally we have a period of 180 days from the date of the notice to do so. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. Any de-listing of our shares could affect the liquidity of our stock, even if we retain a public company listing through other channels.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained or may be volatile.\nOur initial public offering was completed in February 2013, and we subsequently completed a secondary public offering of additional common shares later in 2013. Nevertheless, we continue to have a limited number of shares publicly available for purchase. An active trading market may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration. In addition, the public market for our shares may be extremely volatile in light of the results of our operations, our limited resources, the number of products we may have in development at any given time, and numerous other factors.\nSubstantial future sales of shares by existing stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders, particularly our directors and executive officers and the venture capital funds affiliated with our current and former directors, sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or are perceived by the public market as intending to sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. As of December 31, 2014, we had 32,992,178 shares of common stock outstanding. On July 31, 2013, 14,697,573 shares that were previously subject to contractual lock-up agreements entered into by certain of our stockholders with the underwriters in connection with our initial public offering became freely tradable, except for shares of common stock held by directors, executive officers and our other affiliates, which are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of December 25, 2013, approximately 5,409,636 shares that were previously subject to contractual lock-up agreements entered into by certain of our stockholders with the underwriters in connection with our follow-on public offering became freely tradable, except for shares of common stock held by directors, executive officers and our other affiliates, which are subject to volume and other limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nCertain holders or our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for our stockholders or ourselves. These shares will be able to be sold freely in the public market upon issuance.\nWe have also registered 4,325,912 shares of our common stock that we may issue under our equity plans. Once we issue these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to any vesting restriction or Rule 144 transfer restrictions applicable to affiliates.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities and industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes unfavorable research about our business, or if our clinical trials or operating results fail to meet the analysts\u2019 expectations, as recently occurred with respect to KB001-A and KB003 and their respective Phase 2 study results, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nRequirements associated with being a public reporting company will continue to increase our costs significantly, as well as divert significant company resources and management attention.\nWe have only been subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the other rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since August 2012. We are working with our legal, independent accounting, and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public reporting company. These areas\ninclude corporate governance, corporate control, disclosure controls and procedures, and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. Compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public reporting companies will require considerable time, attention of management, and financial resources. In addition, the changes we make may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public reporting company on a timely basis.\nFurther, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, stockholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. Moreover, the reporting requirements, rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, on acceptable terms.\nIn addition, being a public company could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nAny changes we make to comply with these obligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Additionally, our loan and security agreement with MidCap Financial contains covenants that restrict our ability to pay dividends. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on an investment in our common stock will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which you purchased it.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur directors, executive officers, and the holders of more than 5% of our common stock together with their affiliates beneficially own approximately 39% of our common stock as of December 31, 2014. These stockholders, acting together, may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nAs a public company, our stock price has been volatile, and securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility of their stock price. Any such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has sometimes been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u00b7\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u00b7\ndo not provide stockholders with the ability to cumulate their votes; and\n\u00b7\nrequire advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nWe are an emerging growth company and the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards and reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We plan to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we also intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis). If we do, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies.\nInvestors could find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions, which may make it more difficult for investors to compare our business with other companies in our industry. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. If we are unable to do so, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (iv) December 31, 2017, the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act.", "PERMNO": 13755, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HGEN"}
