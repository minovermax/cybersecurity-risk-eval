{"cik": "844143", "company": "JOE'S JEANS INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.\nWe are in default of our financing agreements entered into in connection with the acquisition of Hudson and there is no assurance or certainty of resolution.\nWe incurred substantial indebtedness to finance the acquisition of Hudson, including approximately $32,445,000 in the aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, a $60,000,000 term loan facility, and a $50,000,000 revolving credit facility. On November 6, 2014, we received an initial notice of default and event of default and demand for payment of default interest from Garrison as term loan agent, under the term loan facility entered into on September 30, 2013. As a result of the event of default under the term loan facility, this also triggered a default and an event of default under the terms of the revolving credit facility with CIT entered into on September 30, 2013. As a result of such defaults and events of default, both of CIT and Garrison have reserved their respective rights to exercise any and all remedies available to them under their respective agreements and have demanded payment of interest under those agreements at the default rate of interest. In addition, as a result of the events of default under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility, we are also in default of our subordinated convertible notes issued to the former equity owners of Hudson. However, under the terms of the agreements with CIT and Garrison, we are prohibited from making any payments under the subordinated convertible notes, but are accruing interest at the default rate. We are also prohibited from making buy-out payments to Mr. Dahan. On February 10, 2015, we received second notices of default and events of default for failure to comply with certain financial covenants and a demand for continued payment of default interest from both Garrison and CIT.\nWe are currently in discussions with Garrison and CIT regarding a resolution to the defaults and events of default, including refinancing some or all of the debt and/or amendments to some or all of the existing agreements. We have engaged Carl Marks Advisory Group to help the Board explore strategic and financing alternatives to resolve the outstanding events of default with CIT and Garrison. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance or that the requested amendments will be granted on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain reasonable refinancing for such indebtedness and maintain sufficient cash flow to fund our operations, we, as a whole, may be forced to make a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to seek protection from our creditors or we may be forced to surrender certain properties securing our indebtedness in satisfaction of such indebtedness, or both.\nA failure to secure a resolution, or an acceleration of our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and could restrict our ability to operate as a going concern or cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nUnless we are able to secure a resolution to the defaults, Garrison and CIT, under both the term loan facility and revolving credit facility, are entitled to, among other things, accelerate the outstanding amounts under their respective agreements. Any such acceleration by Garrison and/or CIT under the respective credit facilities would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. Since all of our assets are subject to liquidation by the creditors, liquidation could result in no assets being left for the stockholders after the creditors receive their required payment. As such, any failure to secure a resolution or an acceleration of our indebtedness will restrict our ability to operate as a going concern.\nAdditionally, we cannot predict whether our efforts to extend or refinance our substantial debt will be successful. For example, we could be forced to sell our assets on unfavorable terms or, our lenders could seek to foreclose on the property or properties securing the debt, which could cause the loss of any anticipated income and cash flow from, and our invested capital in, the assets. Moreover, we could be required to utilize an increasing percentage of our cash flow to service any remaining debt or any new debt incurred with a refinancing, which would further limit our cash flow available to fund business operations and our strategic plan. We have engaged Carl Marks Advisory Group to help the Board explore strategic and financing alternatives to resolve the outstanding events of default with CIT and\nGarrison. If we are unable to obtain reasonable refinancing for such indebtedness and maintain sufficient cash flow to fund our operations, we, as a whole, may be forced to make a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to seek protection from our creditors or we may be forced to surrender certain properties securing our indebtedness in satisfaction of such indebtedness, or both.\nOur auditors have reported that there are substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nMoss Adams LLP, our independent auditor, has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as going concern, given our recurring losses from operations and net working capital deficiency. The accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2014 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Although our consolidated financial statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue our business.\nWe are currently in discussions with Garrison and CIT under both of the term loan credit agreement and revolving credit agreement regarding a resolution to the defaults, and our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon us resolving the outstanding indebtedness. Our failure to cure the defaults could result in an acceleration of the debt by either or both lenders, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. Since all of our assets are subject to liquidation by the creditors, a liquidation could result in no assets being left for the stockholders after the creditors receive their required payment.\nEven if we are able to refinance or extend our indebtedness, the substantial indebtedness we have incurred could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nEven if we are able to refinance or extend our indebtedness, our indebtedness could still have important consequences to us. It is possible that refinanced or extended debt will contain terms, such as more restrictive operational and financial covenants and higher fees and interest rates that are less attractive than the terms contained in the debt being refinanced or extended. Our substantial indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the fashion industry and the general economy. In addition, we may be required to dedicate a substantial and increasing portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments. This could reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other needs, and limit our ability to react to changes in our industry and capitalize on business opportunities. This may also place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may have greater financial strength than we do.\nIn addition, we may not be able to fund our future capital needs, including necessary working capital, funds for capital expenditures or acquisition financing from operating cash flow. Consequently, we may have to rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. We may be unable to obtain third-party financing on favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flow and liquidity. Any additional debt would increase our leverage, which would reduce our operational flexibility and increase our risk exposure.\nThe restrictive financial and other covenants to which we have agreed in connection with the incurrence of such debt, and our increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio in comparison to that on a recent historical basis may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness.\nAll of our assets are pledged under our agreements with CIT and Garrison and, as a result, we have limited flexibility to sell or finance unencumbered property to satisfy our cash needs.\nIn addition to being dependent on our financing agreements with CIT and Garrison, we have pledged to CIT and/or Garrison as collateral all of our tangible and intangible assets, which include trademarks, raw materials such as fabric and trim, finished goods, and our receivables. Since we are currently in default, should the parties elect to terminate the agreements, which they have the ability to do, we would be required to pay our liabilities to CIT and Garrison. If we were unable or unwilling to pay all or part of our liabilities, our lenders could exercise their rights under the agreements to the pledged collateral and sell any or all of these assets. In the event our lenders elect this remedy, our operations and our sales could be materially adversely impacted by the sale of those assets or our inability to utilize these assets in our normal business operations. As a result, we have limited flexibility to sell or finance an unencumbered property to satisfy our cash needs. In addition, our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required debt service payments and we may not be able to extend, repay or refinance our maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all. In connection with the revolving and term loan agreements, we have certain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur indebtedness; create liens; consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve; sell, lease or otherwise transfer any assets; substantially change the nature of the business; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends; enter into transactions with affiliates; amend material documents, prepay indebtedness and make capital expenditures. In addition, all of our assets, including our trademarks, secure our obligations under the revolving and term loan agreements.\nIn order to effectively manage our operations, we are dependent on financing arrangements and our cash flow from operations.\nPrior to the acquisition of Hudson in fiscal 2013, our primary sources of liquidity were: (i) cash from sales of our products; (ii) sales from accounts receivable factoring facilities and advances against inventory; and (iii) utilizing existing cash balances. Since the acquisition of Hudson, in addition to cash flow from operations, we have been dependent upon our revolving credit facility with CIT and the term loan agreement with Garrison. Since we are in default under those agreements and there is no assurance of being able to refinance or extend our indebtedness with CIT and Garrison, we could be restricted in our ability to borrow against our accounts receivable and receive advances against inventory should CIT decide to take such action. Failure to achieve resolution to the defaults may result in us not being able to effectively manage our operations. While we may be able to find alternative sources for obtaining the cash for our operating needs, including refinancing or extending our indebtedness, it may be difficult to do so.\nThe resignation of our president and chief executive officer, the appointment of our interim chief executive officer and any potential search for, and appointment of, a long-term chief executive officer could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOn January 19, 2015, our Board, accepted the resignation of Marc Crossman as our president and chief executive officer. Our Board appointed Samuel J. (Sam) Furrow as interim chief executive officer. As a result of this change, we may experience disruption or have difficulty in maintaining or developing our business during this transition. Further, any potential search for, and hiring of, a permanent chief executive officer may also cause disruption or result in difficulty in maintaining or developing our business. The existence of the defaults and events of defaults with Garrison and CIT may hinder our ability to find a suitable chief executive officer candidate. As a result, our search may be delayed until we have a resolution with CIT and Garrison.\nAs a result of the resignation of Mr. Crossman and appointment of an interim chief executive officer, our senior management team has limited experience working together as a group. This lack of shared experience could negatively impact our senior management team's ability to quickly and\nefficiently respond to problems and effectively manage our business. If our management team is not able to work together as a group, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nLoss of key personnel could disrupt our operations.\nOur continued success is dependent on the ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, designers, administrative talent and sales associates to support existing operations and future growth. Competition for qualified talent in the apparel and fashion industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have greater financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any members of senior management or the inability to attract and retain other qualified executives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition of Hudson.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with integrating the operations of Hudson. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses resulting from the acquisition have been and may continue to be comprised of transaction costs related to the acquisition, facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment related costs. We may also continue to incur transaction fees and costs related to carrying out and completing the integration of Hudson. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to more than offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nIf we are unable to manage and sustain our growth, particularly with the addition of the Hudson business, our business and financial results could suffer.\nOur future financial results will depend in large part on our ability to profitably manage our core businesses, including any growth related to the acquisition of Hudson. Over the past several years, both of Hudson and Joe's have engaged in the identification of, and competition for, growth and expansion opportunities. In order to achieve those initiatives, we will need to, among other things, recruit, train, retain and effectively manage employees and expand our operations and financial control systems. If we are unable to manage our businesses effectively and profitably, our business and financial results could suffer.\nThe acquisition of Hudson could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe entered into the stock purchase agreement in connection with the acquisition of Hudson with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings, operating efficiencies and growth opportunities. To date, we have not integrated the operations of Hudson in any material respect. Our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition continues to remain subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the business of Hudson becomes integrated in a successful manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company and diversion of management's time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the combined company's business, financial results and prospects.\nOur success will depend on increasing our sales, improving our margins, profitably operating our retail stores and integrating Hudson into our operations.\nOur ability to operate profitably depends on our ability to implement our strategic plan with success, including the integration of Hudson into our operations. During fiscal 2014, we recognized growth for our Joe's\u00ae brand through increases in our retail sales and Joe's\u00ae men's domestic sales and the addition of our Hudson\u00ae brand.\nSince we have primarily been a wholesaler, opening and operating retail stores has required us to develop retailing skills and capabilities and increase our expenditures. We are required to enter into leases, increase our rental expenses and make capital expenditures for these stores. These commitments may be costly to terminate, and these investments may be difficult to recapture if we decide to close a store or change our strategy. We must also offer a broad product assortment, appropriately manage retail inventory levels, install and operate effective retail systems, execute effective pricing strategies and integrate our stores into our overall business mix. Finally, we need to hire and train additional qualified employees and incur additional costs to operate these stores, which increase our operating expenses. If we do not manage these items properly, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our future success will depend on our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate Hudson's business, operations and personnel. Even if integration is successful, the financial performance of the acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated revenue and earnings enhancements and other anticipated synergies from the acquisition of Hudson. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefit could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWhile we believe that we are putting in place the mechanisms necessary to successfully implement these strategies, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our level of expectations. Further, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will result in profitability for us in the short term or in the future.\nOur success will further depend on implementing a shift in Hudson's denim production from primarily domestic production to foreign production.\nOur Hudson\u00ae brand has historically produced substantially all of its denim apparel in Los Angeles, California. Our ability to improve operational efficiencies and profitably will depend upon the successful implementation of shifting all or substantially all of Hudson's\u00ae denim production to Mexico to achieve better production costs and margin improvement and to share production resources with our manufacturing relationships in Mexico currently producing our Joe's\u00ae branded products. To date, only a minor portion of Hudson's production has been shifted to Mexico. There are risks and uncertainties when undertaking large-scale changes in denim production and sourcing, particularly in a foreign country. There can be no assurances that such a large-scale move will not affect the fit, quality or construction of our Hudson\u00ae branded denim.\nOur success will further depend on customer reception to Hudson producing non-United States denim products.\nWhile we have been successful in making the transition from domestic production to Mexico production for our Joe's\u00ae branded products, and have seen negligible, if any, negative reaction from our customers and our customers have come to accept our Joe's\u00ae branded products regardless of where we produce, because Hudson has different brand awareness amongst its loyal customers and because Hudson\u00ae has historically produced substantially all of its denim in the United States, we may\nexperience negative reaction from the Hudson\u00ae customer base and negative reception for denim not produced in the United States.\nWe may experience disruption to our operations if we experience a substantial reduction in personnel in connection with the integration of Hudson.\nWhile we expect to realize efficiencies related to the integration of Hudson into our business, we may experience disruption in our operations if there is a substantial reduction in our personnel. In order to achieve a successful integration of Hudson, we will need to, among other things, retain and effectively manage employees. If we experience a large-scale loss of employees as a result of the integration, we may be unable to manage our businesses effectively and profitably, and our business and financial results could suffer.\nProblems with our Hudson third party distribution system could harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies.\nOur Hudson brand relies on a distribution facility operated by a third party in Commerce, California. Our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale partners and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of this distribution facility. This third party will continue to provide distribution services, until we elect to terminate such services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into other contracts for an alternate or replacement distribution centers on acceptable terms or at all. Such an event could disrupt our operations. In addition, because substantially all of our products are distributed from one location, our operations could also be interrupted by labor difficulties, or by floods, fires, earthquakes or other natural disasters near such facility. We maintain business interruption insurance; however, this coverage may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions to our distribution system. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies could be harmed. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space, are generally subject to long-term non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases, and any failure to make these lease payments when due would likely harm our business, profitability and results of operations.\nWe do not own any of our stores, but instead lease all of our retail stores under operating leases and are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing real estate. Our leases generally have initial terms of 5 to 10 years, and generally can be extended for one additional 5- to 10-year term. All of our leases require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. We generally cannot terminate our leases and have restrictions in connection with assigning or subletting our leases Most of our leases are \"net\" leases, which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities, and we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. Additionally, certain of our leases may allow the lessor to terminate the lease or not renew if we do not achieve a specified gross sales threshold in later years. Although we believe we will achieve the required threshold to continue those leases, we cannot assure you that we will do so. Any loss of our store locations due to underperformance may harm our results of operations, stock price and reputation.\nAdditional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term if we cannot negotiate a mutually acceptable termination payment. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. Of our existing leases, one existing retail lease expired in fiscal 2014 and one existing retail lease will expire in May 2015. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close, our business, profitability and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on successfully locating our stores in suitable locations and any impairment of a store location, including any decrease in customer traffic, could cause our sales to be less than expected.\nOur approach to identifying locations for our retail stores typically favors street and mall locations near luxury and contemporary retailers that we believe are consistent with our key customers' demographics and shopping preferences. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of foot traffic in these locations. Changes in areas around our existing retail locations that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales to be less than expected and the related leases are generally non-cancelable. Store locations may become unsuitable due to, and our sales volume and customer traffic generally may be harmed by, among other things:\n\u2022 economic downturns in a particular area;\n\u2022 competition from nearby retailers selling similar apparel;\n\u2022 changing consumer demographics in a particular market;\n\u2022 changing preferences of consumers in a particular market;\n\u2022 the closing or decline in popularity of other businesses located near our store; and\n\u2022 store impairments due to acts of God or terrorism.\nOur ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to:\n\u2022 identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores will be successful;\n\u2022 obtain desired locations, including store size and adjacencies, in targeted malls or streets;\n\u2022 negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired rent and tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations;\n\u2022 achieve brand awareness, affinity and purchase intent in the new markets;\n\u2022 hire, train and retain store associates and field management;\n\u2022 assimilate new store associates and field management into our corporate culture;\n\u2022 source and supply sufficient inventory levels; and\n\u2022 successfully integrate new retail stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.\nAs of February 13, 2015, we had 33 stores, which consist of 13 full price retail stores and 20 outlet locations. We will continue to evaluate our plan to continue increasing our store base; however, we do not have any signed leases for store openings in 2015 or beyond. Our new stores may not be immediately profitable and we may incur losses until these stores become profitable. Unavailability of desired store locations, delays in the acquisition or opening of new stores, delays or costs resulting from a decrease in commercial development due to capital restraints, difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations or a lack of customer acceptance of stores in new market areas may negatively impact our new store growth and the costs or the profitability associated with new stores. There can be no assurance that we will open new stores in fiscal 2015 or thereafter. Any failure to successfully open and operate new stores may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be unable to grow comparable store sales or average sales per square foot in our retail stores, which could cause our share price to decline.\nWe may not be able to grow our comparable store sales or average sales per square foot in our retail stores. If our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the aggregate results of operations through our wholesale partners and at our retail locations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, consumer spending patterns, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our product assortment, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods or our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nGeneral economic conditions in the United States and other parts of the world, including a continued weakening of the economy and restricted credit markets, can affect consumer confidence and consumer spending patterns.\nThe general economy in the United States and abroad continues to be in the midst of uncertainty. The apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits which could negatively impact our business overall, the carrying value of our tangible and intangible assets and specifically sales, gross margins and profitability. Our business depends on the general economic environment and levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also retailers, our largest direct customers. Purchases of high-fashion apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, when consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items, and disposable income decline. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others: prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. During periods of recession or economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open and operate new retail stores, or maintain or improve our earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales. As a result, our operating results may be adversely and materially affected by downward trends in the United States or global economy.\nThe financial markets have also been extremely volatile and resulted in declines in security prices and diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that our liquidity and our ability to access the credit or capital markets will not be affected by changes in the financial markets\nand the global economy. Continuing turmoil in the financial markets could make it more difficult for us to access capital, sell assets, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities.\nIn addition, the reduced availability of credit is having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world, and the impact of this reduced availability on our suppliers and other vendors cannot be predicted. The inability of suppliers and other vendors to access liquidity, or the insolvency of suppliers and other vendors, could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise or other services that we require. Worsening economic conditions could also impair our ability to collect amounts as they become due from our customers, or other third parties that do business with us. We also face the increased risk of order reductions or cancellations when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty.\nEconomic conditions have also led to a highly promotional environment and strong discounting pressure from both our wholesale partners and retail customers, which could lead to a negative impact on our revenues and profitability. This promotional environment may continue even after economic growth returns, as we expect consumer spending trends are likely to remain at historically depressed levels for the foreseeable future. The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities around the world could lead to further decreases in consumer spending.\nWe face risks associated with constantly changing fashion trends, including consumer's response to our products. If we are unable to adapt to changing fashion trends, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demand and fashion trends in a timely manner. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect the acceptance of our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities in the marketplace. If that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability. At the same time, a focus on tight management of inventory may result, from time to time, in our not having an adequate supply of products to meet consumer demand and may cause us to lose sales.\nWe attempt to minimize our risk associated with delivering items through early order commitments by retailers. We must generally place production orders with manufacturers before we have received all of a season's orders and orders may be cancelled by retailers before shipment. Therefore, if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to consumer preferences, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by a change in consumer demand for denim in the marketplace.\nDenim, including premium denim, an industry term for denim jeans with a typical retail price of approximately $120 or more, has been increasingly popular and growing in sales over the past several years as a consumer discretionary purchase both domestically and internationally. However, because consumer demands and fashion trends are subject to cyclical variations as well as the fact that the general economy and future economic prospects can often affect consumer spending habits, a change in any one of the following:\n\u2022 consumer demand,\n\u2022 consumer purchases of discretionary items,\n\u2022 general economic conditions, or\n\u2022 fashion trends,\nmay result in lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins for our Joe's\u00ae or Hudson\u00ae products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition in the denim industry. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nWe face a variety of competitive challenges from other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel producers, some of whom may be significantly larger and more diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. We do not currently hold a dominant competitive position in any market. We compete with other denim manufacturers such as AG, Paige Premium Denim, Rag and Bone Seven for All Mankind, Citizens of Humanity, J Brand and True Religion and other larger competitors primarily on the basis of:\n\u2022 anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner,\n\u2022 maintaining favorable brand recognition,\n\u2022 developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors and styles that appeal to consumers,\n\u2022 appropriately pricing products,\n\u2022 providing strong and effective marketing support,\n\u2022 creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers,\n\u2022 ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers, and\n\u2022 obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors are privately held corporations and may have resources available to them that we, as a public company, do not have. Therefore, it may be difficult for us to effectively gauge consumer response to our products and how our products are competing with these and other competitors in the marketplace. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBoth of our Joe's\u00ae and Hudson\u00ae branded businesses depend on a strong brand image, and if we are not able to maintain or enhance our brand, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise, which would harm our business and cause our results of operations to suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing both our Joe's and Hudson brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as visual merchandising, marketing and advertising, employee training and store operations. We anticipate that, as our business expands into new markets and further penetrates existing markets, and as the markets in which we operate become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Certain of our competitors in the apparel industry have faced adverse publicity surrounding the quality, attributes and performance of their products. Our brand may similarly be adversely affected if our public image or reputation is tarnished by failing to maintain high standards for merchandise quality\nand integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a leader in the contemporary apparel industry and to continue to provide high quality products. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nA substantial portion of our net sales and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers, and the loss of any of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Joe's\u00ae brand is substantially dependent on its 10 largest customers and customer groups, which accounted for approximately 65 percent of its net sales during fiscal 2014. Only one of its largest customer, Nordstrom Inc., individually accounted for over 10 percent of its net sales in fiscal 2014. Our Hudson\u00ae brand is substantially dependent on its 10 largest customers and customer groups, which accounted for approximately 66 percent of its net sales during fiscal 2014. Its largest customer, Nordstrom, Inc., accounted for over 39 percent of its net sales in fiscal 2014. We do not enter into any type of long-term agreements or firm commitment orders with any of our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of individual purchase order commitments with our customers. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, including our limited number of private label customers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us, to change their manner of doing business with us, to cancel orders previously placed in advance of shipment dates or a decision to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to find an alternative customer for our products in a timely manner.\nOur plans to improve and expand our product offerings may not be successful, and the implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.\nWe plan to grow our business by increasing our core product offerings, which includes expanding our Joe's men's collection, denim, outerwear, women's bottoms and dresses assortment and expanding our Hudson product collection. We will continue to evaluate our plan to develop and introduce select new product categories and pursue select additional licensing opportunities in other categories.\nThe principal risks to our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings are that:\n\u2022 if our expected product offerings fail to maintain and enhance our brand identity, our image may be diminished or diluted;\n\u2022 if we fail to find and enter into relationships with external partners with the necessary specialized expertise; and\n\u2022 the use of licensing partners may limit our ability to conduct comprehensive final quality checks on merchandise.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings may be affected by economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer preferences and style trends. These plans could be abandoned, could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could impact our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.\nOur current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control.\nOur current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control. We have entered into three licensing agreements for Joe's: children's, shoes and intimates. We have entered into one license agreement for Hudson: children's. In the future, we may enter into select additional licensing arrangements for product offerings which require specialized expertise. We may also enter into select licensing agreements pursuant to which we may grant third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographic areas. Although we have taken and will continue to take steps to select potential licensing partners carefully and to monitor the activities of our licensing partners (through, among other things, approval rights over product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, marketing, distribution and advertising), such arrangements may not be successful. Our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. In addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partner's ability to:\n\u2022 obtain capital;\n\u2022 exercise operational and financial control over its business;\n\u2022 manage its labor relations;\n\u2022 maintain relationships with suppliers;\n\u2022 manage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and\n\u2022 maintain customer relationships.\nAny of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements.\nOur licensees may not comply with our product quality, manufacturing standards, marketing and other requirements, which may have an adverse effect on our brand equity, reputation or our business.\nWe license our Joe's\u00ae trademarks to third parties for manufacturing, marketing and distribution of children's products, shoes and intimates. Additionally, we license our Hudson\u00ae trademarks to third parties for manufacturing, marketing and distribution of children's products. We believe that licensing the Joe's\u00ae and Hudson\u00ae brands for certain product categories will broaden and enhance the products available under these brand names. While our agreements with our licensees cover product design, product quality, sourcing, manufacturing, marketing and other requirements, our licensees may not comply fully with those agreements. Non-compliance could include marketing products under our brand names that do not meet our quality and other requirements or engaging in manufacturing practices that do not meet our standards. These activities could harm our brand equity, our reputation and our business.\nOur business will suffer if we fail to respond to changing customer tastes.\nCustomer tastes can change rapidly. We may not be able to anticipate, gauge or respond to these changes within a timely manner. We may also not be able to continue to satisfy our customers' existing tastes and preferences. If we misjudge the market for products or product groups, or if we fail to identify and respond appropriately to changing consumer demands, we may be faced with unsold\nfinished goods inventory, which could materially adversely affect expected operating results and decrease sales, gross margins and profitability.\nIf we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products to our stores and to wholesale partners.\nWe stock our stores, and provide inventory to our wholesale partners, based on our or their estimates of future demand for particular products. Our inventory management and planning team determines the number of pieces of each product that we will order from our manufacturers based upon past sales of similar products, sales trend information and anticipated demand at our suggested retail prices. However, if our inventory and planning team fails to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our inventory at a level appropriate for future customer demand.\nFactors that could affect our inventory management and planning team's ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products include:\n\u2022 a substantial increase or decrease in demand for our products or for products of our competitors;\n\u2022 our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products;\n\u2022 new product introductions or pricing strategies by competitors;\n\u2022 more limited historical store sales information for our newer markets;\n\u2022 weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in the future; and\n\u2022 acts or threats of war or terrorism which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or our international sales.\nBecause of our rapid growth, we have occasionally placed insufficient levels of desirable product with our wholesale partners and in our retail locations such that we were unable to fully satisfy customer demand at those locations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to match supply with demand in all cases in the future, whether as a result of our inability to produce sufficient levels of desirable product or our failure to forecast demand accurately. As a result of these inabilities or failures, we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventory at discount prices and may experience significant write-offs. Additionally, if we over-produce a product based on an aggressive forecast of demand, retailers may not be able to sell the product and cancel future orders or require give backs. These outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and adversely impact sales, gross margins and profitability.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by the financial health of our retail customers.\nWe sell our products primarily to retail and distribution companies around the world based on pre-qualified payment terms. Financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. We are dependent primarily on lines of credit that we establish from time to time with customers, and should a substantial number of customers become unable to pay to us their respective debts as they become due, we may be unable to collect some or all of the monies owed by those customers. In particular, because of the concentration of our customer and customer groups, our results of operations could be adversely affected if any one of these customers fails to satisfy its payments obligations to us when due.\nIn recent years, the retail industry has experienced consolidation, restructurings, reorganizations and other ownership changes that have resulted in one entity controlling several different stores or the elimination of stores. This consolidation can result in fewer customers for our products, the closing of some stores or the number of \"doors\" which carry our products. As a result, the potential for consolidation or ownership changes, closing of retail outlets and fewer customers could negatively impact sales of our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have grown rapidly in recent years as a result of the acquisition of Hudson and we have limited operating experience as a team at our current scale of operations. If we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our business results and financial performance may suffer.\nWe have expanded our operations rapidly since the acquisition of Hudson in 2013, and we have limited operating experience at our current size. Our business has grown significantly over the past few years, as we have grown our total net sales from $118,600,000 in fiscal 2012 to $188,755,000 in fiscal 2014. We have made and are making investments to support our near and longer-term growth. If our operations continue to grow over the longer term, of which there can be no assurance, we will be required to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes, and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarters personnel. Our continued growth and continuing integration of Hudson into our operations could strain our existing resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including obtaining sufficient raw materials at acceptable prices, securing manufacturing capacity to produce our products and experiencing delays in production and shipments. These difficulties would likely lead to a decrease in net revenue, income from operations and the price of our common stock.\nThe extent of our foreign sourcing may adversely affect our business.\nOur products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors located outside of the United States, with approximately 75 percent of our total revenue for fiscal 2014 attributable to manufacturing contractors located outside of the United States. These manufacturing contractors are located mainly in Mexico and Asia, with approximately 65 percent of our purchases for fiscal 2014 attributable to manufacturing contractors located in Mexico. We anticipate that the percentage of our total revenue for fiscal 2015 will increase because of our plan to shift a substantial portion of Hudson's denim production to Mexico. A manufacturing contractor's failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of the magnitude of our foreign sourcing, our business is subject to the following risks:\n\u2022 political and economic instability in countries or regions, including heightened terrorism and other security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional or more frequent inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods;\n\u2022 imposition of regulations, quotas and other trade restrictions relating to imports, including quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022 imposition of increased duties, taxes and other charges on imports;\n\u2022 labor union strikes at ports through which our products enter the United States;\n\u2022 labor shortages in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022 a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials;\n\u2022 restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries;\n\u2022 disease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas.\n\u2022 The migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or planned to be produced;\n\u2022 increases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation;\n\u2022 reduced manufacturing flexibility because of geographic distance between our foreign manufacturers and us, increasing the risk that we may have to mark down unsold inventory as a result of misjudging the market for a foreign-made product; and\n\u2022 violations by foreign contractors of labor and wage standards and resulting adverse publicity.\nIf these risks limit or prevent us from manufacturing products in any significant international market, prevent us from acquiring products from foreign suppliers, or significantly increase the cost of our products, our operations could be seriously disrupted until alternative suppliers are found or alternative markets are developed, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. As a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. Supply disruptions from this manufacturer (or any of our other manufacturers) could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands, if we are unable to source suitable replacement materials at acceptable prices or at all. Our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business could suffer as a result of a manufacturer's inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications or if we need to replace manufacturers.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture of all of our products. We enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produces our products exclusively. The inability of a certain manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the seasonality of our business, and the apparel and fashion business in particular, the dates on which customers need and require shipments of products from us are critical, as styles and consumer tastes change so rapidly in the apparel and fashion business, particularly from one season to the next. Further, because quality is a leading factor when customers and retailers accept or reject goods, any decline in quality by our third-party manufacturers could be detrimental not only to a particular order, but also to our future relationship with that particular customer.\nWe compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for production and import quota capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand\nour third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot assure you that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or similar to existing terms which we have with our manufacturers, either from a production standpoint or a financial standpoint.\nIncreases in the price of raw materials or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability.\nThe principal fabrics used in our business are cotton, blends, synthetics and wools. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for the raw materials-primarily cotton-used to produce them. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, work stoppages, government regulation, economic climates and other unpredictable factors. Increases in raw material costs, together with other factors, will make it difficult for us to sustain the level of cost of goods savings we have achieved in recent years and could result in a decrease of our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers. Moreover, any decrease in the availability of cotton could impair our ability to meet our production requirements in a timely manner.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with our vendors.\nWe purchase our raw materials, including fabric, yarns, threads and trims, such as zippers, buttons and tags from a variety of vendors. While we are not reliant exclusively on one or more particular vendor for the supply of the raw materials or component parts required to meet our manufacturing needs, we depend on our relationships and these vendors to ensure our supply of these raw materials or component parts. Any problems or disputes with these vendors could result in us having to source these raw materials or component parts from another vendor, which could delay production, and in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur an increase in costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nWe utilize systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, and others, including credit card information and personal identification information. A security breach may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly- evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nOur directors and management, including Mr. Dahan, beneficially own a large percentage of our common stock and may be able to exert significant influence and control over us and may make decisions that do not always coincide with the interest of other stockholders.\nAs of February 13, 2015, our executive officers and directors, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 20 percent of our common stock, including options exercisable and restricted common\nstock units vesting within 60 days. In particular, Mr. Dahan, an executive officer and member of our Board, beneficially owned approximately 17 percent of our total shares outstanding and is our largest stockholder. As a result, such persons are in a position to exert significant control over us and have the ability to substantially influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our stock option plans, and to control our management and affairs. Accordingly, such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to other stockholders.\nIn addition, as of February 13, 2015, Peter Kim, the Chief Executive Officer of our Hudson subsidiary and a member of our Board, owns approximately $14,300,000 in the aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, which would be convertible on September 30, 2015 into approximately 8,000,000 shares of our common stock, at the current conversion price, which would represent approximately 10 percent of our total shares outstanding.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract and retain talented personnel and retain our key employees, including our creative director.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented personnel. To date, we have not had any difficulty in attracting or retaining personnel to fill open or new positions, however, in the future, we may need to expand our infrastructure to support any anticipated growth. We may need to provide incentives, both short term and long term, to attract and retain personnel. Incentives can range from bonuses, grants of options or restricted stock to perquisites unique to the industry. All such incentives will result in an increase in certain expenses. More particularly, growth and payment of incentives to personnel and expenditures to expand our infrastructure to support our growth will cause our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase if we cannot maintain or decrease other expenses. An increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses may cause us to be less profitable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or decrease other expenses, therefore, a decrease in profit may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMr. Dahan's departure could materially adversely affect our operations because his experience, design capabilities and name recognition in the apparel industry is important to our business and we rely heavily on Mr. Dahan's capabilities to design, direct and produce product for the Joe's\u00ae brand. However, the loss of Mr. Dahan would not have any effect on our ownership of the brand. While we believe that we would be able to find a suitable replacement to design, direct and produce product for the Joe's\u00ae brand, we do not know the effect a new or different designer would have on the products and consumer's response to those new products. Therefore, the loss of Mr. Dahan's services could have an impact on our ability to operate on a daily basis.\nOur existing stockholders may be diluted if we choose to settle the convertible notes by issuing shares of our common stock.\nUnder the terms of the convertible notes issued in connection with the acquisition of Hudson, we choose how we settle the conversion of the notes. We can settle by issuing shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and common stock, at our election. Each of the notes is convertible, in whole but not in part, at a conversion price of $1.78 per share, subject to certain adjustments, into approximately 18,200,000 shares of our common stock. If we settle through the issuance of our common stock, this would result in a reduction of the percentage of ownership interest held by our existing stockholders. Also, the addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into\nthe market or the registration of any other securities may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nIn the event we seek additional capital through equity or debt offerings, our existing stockholders may be diluted or we may be unable to find additional capital on terms favorable to us and our stockholders. Furthermore, we may not be able to seek additional capital through equity or debt offerings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities.\nIn the event that we need additional working capital for our projected operations, we may seek capital through debt or equity offerings which could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and/or rights to acquire additional shares of our capital stock. In addition, we are restricted in our ability to seek capital through debt or equity offerings from our lenders under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. Any additional issuances of capital stock would result in a reduction of the percentage of ownership interest held by our existing stockholders. Also, the addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market or the registration of any other securities may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock. Finally, we may not be able to find additional capital on terms favorable to us or obtain the consent of our lenders to permit us to do so through existing markets or investors due to market conditions, our historical performance or our stock price.\nOur common stock price is volatile and may decrease.\nThe trading price and volume of our common stock has historically been subject to fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022 annual and quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u2022 operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of other denim apparel companies;\n\u2022 announcements of new product lines by us or our competitors, announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or dispositions of assets, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel or members of our board of directors; and\n\u2022 general conditions in the apparel industry.\nIn the 52 week period prior to the filing of this Annual Report, the closing price of our common stock has ranged from $0.30 to $1.55. In addition, stock markets generally have experienced price and volume trading volatility in recent years. This volatility has had an effect on the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are currently not in compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing. Since we are not in compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirements, we may be delisted, which may decrease our stock price and make it harder for our stockholders to trade our stock and would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and harm our business.\nOn November 24, 2014, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we no longer met Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), or the\nBid Price Rule, because the minimum bid price of our common stock did not equal or exceed $1.00 at least once over a period of 30 consecutive trading days prior to the date of the notification letter. According to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were afforded 180 calendar days until May 26, 2015, with one additional 180 calendar day extension period, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. However, if we are not able to regain compliance in the applicable time period, Nasdaq will provide written notification to us that our common stock would be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nWhile we intend to monitor the bid price of our common stock and consider available options if our common stock does not trade at a level likely to result in us regaining compliance with the Bid Price Rule by May 26, 2015, or within any applicable extension period, no assurances can be made that we will in fact be able to comply and that our common stock will remain listed on Nasdaq. If we are not able to comply with the Nasdaq requirements, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and our common stock would likely be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the OTC Pink Sheets. As a consequence of any such delisting, a stockholder would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the prices of our common stock. Also, a delisting of our common stock would adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and harm our business.\nThe seasonal nature of our business makes management more difficult, severely reduces cash flow and liquidity during parts of the year and could force us to curtail our operations.\nOur business is seasonal. The majority of our marketing and sales activities take place from late fall to early spring. Historically, our greatest volume of shipments and sales occur from late spring through the early fall, which coincides with our third and fourth fiscal quarters. This requires us to build-up inventories during our first and second fiscal quarters when our cash flow is weakest. Historically speaking, our cash flow is strongest in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Unfavorable economic conditions affecting retailers during the fall and holiday seasons in any year could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year. We are likely to experience periods of negative cash flow throughout each year, including, a drop-off in business commencing each December, which could force us to curtail operations if adequate liquidity is not available. We cannot assure you that the effects of such seasonality will diminish in the future. For fiscal 2014, we funded inventory purchases through cash from operations and cash availability under our financing agreements with CIT.\nIf an independent manufacturer of ours fails to use acceptable labor practices, our business could suffer.\nWhile we require our independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we have no control over the ultimate actions of our independent manufacturers. Despite our lack of control, we have internal and vendor operating guidelines to promote ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers. We also use the services of a third party independent labor consulting service to conduct on site audits as required by state labor laws to help minimize our risk and exposure to unacceptable labor practice violations. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the laws governing garment manufacturers in the State of California impose joint liability upon us and our independent manufacturers for the labor practices of those independent manufacturers. As a result, should one of our independent manufacturers be found in violation of state labor laws, we could suffer financial or other unforeseen consequences.\nOur trademark and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected and some of our products are targets of counterfeiting.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We may, however, experience conflict with various third parties who acquire or claim ownership rights in certain trademarks as we expand our product offerings and expand the number of countries where we sell our products. We cannot ensure that the actions we have taken to establish and protect these trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights. Also, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nOur products are sometimes the target of counterfeiters. As a result, there are often products that are imitations or \"knock-offs\" of our products that can be found in the marketplace or consumers can find products that are confusingly similar to ours. We intend to continue to vigorously defend our trademarks and products bearing our trademarks, however, we cannot assure you that our efforts will be adequate to prosecute and block all sales of infringing products from the marketplace.\nOur ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.\nOur ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations. Some of these risks include:\n\u2022 the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022 new tariffs or other barriers to some international markets.\nWe are also subject to general political and economic risks associated with conducting international business, including:\n\u2022 political instability;\n\u2022 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u2022 general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.\nWe cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the United States, Mexico, the European Union, Canada, China, Japan, India, South Korea or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in regulatory or geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect our business in the future or may require us to modify our current business practices.", "PERMNO": 76858, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "CTRCQ"}
