{"cik": "896264", "company": "USANA HEALTH SCIENCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to and encounter various substantial risks and events that adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and the price of our common stock. You should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly under the heading \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d on page 1, and the disclosures contained in Part I, \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d and Part II, \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this report, as well as in the other filings we make from time to time with the SEC, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our business.\nGlobal Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue and may adversely affect our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including the spread of new variants of the virus, has negatively impacted our business in various markets around the world and continues to present an unpredictable operating environment for us in many of our markets. To address the pandemic, many governments have issued various restrictive orders that affect businesses and consumers. Government-imposed restrictions, health and safety mandated best practices, and public hesitance regarding in-person gatherings have reduced our ability and the ability of our Associates to hold sales meetings, required our associates to share and sell our products in a predominantly virtual environment, resulted in cancellations of key Company events and trips, required us to utilize a work-from-home strategy for all non-manufacturing and non-distribution employees, and required us to temporarily close our walk-in and fulfillment locations we maintain in some markets. The pandemic has also affected the availability and cost of various of our raw materials, packaging materials and shipping resources to transport our product to our various markets around the world. Our supply chain and logistics have incurred some disruption and we could experience more significant disruptions or face more significant closures in the future as the pandemic continues. These factors and others related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the spread of new variants of the virus, will likely continue to negatively affect our business and our financial results in a number of ways. The situation around the world with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and change rapidly, and uncertainty regarding its duration and future impact continues to exist.\nA meaningful decline in our future operating results could also adversely affect our financial position, capital resources and liquidity. While we have not persistently drawn or maintained a standing balance on our Credit Facility, we are subject to certain financial covenants and leverage ratios under the Credit Facility. A significant decline in our future operating results because of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar health epidemic or pandemic event, could affect our ability to comply with our covenants and other obligations under our Credit Facility, which could result in an event of default under the terms of our Credit Facility. An event of default under our Credit Facility could result in our inability to access funding under the facility and repayment acceleration of any outstanding balances under the facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur results of operations could also be negatively impacted if the reality or fear of another communicable and rapidly spreading disease, health crisis, or natural disaster results in business interruption, travel restrictions or avoidance of public gatherings in one or more of our markets. It is difficult to predict the impact on our business, if any, of the emergence of new epidemics or other crises.\nRisk Associated with Direct Selling\nDirect selling is subject to intense government scrutiny, and regulation and changes in the law, or the interpretation and enforcement of the law, might adversely affect our business.\nVarious laws and regulations in the United States and other countries regulate direct selling. These laws and regulations exist at many levels of government in many different forms, are inherently fact-based, and often do not include \u201cbright line\u201d rules. We are also subject to the risk that the laws and regulations, or a regulator\u2019s interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations, could change. From time to time, we have received requests to supply information regarding our business to regulatory agencies. We have also been required to modify our Compensation Plan in certain jurisdictions to comply with the interpretation of the regulations by local authorities. We obtain regulatory approval of our Compensation Plan when required or, when not required, we may seek a legal opinion regarding compliance. We may also be prohibited from distributing products through direct selling or paying multilevel compensation in some countries.\nIn the United States, the FTC has actively warned various direct selling companies and the industry as a whole about certain business practices associated with direct selling and entered into settlements with several direct selling companies that required those companies to modify their compensation plans and business models. Those settlements resulted from FTC enforcement actions brought by the FTC involving a variety of alleged violations of consumer protection laws, including misleading earnings representations and legal compliance of those companies\u2019 business models and distributor compensation plans. For example, in 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement with another direct selling company following an enforcement action in which the FTC alleged that the company\u2019s distributors were making misleading earnings representations and that the company was utilizing an illegal business model. Also in 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement with another direct selling company following an enforcement action in which the FTC alleged that the company\u2019s distributors had made misleading income representations and that the company was utilizing an unfair and deceptive compensation plan. In September 2019, the FTC entered into a settlement with a direct selling company following an FTC enforcement action, which included the alleged violations noted above. Pursuant to this settlement, the company is permanently prohibited from using a multilevel compensation plan in the United States. Following this settlement, the FTC initiated litigation with another direct selling company for similar alleged violations and is seeking similar remedies, including a prohibition of multilevel compensation in the U.S. In 2020, the FTC sent warning letters to several direct-selling companies regarding product and/or income claims that the companies and/or their distributor sales forces were making related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Settlements, such as those described in the cases described above, may require a direct selling company to pay a significant fine, revise its U.S. business model and compensation plan to comply with various restrictions on how it can compensate independent distributors and change its marketing practices to avoid misleading product or income representations, among other things. Although a settlement between the FTC and a specific company does not generally have force of law or binding effect on other companies, FTC officials have indicated that the direct selling industry should look to these consent orders, and the principles contained therein, for guidance.\nIn October 2021, the FTC, pursuant to its Penalty Offense Authority under the FTC Act, sent letters to over 1,100 companies, including USANA, warning them that the FTC could seek penalties of up to $43,792 per violation for conduct determined to be unfair, deceptive, or otherwise unlawful in certain prior FTC actions. The letter did not accuse any recipient company, including USANA, of engaging in unlawful conduct. But if the FTC later alleges that we have engaged in acts or practices found to be unfair, deceptive, or unlawful in the actions referenced in the letters, we could be at risk of penalties and other potential liability. We regularly analyze our business model in response to settlements between the FTC and other direct selling companies, as well as guidance and other communications issued by the FTC, and from time to time we refine aspects of our business model where appropriate. Although we strive to ensure that our business model and compensation plan are compliant with applicable laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, in each of our markets, we cannot assure you that a regulator, if it were to review our business, would agree with our assessment and would not require us to change one or more aspects of our operations. Any action against us in the future by the FTC or another regulator could materially and adversely affect our operations.\nThe FTC is currently advocating and considering certain legal and regulatory changes that, if implemented, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, the FTC has formally asked Congress to pass legislation that would allow the FTC to recover monetary redress for consumers pursuant to Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. The FTC is also currently reviewing the Business Opportunity Rule, which according to the FTC requires business opportunity sellers to give prospective buyers specific information to help them evaluate a business opportunity, thus ensuring that the prospective purchasers have the information they need in order to assess the risks of buying a work-at-home program or any other business opportunity. Direct sellers like USANA are currently exempt from the Business Opportunity Rule, but the FTC could include direct sellers within the scope of the rule as a result of the review. If direct sellers become subject to the Business Opportunity Rule, we will have to comply with disclosure requirements that could significantly increase the cost of doing business and have other material adverse effects on our business.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future law, regulation, or guidance, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations, judicial decisions, or administrative orders would have on our business. Failure by us, or our Associates, to comply with these laws, regulations, or guidance, could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general. Finally, the continuation of regulatory challenges, investigations and litigation against other direct selling companies could harm our business and industry if the laws and regulations are interpreted in a way that results in additional restrictions on direct selling companies in general.\nThe violation of marketing or advertising laws by Associates in connection with the sale of our products or the improper promotion of our Compensation Plan could adversely affect our business.\nAll Associates contractually agree to adhere to our policies. Although these policies prohibit Associates from making false, misleading and other improper claims regarding products or income potential from the sale of the products, from time to time Associates, without our knowledge and in violation of our policies, create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe USANA, our products or the Compensation Plan. They also may make statements regarding potential earnings, product claims, or other matters in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations concerning these matters. These violations may result in legal action against us in our various markets by regulatory agencies, state attorneys general, or private parties - and in China by the Chinese government. Legal actions against us or our Associates or others who are associated with us could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business, including our business model. We take what we believe to be commercially reasonable steps to (i) regularly train our active Associate base and (ii) monitor the activities of our Associates to guard against misrepresentation and other illegal or unethical conduct by Associates and to assure compliance with our policies. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts in this regard will be sufficient to accomplish this objective. Adverse publicity resulting from such activities could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain Associates and Preferred Customers and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may have or could incur obligations relating to the activities of our Associates.\nOur Associates are subject to taxation, and, in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies may impose an obligation on us to collect taxes, such as sales taxes or value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate records of such transactions. In addition, we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes as well as employee benefits with respect to our Associates. In particular, the laws regarding independent contractor status in certain jurisdictions, including the United States, continue to evolve and, in some cases, authorities have sought to apply these laws unfavorably against gig economy, platform and direct selling companies, including USANA. In 2020, we were named as a defendant in a private lawsuit in California by a plaintiff\u2019s firm that is seeking to reclassify our California Associates from independent contractors to employees under California state law. While we do not believe this litigation is material to our business, and we believe we have legally and appropriately classified our Associates as independent contractors, it is possible that this lawsuit or potential future laws, could negatively impact the independent contractor status of our Associates or distributors in direct selling companies in general. If federal, state or local laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations change to require us to treat our Associates as employees, or if our Associates are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors, under existing laws and interpretations, we may be deemed to be responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees, including social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions, wages, employee benefits, plus any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur Associate Compensation Plan, or changes we make to it, may be viewed negatively by some Associates, could fail to achieve our desired objectives, and could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, we modify our Compensation Plan to (i) keep it competitive and attractive, (ii) cause or address a change in Associate behavior, (iii) conform to legal and regulatory requirements, or (iv) address other business needs. It is difficult to predict how any changes to the plan will be viewed by Associates and whether such changes will achieve their desired results. There can be no assurance that changes to our Associate Compensation Plan will allow us to successfully attract new Associates or retain existing Associates, nor can we assure that any changes we make to our Compensation Plan will achieve our desired results. Additionally, the payment of Associate incentives under our Compensation Plan is our most significant expense. Modifying our Compensation Plan directly affects the incentives we pay as a percentage of net sales. There can be no assurance that changes to the Compensation Plan will be successful in achieving target levels of Associate incentives as a percentage of net sales. Furthermore, such changes may make it difficult to attract and retain qualified and motivated Associates.\nRisks Related to Our China Business\nOur Greater China region accounts for a significant part of our business and expected growth. A decline in sales or customers in this region would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Greater China region consists of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and has been our largest region for sales over the last several years and China has been our largest market. Our international growth strategy has focused largely on growing our China business. In 2019, our sales and active Customer counts in both the Greater China region and our China market declined, largely because of a challenging operating environment in China. Additionally, throughout 2021, and 2020, health officials in Greater China continued to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, which also created a challenging environment for our business in China. If we are not successful in continuing to grow BabyCare\u2019s sales and customer base in China, our consolidated growth as a company will be negatively affected and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be harmed. BabyCare must comply with significant operational, financial, and other regulatory requirements to engage in direct selling in China. Although we believe that we will be successful in growing BabyCare\u2019s business in China, it is difficult to assess the extent to which BabyCare\u2019s business model and compensation plan will be successful or deemed to be compliant with applicable Chinese laws and regulations. In light of the factors listed above, and the other risks to our business, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing to increase sales and customers in China through BabyCare.\nOur operations in China are subject to significant government regulation, as well as a variety of legal, political, and economic risks. If the Chinese government modifies its direct selling laws and regulations, or interprets and enforces these laws and regulations in a manner that is adverse to our business in China, our consolidated business and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nOur operations in China are conducted by BabyCare, our China subsidiary. BabyCare operates in China pursuant to direct selling laws and regulations that are uncertain and evolving. These regulations contain a number of financial and operational restrictions for direct selling companies, including prohibitions on pyramid selling and multi-level compensation. The laws and regulations are also subject to discretionary interpretation and enforcement by various state, provincial and municipal level officials in China. Regulators in China may modify current direct selling laws and regulations or change how they interpret and enforce them. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Chinese government\u2019s current or future interpretation and application of existing and new regulations will not negatively impact our business in China, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties against us or our Associates.\nThe Chinese government also exercises significant control over the Chinese economy, including through controlling capital, foreign currency exchange, foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, providing preferential treatment to certain industry segments or companies and issuing required licenses to conduct business. We could face additional risks resulting from changes in China\u2019s data privacy and security requirements. Accordingly, any adverse change in the Chinese governmental, economic or other policies could have a material adverse effect on BabyCare\u2019s business in China and our consolidated results of operations.\nAlthough BabyCare utilizes a business model that has been developed specifically for China\u2019s laws and regulations, the Chinese government has not approved BabyCare\u2019s model, compensation plan, and operations.\nBabyCare\u2019s business model has been designed specifically for China\u2019s laws and regulations based on, among other things, BabyCare\u2019s (i) communications with the Chinese government, (ii) interpretation of the direct selling laws and regulations, as well as its understanding of how the government interprets and enforces the regulations, and (iii) understanding of how other multinational direct selling companies operate in China. Many of the components of BabyCare\u2019s business model are unique to China and are not part of our business model in our markets outside of China. For example, BabyCare sells products in China through a variety of methods, including: (a) online through its website; (b) at physical branch retail locations in China; (c) through direct sellers in provinces and municipalities where BabyCare has received a direct sales license; and (d) through independent distributors who are considered independent business owners under Chinese law. BabyCare has not received confirmation from the Chinese government that its business model and operations in China comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those pertaining to direct selling. We cannot assure that Chinese regulatory authorities would deem BabyCare's business model, compensation plan or the activities of its employees, direct sellers or independent distributors to be compliant with current or future laws and regulations. If BabyCare\u2019s model were deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations, as they are now or may in the future be interpreted or enforced, BabyCare could be subject to fines, penalties or suspension of its business in China or, ultimately, have its direct selling license revoked by the Chinese government, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business in China.\nBabyCare\u2019s operations in China, and direct selling companies in general, are subject to significant government oversight, scrutiny and monitoring.\nChinese regulators regularly monitor and make inquiries about the business activities of direct sellers in China and have done so with BabyCare. For example, following adverse media coverage of certain health product companies and direct selling companies in 2019, several departments of the Chinese government, including SAMR, MPS, and MOFCOM, initiated a review of health product and direct selling companies in China. The review required applicable companies such as BabyCare to conduct a self-assessment of the regulatory compliance of their business and to provide information to the government regarding the same. The review also entailed a review of a company\u2019s regulatory compliance by various departments of the Chinese government. During this review, the Chinese government, among other things, (i) instructed direct selling companies not to hold large distributor meetings, and (ii) suspended its application review process for direct sales licenses and authorizations. The Chinese government has yet to re-open the application review process for direct sales licenses and authorizations or indicate if or when it plans to do so.\nDirect selling regulations in China prevent persons who are not Chinese nationals from engaging in direct selling in China. We have implemented internal policies that are designed to promote our Associates\u2019 compliance with these regulations, however, we cannot guarantee that any of our Associates residing outside of China or any of BabyCare\u2019s Associates in China have not engaged or will not engage in activities that violate our policies in this market or that violate Chinese law or other applicable laws and regulations, which might result in regulatory action and adverse publicity and potential harm to our business in China.\nThe Chinese government has investigated and imposed significant fines on companies and their distributors believed to have violated direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations. In some cases, it has even shut such companies down. There have been instances where inquiries or complaints about BabyCare\u2019s business have resulted in warnings from the Chinese government as well as the payment of fines by BabyCare. We expect that BabyCare will continue to face the risk of government inquiries, complaints or investigations. Any determination that BabyCare\u2019s business or the activities of its Associates are not in compliance with applicable regulations could result in additional fines, disruption of business, or the suspension or termination of BabyCare\u2019s licenses, including its direct selling licenses, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. There can be no assurance that the Chinese government\u2019s interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations will not negatively impact BabyCare\u2019s business, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties against BabyCare, USANA or our Associates in China.\nBabyCare must apply for and receive government approval to expand its business in China and the failure to obtain such approvals could negatively impact its ability to expand and grow its business.\nBabyCare has obtained direct selling licenses in certain provinces and municipalities and it must obtain various licenses and approvals from additional municipalities and provinces within China if it is to operate its direct selling business model in China. Although direct selling licenses are centrally issued, the licenses are generally valid only in the jurisdictions within which related approvals have been obtained. Those approvals are generally awarded on local and provincial bases, and the approval process requires involvement of multiple ministries at each level.\nBabyCare also will be required to obtain licenses from municipalities and provinces within China where it currently does not hold a license. The Chinese government has not yet reopened its application review process for direct sales licenses and approvals since suspending the process in 2019. If BabyCare is unable to obtain additional direct selling licenses and approvals as quickly as we would like, or at all, it would negatively impact our ability to expand and grow our business in China. Ultimately, there can be no assurance that BabyCare will be successful in maintaining its current direct selling licenses or obtaining additional direct selling licenses or the required approvals to expand into additional locations in China that are important to its business.\nRisk Associated with Our International Operations\nRisks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects, and failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-bribery laws could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently conduct our business in various foreign countries, and we expect to expand the number of countries in which we operate in the future. Economic conditions, including those resulting from wars, civil unrest, political unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global markets, may adversely affect our customers, their demand for our products and their ability to pay for our products. In addition, there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally, including, but not limited to, potential instability in international markets, changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations, currency fluctuations in foreign countries, political, economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex U.S. and foreign laws and treaties, including tax laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and the Bribery Act of 2010 (\u201cU.K. Anti-Bribery Act\u201d). In recent years, there have been an increasing number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws, including a voluntary investigation we recently concluded concerning our China operations. The FCPA prohibits U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Anti-Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption and in certain circumstances compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. Further, we require our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with these and other anti-bribery laws.\nAlthough we have policies and procedures and a compliance program designed to ensure that we comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for violations of these acts (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could incur severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of these acts is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management.\nWe believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to grow in our existing international markets or enter new international markets on a timely basis, or that new markets will be profitable. We must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any international market. In addition, before marketing commences in a new country or market, it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country. In addition to significant regulatory barriers, we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere. We may be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country. Once we have entered a market, we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully reformulate our products in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or to attract local customers. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals in new markets or that we will have sufficient capital to finance our expansion efforts in a timely manner.\nIn many market areas, other direct selling companies already have significant market penetration, the effect of which could be to desensitize the local population to a new opportunity, such as USANA, or to make it more difficult for us to attract qualified Associates or sell to customers generally. Even if we are able to commence operations in new markets, there may not be a sufficient population of persons who are interested in our business. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to integrate our Compensation Plan seamlessly across all markets where legally permissible. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to utilize our Compensation Plan seamlessly in all existing or future markets.\nTrade policies, disputes, tariffs or other international disputes could harm our business and operating results.\nTrade policies and actions which have been, or in the future may be, implemented by the United States against other countries, including China, relating to the import and export of certain products, and negotiations with respect thereto, may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations in China and other markets. There have been consistent, ongoing discussions and activities that raise concern in this regard.\nAdditionally, any actions taken by the Chinese government, or the government in our other markets, to implement further trade policy changes, financial restrictions, or increased regulatory scrutiny on U.S. companies could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For instance, China has previously taken or threatened to take trade and other actions in retaliation against U.S. policies, and is likely to continue to do so. Past or future developments in this regard may have a material adverse effect on the economies, financial markets, and currency exchange rates in China and the United States.\nTensions between the United States and China have increased over the past few years as a result of disputes in areas including trade policy, intellectual property, cybersecurity and data privacy. China is our largest market and the United States is one of our largest markets and the location of our corporate headquarters. Our business could be harmed if relations between the United States and China worsen or if either government imposes additional policies, tariffs or sanctions and our business could encounter increased regulatory scrutiny in China, as well as adverse media or public attention in China, as a result of the deteriorating bilateral relationship. Many experts believe that the bilateral relationship between these two countries may worsen before any improvements are seen, with 2022 an important political year in both countries: both the U.S. mid-term elections and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s 20th Party Congress are scheduled for Fall 2022.\nFluctuation in the value of currency exchange rates with the U.S. dollar affects our operations and our net sales and earnings.\nFor the year ended January 1, 2022, 90.7% of our total net sales were generated in markets outside of the United States. Consequently, exchange rate fluctuations have, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our sales and earnings. If exchange rates fluctuate dramatically, it may become uneconomical for us to establish or to continue activities in certain countries. For instance, changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our competitors sell similar products in the same market. As our business expands outside the United States, an increasing share of our net sales and operating costs is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accounting practices require that our non-U.S. financial results be converted to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Consequently, our reported net earnings may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, with earnings generally increasing with a weaker U.S. dollar and decreasing with a strengthening U.S. dollar. Currently our strategy for reducing our exposure to currency fluctuation includes the timely and efficient repatriation of earnings from international markets where such earnings are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested, and settlement of intercompany transactions. We also enter into currency exchange contracts to offset foreign currency exposure in various international markets. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. A foreign government may impose, and some have imposed, foreign currency remittance restrictions. For example, several markets in which we conduct business, including China, require that we file the necessary statutory financial statements for the relevant period as a prerequisite to repatriating cash in the form of a dividend. Any government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our operating results or cash flows from potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations. Any such adverse effects could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Products, Manufacturing and Operations\nOur products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could limit or prevent the sale of our products in some markets.\nThe manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the United States and other countries, including the FDA and the FTC. Failure to comply with FDA regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, and criminal prosecutions. Any action of this type by the FDA could materially adversely affect our ability to market our products successfully. The manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the United States requires compliance with dietary supplement GMPs, which are based on the food-model GMPs, with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements. We believe our manufacturing processes comply with these GMPs for dietary supplements. Nevertheless, any FDA action determining that our processes were non-compliant with dietary supplement GMPs, could materially adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products. In addition, the Dietary Supplement & Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires manufacturers of dietary supplement and over-the-counter products to notify the FDA when they receive reports of serious adverse events occurring within the United States. Potential FDA responses to any such report could include injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, or criminal prosecutions. We have an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years and believe that we comply with this new law. Nevertheless, any action by the FDA in response to a serious adverse event report that may be filed by us could materially and adversely affect our ability to market our products successfully.\nIn markets outside the United States, prior to commencing operations or marketing our products, we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses, or certifications from a country\u2019s ministry of health or a comparable agency. Approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. These activities are also subject to regulation by various agencies of the countries in which our products are sold.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. These potential effects could include, however, requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional record keeping and reporting requirements, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur in-house manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks.\nWe manufacture approximately 63% of the products sold to our customers. Additionally, our strategy over the past several years is to begin self-manufacturing our foods, personal care and skincare products, which will further increase the percentage of products we manufacture in-house. Because of our self-manufacturing practices, we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities. Those operations are subject to power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies, including the FDA and CFDA. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facilities would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals, solid and hazardous waste, and other toxic and hazardous materials. Our manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances. Nevertheless, complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations, or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Environmental laws and regulations require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits, authorizations, and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes. Violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured. The combined costs of curing incidents of non-compliance, resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities, or of satisfying new legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur reliance on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe contract with third-party suppliers and manufacturers for the production of certain of our products, which accounted for approximately 37% of our product sales for the year ended January 1, 2022. These third-party suppliers and manufacturers produce and, in most cases, package the products according to formulations and specifications that have been developed by or in conjunction with our in-house product development team. These products include most of our gelatin-capsulated supplements, Rev3 Energy Drink, Probiotic, our powdered drink mixes, and certain of our personal care products, including our Celavive products. Products manufactured by third-party suppliers at their locations must also pass through quality control and assurance procedures to ensure they are manufactured in conformance with our specifications. We cannot assure you that our outside contract manufacturers will continue to reliably supply products to us at the levels of quality, or the quantities, we require, and in compliance with our specifications or applicable laws, including under the FDA\u2019s GMP regulations. We have encountered situations in the past where we have had disagreements with contract manufacturers about the overall quality of products they have produced for us, and specifically whether such products conform to our specifications. We have also suspended and terminated relationships with contract manufacturers for quality issues and non-conforming products. While our business continuation plan contemplates events such as these, identifying and obtaining acceptable replacement manufacturing sources, on a timely basis or at all, is challenging. Additionally, transferring our third-party manufacturing business to another contract manufacturer can be expensive, time-consuming, result in delays in our production or shipping, reduce our net sales, damage our relationship with customers and damage our reputation in the marketplace.\nThe inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nWe acquire all of our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third-party suppliers. Materials used in manufacturing our products are purchased through purchase order, often invoking pre-negotiated annual supply agreements. We have very few long-term agreements for the supply of these materials. There is a risk that any of our suppliers could discontinue selling raw materials to us. Although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our products, any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages or back orders for products, with a resulting loss of net sales. In certain situations, we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different products from another source. There can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials that are needed by us in the quantities that we request or at the prices that we are willing to pay. Because we do not control the actual production of certain raw materials, we are also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials, based on conditions not within our control, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, strikes by supplier employees, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nIn the past, we have experienced temporary shortages of the raw materials used in certain of our nutritional products. Although we had identified multiple sources to supply such raw material ingredients, quantities of the materials we purchased during these shortages were at higher prices, which had a negative impact on our gross margins for those products. While we periodically experience price increases due to unexpected raw material shortages and other unanticipated events, we have been able to manage this by increasing the price at which we sell our products, therefore, this has historically not resulted in a material effect on our gross margin. Supply chain interruptions, including as a result of shortages and transportation issues or unexpected increases in demand, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and Associates, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, Associates or us. Any of these events, if they were to occur, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDelays and disruptions to transporting and distributing our products may adversely affect our results.\nWe may experience delays and disruptions in shipping, transporting and otherwise distributing our products, including increased airport and shipping port congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased expenses, import or export controls or delays, and labor disputes or shortages. Disruptions in transportation and shipments may result in increased costs, including the additional use of airfreight to meet demand. Congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs and reduction in our profitability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in several delays, cost increases, and disruptions in our global distribution channel.\nWe may incur liability with respect to our products.\nAs a manufacturer and a distributor of products for human consumption and topical application, we could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation. Additionally, the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. To date, we have not been a party to any product liability litigation, although, like any dietary supplement company, we have received reports from individuals who have asserted that they suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our products. The number of reports we have received to date is nominal. These matters historically have been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments. We are aware of no instance in which any of our products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims. Although we maintain product liability insurance, which we believe to be adequate for our needs, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to such claims in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate.\nNutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies.\nOur products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption. Some of our products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients. Although we believe that all of our products are safe when taken as directed, there is little long-term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form. We conduct research and test the formulation and production of our products, but we have performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies. Furthermore, because we are highly dependent on consumers\u2019 perception of the efficacy, safety, and quality of our products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies, we could be adversely affected in the event that those products prove or are asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with any illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers\u2019 use or misuse of our products or similar products of our competitors.\nLegal, Regulatory, Compliance and Tax Risks\nLegal action by former Associates or third parties against us could harm our business.\nWe continually monitor and review our Associates\u2019 compliance with our policies and procedures as well the laws and regulations applicable to our business. In the ordinary course of our business, Associates occasionally fail to adhere to our policies and procedures. If this happens, we may take disciplinary action against the breaching Associate. This disciplinary action is based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case and may include anything from warnings for minor violations to termination of the Associate\u2019s purchase and distribution rights for more serious violations. From time to time, we become involved in litigation with an Associate whose purchase and distribution rights have been terminated. We consider this type of litigation to be routine and incidental to our business. While neither the existence nor the outcome of this type of litigation is typically material to our business, in the past we have been involved in litigation of this nature that resulted in a large cash award against us. Our competitors have also been involved in this type of litigation, and more and more of these cases have resulted in class action litigation, where the result has been a large cash award against the competitor or a large cash settlement by the competitor. These types of challenges, awards or settlements could provide incentives for similar actions by other former Associates against us in the future, which could result in class action litigation against us. Any such challenge involving others in our industry or us, could harm our business by resulting in fines or damages against us, creating adverse publicity about us or our industry, or hurting our ability to attract and retain customers. We believe that Associate compliance is critical to the integrity of our business, and, therefore, we will continue to be assertive in ensuring that our Associates comply with our policies and procedures. As such, there can be no assurance that this type of litigation will not occur again in the future or result in an award or settlement that has a materially adverse effect on our business. We could also be subject to challenges by private parties in civil actions. We are aware of recent civil litigation against various direct selling companies in the United States, which have already resulted in settlements and may result in additional significant settlements in the future by these companies. There can be no assurance that we will not be challenged by private parties in litigation.\nWe may incur liability under our \u201cAthlete Guarantee\u201d program.\nWe believe that our nutritional supplement products are free from substances that have been banned by world-class training and competitive athletic programs. We retain independent testing agencies to conduct periodic checks for banned substances. We further believe that, while our products promote good health, they are not otherwise considered \u201cperformance enhancing\u201d as that term has been used in defining substances that are banned from use in international competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency (\u201cWADA\u201d). For many years, we have been a sponsor of Olympic level athletes and professional competitors around the world. These athletes have been tested on many occasions and have never tested positive for banned substances as a result of taking USANA nutritional products. To back up our claim that athletes who use USANA products as part of their training regimen will not be consuming banned substances, we have offered to enter into agreements with select athletes, some of whom have high-profiles and are highly compensated. These agreements provide that, during the term of the agreement, should the athlete test positive for a banned substance included in the WADA, and should such positive result be caused by taking USANA nutritional products, we will compensate that athlete at an amount equal to two times their current annual earnings, up to $1.0 million dollars, based on the athlete\u2019s personal level of competition, endorsement, and other income, as well as other factors. Although we believe that the pool of current and potential participants in the program is small and that the procedures and safeguards implemented by us in connection with the program are sound, there is no guarantee that an athlete who is accepted in the program will not successfully make a claim against us. We currently have no insurance to protect us from potential claims under this program.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations in the United States and numerous other foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may change, with or without notice, due to social, economic, political and other considerations. As a result, our evaluation and estimates for our provision for income taxes may change perhaps negatively. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the market mix for our net sales, the amount of our earnings and where earned, intercompany transactions, the inability to realize tax benefits, changes in currency exchange rates, tax positions, allocation and apportionment of state taxes, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in our business operations, acquisitions, and entry into new markets. There can be no assurance that additional changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the United States and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to examination by tax authorities, including state revenue agencies and foreign governments. While we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from examinations by tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that the actual outcome resulting from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. The IRS and several foreign tax authorities have also increasingly focused attention on intercompany transfer pricing. Tax authorities, in certain instances, have disagreed with our transfer pricing calculations and agreements and assessed us with additional taxes. Going forward, tax authorities could continue to disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. If we do not prevail in any such disagreements, our profitability may be affected. Tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could negatively impact our business.\nWe are required by federal securities laws to document and test our internal control over financial reporting and are required to have management annually assess the effectiveness of such internal controls. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we fail to maintain effective internal controls we could be required to take costly and time-consuming corrective measures, to remedy any number of deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, be required to restate the affected historical financial statements, be subjected to investigations and/or sanctions by federal and state securities regulators, and be subjected to civil lawsuits by security holders. Any of the foregoing could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and in our company and would likely result in a decline in the market price of our stock and in our ability to raise additional financing if needed in the future.\nRisk Associated with Information Technology, Data Security and Data Privacy\nA failure of our information technology systems would harm our business.\nThe global nature of our business and our seamless global compensation plan requires the development and implementation of robust and efficiently functioning information technology systems. Such systems are vulnerable to a variety of potential risks, including damage or interruption resulting from natural disasters and telecommunication failures and human error or intentional acts of sabotage, vandalism, break-ins and similar acts. Although we have adopted and implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, which includes routine back-up, off-site archiving and storage, and certain redundancies, the occurrence of any of these events could result in costly interruptions or failures adversely affecting our business and the results of our operations.\nWe rely on information technology to support our operations and reporting environments. A data security failure involving that technology or the data stored in it, could disrupt our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results and our reputation, and expose us to potential liability or litigation. Likewise, a data breach at USANA could lead to significant liability and reputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of our global business, we collect and store in our data centers and on our networks significant amounts of data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, personally identifiable information (some of which is sensitive) and payment card information of our active Customers and employees. The secure processing and, when appropriate, deletion of this information is critical to our operations, regulatory compliance and business strategy. Although we strive to frequently analyze and improve our data security measures, our information technology and infrastructure are subject to persistent attacks of varying degrees and types and we may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers. Such attacks could include viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, or phishing schemes. Our systems could also be breached due to a cyber-incident, or we could be negatively impacted by a natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error, telecommunications system failure, service provider or vendor error or failure, or employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. In some instances, it could take us some time to discover that we have fallen victim to such a breach.\nAny such breach of our networks and the information therein could cause such information to be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered, damaged, held ransom, lost or stolen. In any such event, we could suffer significant loss or incur significant liability, including: damage to our reputation; increased cyber insurance premiums; loss of customer confidence or goodwill; and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate the resulting damage (including notification and credit monitoring costs, as well as fines and penalties imposed by regulators) to affected individuals or business partners, or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings, by affected individuals, business partners or regulators. Likewise, a failure to adhere to the payment card industry\u2019s data security standards could lead to significant penalties from payment card associations, termination of our ability to receive credit or debit card payments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, such data breach could result in significant disruption of our operations, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and data security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPersonal privacy and data security are significant for us in all of our markets because we collect, store and transmit significant amounts of company, employee, and active Customer personal information, including personally identifiable information and payment card information, for business purposes, including for transactional and marketing purposes. The governments of our markets have adopted, or are adopting, strict laws and regulations governing data privacy and data security, and these areas are rapidly evolving and are likely to remain uncertain for the near future. While we cannot yet determine the impact of such evolving laws and regulations may have on our business they will result in greater compliance risk and cost for us.\nThese laws and regulations often require us to do the following: implement new data privacy and security policies; permit individuals to access, correct and delete personal information stored by us: inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information; disclose to individuals how their personal information is processed and obtain their prior, express written consent to such processing; and localize individuals' PII within national borders, comply with cross border PII transfer requirements, among other things. Examples of significant, recent data privacy and security laws affecting our various markets include the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, (\"GDPR\"), and the California Consumer Privacy Act, (\"CCPA\"), China\u2019s national Data Privacy Law and the Personal Information Protection Law, and Cybersecurity Law. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our products, require us to restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our sales.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs in striving to comply with these various data privacy and security laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also require us to restrict our ability to provide services to our customers that they may find valuable or otherwise require us to change our business practices in a manner that is ultimately adverse to our business objectives. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with data security and privacy laws and regulations may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, significant fines and penalties, adverse publicity, or reputation damage, which could have an adverse effect our business and operating results.\nHuman Capital Risks Associated with our Business\nIf we are unable to attract and retain active Associates and Preferred Customers, our business may be harmed.\nOur consumer base includes Associates who personally consume and sell our products, Preferred Customers who join USANA and simply consume our products, and retail customers who do not join USANA but purchase products directly from us or one of our Associates and consume our products. We refer to Associates and Preferred Customers in this Annual Report together as active Customers. We rely largely on our Associates to market and sell our products and to generate active Customer growth. Our ability to maintain and increase sales in the future will depend in large part upon our success in increasing our number of active Customers. Our success will also depend on our ability to retain and motivate our existing Associates and attract new Associates to sell our products. Associates typically market and sell our products on a part-time basis and often engage in other business activities, some of which may compete with us. Our ability to continue to attract and retain active Customers can be affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including each of the other risks identified in this Annual Report. Our Associates may terminate their services at any time and, like most direct selling companies, we experience a high turnover among new active Customers from year to year. Customers may also stop buying from us at any time and it is challenging to determine why a customer actually stops buying. In 2021, some of our markets, including China, experienced active Customer declines. If our strategies, including our customer experience strategy, do not generate growth in our active Customer base, our operating results could be harmed. We cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of Associates because we primarily rely upon existing Associates to train new Associates and to motivate new and existing Associates. Our operating results may be adversely affected if we do not generate sufficient interest in our business and our products to successfully retain existing active Customers and attract new active Customers.\nWe also rely on the successful efforts of our Associates who become leaders with our Company. Our Compensation Plan is designed to permit Associates to sponsor new Associates and Preferred Customers, thereby creating sales organizations. As a result, Associates develop business and personal relationships with other Associates and Preferred Customers. The loss of a key Associate or group of Associates, large turnover or decreases in the size of the key Associate force, seasonal or other decreases in product purchases, sales volume reduction, the costs associated with training new Associates, and other related expenses may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur executive officers are primarily responsible for our day-to-day operations, and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers, to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team. We depend upon the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Guest; our President, Jim Brown; and our Chief Financial Officer, Douglas Hekking, as well as other key members of our executive team. We cannot guarantee continued service by our key executive officers. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers, nor do we have an employment agreement with any of our executive officers. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nGeneral Economic, Publicity, Competitive, and Intellectual Property Risks Associated with our Business\nDifficult economic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOver the past few years, economic conditions in many of the markets where we sell our products have resulted in challenges to our business and economies around the world have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict whether world or market-specific economies will improve or deteriorate in the future. If difficult economic conditions continue or worsen as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, we could experience declines in net sales, profitability and cash flow due to lower demand for our products or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers, potential customers or suppliers. Additionally, these conditions may result in a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources or otherwise negatively impact our operations or overall financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception.\nOur ability to attract and retain active Customers and to sustain and enhance sales through our Associates can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding our industry, our competition, or our business generally. Our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were tarnished by negative publicity. This negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality of direct selling, the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically, data privacy or security concerns, and regulatory investigations, regardless of whether those investigations involve us or our Associates or the business practices or products of our competitors or other direct selling companies.\nThere has been significant media and short-seller attention regarding the viability and legality of direct selling in the United States, China, and internationally over the past several years. This attention has led to intense public scrutiny of the industry, as well as volatility in our stock price and the stock price of companies similar to ours. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risks associated with intense competition from larger, wealthier, and more established competitors.\nWe face intense competition in the business of distributing and marketing nutritional supplements, vitamins and minerals, personal care products, and other nutritional products, as described in greater detail in \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d Numerous manufacturers, distributors, and retailers compete actively for consumers and, in the case of other direct selling companies, for Associates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment. In addition, nutrition and personal care products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution, including retail stores. Entry to market is not particularly capital intensive or otherwise subject to high barriers and as a result, new competitors can enter easily and compete with us for customers and distributors, including our Associates. Our product offerings in each product category are also relatively small, compared to the wide variety of products offered by many of our competitors.\nWe are also subject to significant competition from other direct selling organizations for the time, attention, and commitment of new and existing Associates. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in significant part, on our success in recruiting and retaining Associates. There can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining Associates will be successful. The pool of individuals who may be interested in direct selling is limited in each market, and it is reduced to the extent other direct selling companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses. Although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for Associates, there can be no assurance that other direct selling companies will not be able to recruit our existing Associates or deplete the pool of potential Associates in a given market. This risk is compounded by the relative ease with which our Associates can exit our business.\nOur business is subject to particular intellectual property risks.\nMost of our products are not protected by patents. The labeling regulations governing our nutritional supplements require that we indicate ingredients of such products precisely and accurately on product containers. Accordingly, patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common. Additionally, the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products, as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and the interactions among various substances. In this respect, we maintain an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better, purer, and more effective formulations of our products. We protect our investment in research, as well as the techniques we use to improve the purity and effectiveness of our products, by relying on trade secret laws. We have also entered into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees involved in research and development activities. Additionally, we endeavor to seek, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, trademark and trade dress protection for our products, which protection has been sought in many of our existing and potential future markets. Notwithstanding our efforts, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our trade secrets and trademarks will be successful. Nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of their intellectual proprietary rights. If an infringement claim is asserted, we may be required to obtain a license of such rights, pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis, or terminate our manufacturing and marketing of our infringing products. Litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe beneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives our founder and parties related to or affiliated with him effective control, and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues.\nGull Global, Ltd., an entity that is solely owned and controlled by our founder, Dr. Myron Wentz, owned approximately 41.20% of our outstanding common stock at January 1, 2022. Dr. Wentz is no longer active in the management of USANA and is an emeritus member of our Board of Directors. By virtue of this stock ownership, Dr. Wentz is able to exert significant influence and control over the election of the members of our Board of Directors and our business affairs. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to shareholders. There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to these relationships or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to our other shareholders.\nSales by our shareholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA large number of outstanding shares of our common stock are held by several of our principal shareholders, including Gull Global, Ltd. If any of these principal shareholders were to decide to sell large amounts of stock over a short period of time such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThere can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will be sustained. We have a relatively small public float compared to the number of our shares outstanding. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which investors\u2019 interest in our common stock will provide an active and liquid trading market. We are also vulnerable to investors taking a \u201cshort position\u201d in our common stock, which has the effect of depressing the price of our common stock and adding volatility to our trading market. The price of our common stock also may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results, material announcements by us or our competitors, governmental regulatory action, conditions in the nutritional supplement industry, negative publicity, or other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices of many dietary and nutritional supplement companies and which have not had a strong correlation in certain cases to the operating performance of these companies. Our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If that were to occur, the price of our common stock, and accordingly, the value of a shareholder\u2019s investment in our company, would likely decline, perhaps substantially.", "PERMNO": 84010, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "USNA"}
