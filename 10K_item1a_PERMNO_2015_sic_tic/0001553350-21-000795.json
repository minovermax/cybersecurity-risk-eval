You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you might lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our operations and business results.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or the perception of its effects, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTo date, COVID-19 has not had a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations, but due to the uncertainties surrounding this pandemic, it may adversely impact us in the future. We may experience disruptions in our supply chain and critical suppliers may delay or be unable to deliver products we have ordered. Additionally, our customers could reduce planned orders, request cancelations of existing orders, and/or delay payment to us due to financial hardship they may experience as a result of this healthcare and resulting economic crisis. Therefore, it is impossible at this time to predict the ultimate short-term or long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.\nOur employees are being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our office and management personnel were working remotely during much of fiscal 2021, but our employees engaged in manufacturing and assembly continued and are continuing to work at our corporate headquarters. The health of our workforce is of primary concern and we may need to enact further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to the coronavirus. Further, our management team is focused on mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across the entire Company, thereby diverting their attention from other priorities that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. To date, several of our employees have had COVID-19, but all have made full recoveries and returned to work. If more of our employees test positive for COVID-19, or these conditions worsen, or last for an extended period of time, our ability to manage our business may be impaired, and operational risks, cybersecurity risks, and other risks facing us even prior to the pandemic may be elevated.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a few customers. If we were to lose a key customer, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2021, our top three customers accounted for 91% of our sales, with our current largest customer accounting for 58% of our sales. This customer has made purchase commitments to us through a supply agreement to purchase surgical handpieces through calendar 2025. We provide this customer with a device used primarily in elective surgeries and although this customer has not requested a reduction or delay to their planned shipments, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the United States and other markets where our products are sold, coupled with the recommended deferrals of elective procedures by governments and other authorities, we would expect to see a decline in demand from our principal customer. The loss of this customer or any of our significant customers would severely impact us, including having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue, and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our business is derived from our core business area that, if not serviced properly, may result in a material adverse impact upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2021, we derived 98% of our revenue from sales of our medical device products and related services. We believe that a primary factor in the market acceptance of our products and services is the value they create for our customers. Our future financial performance will depend in large part on our ability to continue to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers through the timely development, and successful introduction and implementation of new and enhanced products and services, while at the same time continuing to provide the value our customers have come to expect from us. We have historically expended a significant percentage of our revenue on product development and believe that significant continued product development efforts will be required to sustain our growth. Continued investment in our sales and marketing efforts will also be required to support future growth.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product development efforts, that the market will continue to accept our existing products, or that new products or product enhancements will be developed and implemented in a timely manner, meet the requirements of our customers, or achieve market acceptance. If the market does not continue to accept our existing products, or our new products or product enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur customers may cancel or reduce their orders, change production quantities, or delay production, any of which would reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations.\nSince most of our customers purchase our products from us on a purchase order basis, they may cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us. As a result, we are not always able to forecast with certainty the sales that we will make in a given period and sometimes we may increase our inventory, working capital, and overhead in expectation of orders that may never be placed, or, if placed, may be delayed, reduced, or canceled.\nThe following factors, among others, affect our ability to forecast accurately our sales and production capacity:\n\u00b7 Changes in the specific products or quantities our customers order; and\n\u00b7 Long lead times and advance financial commitments for components required to complete actual/anticipated customer orders.\nIn addition to reducing our sales, delayed, reduced, or canceled purchase orders also may result in our inability to recover costs that we incur in anticipation of those orders, such as costs associated with purchased raw materials and write-offs of obsolete inventory.\nIn recent years, we have launched many new medical device products and our estimates of warranty claims are based largely on our previous history from similar legacy products. If actual warranty claims exceed our estimates, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, we have completed significant medical device development projects in the CMF and thoracic surgical segments for which we have made estimates of product warranty claims based upon similar, legacy products. If the actual repair volumes or repair costs exceed the estimates that we have been using, we may incur additional costs which could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significant competition from a number of different sources, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe markets for products in the industries served by our customers are intensely competitive, and we face significant competition from a number of different sources. Several of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, than us.\nWe compete in all of our markets with other major surgical device and related companies. As a provider of outsourced products and services, we also compete with our customers\u2019 own internal development groups. Competitive pressures and other factors, such as new product or new technology introductions by us, our customers\u2019 internal development and manufacturing departments, or our competitors, may result in price or market share erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, there can be no assurance that our products and services will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other products.\nThe industry in which we operate is subject to significant technological change and any failure or delay in addressing such change could adversely affect our competitive position or could make our current products obsolete.\nThe medical device market is generally characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards.\nNew product development requires significant research and development expenditures that we have historically funded through operations; however, we may be unable to do so in the future. Any significant decrease in revenues or research funding could impair our ability to respond to technological advances in the marketplace and to remain competitive. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Although we continue to target new markets for access, develop new products, and update existing products, there can be no assurance that we will do so successfully or that, even if we are successful, such efforts will be completed concurrently with or prior to the introduction of competing products. Any such failure or delay could adversely affect our competitive position or could make our current products obsolete.\nWe rely heavily on our proprietary technology, which, if not properly protected or if deemed invalid, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the maintenance and protection of our proprietary technology and rely on patent filings, exclusive development and supply agreements, confidentiality procedures and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect it. There can be no assurance that the legal protections and precautions taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies equivalent or superior to ours. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States and are often not enforced as vigorously as those in the United States.\nWe do not believe that our operations or products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. However, there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement or trade secret claims against us with respect to our current or future products. As an example, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. Assertions or claims by others, whether or not valid, could cause us to incur significant legal costs defending our intellectual property rights and potentially require us to enter into a license agreement or royalty arrangement with the party asserting the claim or to cease our use of the infringing technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our technology infrastructure is compromised, damaged or interrupted by a cybersecurity incident, data security breach or other security problems, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations, and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems. We use software and other technology systems, among other things, to generate sales orders, job orders, and purchase orders and to monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis. Cybersecurity incidents can include computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, worms, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, bugs, security vulnerabilities or security weaknesses, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges, intentional acts of vandalism by third parties and sabotage.\nIn addition, our technology infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss and telecommunications failures. Any such disruption to our systems, or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as anticipated, or the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, loss of customers, potential liability, including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies, and competitive disadvantage, any or all of which would potentially adversely affect our customer service, decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits. Moreover, a cybersecurity breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems associated with the breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to protect information against cyber-attacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information, which could result in a disruption of our operations.\nWhile we have invested, and continue to invest, in technology security initiatives and other measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, as well as disaster recovery plans, these initiatives and measures may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo service our debt obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash. However, our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, in turn, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs. In these circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt obligations, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Without this financing, we could be forced to sell assets or secure additional financing to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances. However, we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all and, in addition, the agreements governing our debt obligations limit our ability to sell assets. In addition, we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations.\nWe periodically invest surplus cash in marketable securities and other investments in order to realize a positive return, although there can be no assurance that a positive return will be realized, and we could lose some or all of our investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe invest a significant portion of our excess capital in marketable securities, including equity securities of publicly traded companies. At June 30, 2021, the fair value of these marketable securities was approximately $3.0 million. Approximately $1.7 million of our investments at June 30, 2021 include equity securities of companies that are thinly traded. As such, these investments are classified as long-term in nature, as we may not be able to liquidate the investments in a timely manner even if we wish to sell them. While we intend to hold our investments, we may have unexpected cash requirements that could necessitate the sale of some or all of these marketable securities for a loss.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our business acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have acquired, and may acquire in the future, businesses, products, and technologies that complement or expand our current operations. Acquisitions could require significant capital investments and require us to integrate with companies that have different cultures, management teams, and business infrastructure. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the acquisition could depend on several factors, including:\n\u00b7 Difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, products, and workforce of an acquired business;\n\u00b7 The retention of key employees;\n\u00b7 Management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas;\n\u00b7 The integration or coordination of different research and development and product manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7 Successfully converting information and accounting systems; and\n\u00b7 Diversion of resources and management attention from our other operations.\nIf market conditions or other factors require us to change our strategic direction, we may fail to realize the expected value from one or more of our acquisitions. Our failure to successfully integrate any future acquisitions or realize the expected value from past or future acquisitions could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have experienced losses in the past, and we cannot be certain that we will sustain our current profitability; we may need additional capital in the future to fund our businesses, which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms.\nWe have experienced operating losses in the past. Our ability to achieve or sustain profitability is based on a number of factors, many of which are out of our control, including the material costs for our products and the demand for our products.\nWe currently anticipate that our available capital resources, including our existing cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable balances, will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements as our business is currently conducted for at least the next 12 months. We may also attempt to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings, if such financings become available on acceptable terms. We cannot be certain that any additional financing we may need will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of opportunities, develop new products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures, and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur operations are dependent upon our key personnel. If such personnel were to leave unexpectedly, we may not be able to execute our business plan.\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel. Because we have a relatively small number of employees when compared to other companies in the same industry, our dependence on maintaining our relationship with key employees is particularly significant. We are also dependent on our ability to attract and retain high quality personnel, particularly in the areas of product development, operations management, marketing and finance.\nA high level of employee mobility and the aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel characterize the medical device industry. There can be no assurance that our current employees will continue to work for us. Loss of services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, we may need to provide enhanced forms of incentive compensation to attract and retain such key personnel, which could potentially dilute the holdings of other shareholders.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nTwo of our directors hold voting power with respect to a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock that enables them to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, which influence may conflict with our interests and the interests of other shareholders.\nAs of September 3, 2021, two of our directors, Nicholas J. Swenson and Raymond E. Cabillot, directly or indirectly, controlled voting power over approximately 36% (26% and 9%, respectively) of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result of such voting control, these directors will have significant influence over all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions, and may have interests that conflict with our interests and the interests of other shareholders.\nOur quarterly results can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which may negatively impact the price of our shares and/or cause significant variances in the prices at which our shares trade.\nOur sales have fluctuated in the past, and may fluctuate in the future from quarter to quarter and period to period, as a result of a number of factors, including, without limitation: the size and timing of orders from customers; the length of new product development cycles; market acceptance of new technologies; changes in pricing policies or price reductions by us or our competitors; the timing of new product announcements and product introductions by us or our competitors; the financial stability of major customers; our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs; acceleration, deferral, or cancellation of customer orders and deliveries; changes in our strategy; revenue recognition policies in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d); personnel changes; and general market and economic factors.\nBecause a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed, a variation in the timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result, we believe that interim period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. Further, our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for any particular period.\nIn addition, it is possible that our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such an event, the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nRegulatory & Compliance Risks\nOur operations are subject to a number of complex government regulations, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe manufacture and distribution of medical devices are subject to state and federal requirements set forth by various government agencies including the FDA and EPA. The statutes, regulations, administrative orders, and advisories that affect our businesses are complex and subject to diverse, often conflicting, interpretations. While we make every effort to maintain full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to eliminate the ongoing risk that one or more of our activities may at some point be determined to be non-compliant. The penalties for non-compliance could range from an administrative warning to termination of a portion of our business. Furthermore, even if we are subsequently determined to have fully complied with applicable laws or regulations, the costs to achieve such a determination and the intervening loss of business could adversely affect or result in the cessation of a portion of our business. A change in such laws or regulations at any time may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe FDA designates all medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III) based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device (with Class I requiring the lowest level of control and Class III requiring the greatest level of control). The surgical instrumentation we manufacture is generally classified into Class I. The FDA has broad enforcement powers to recall and prohibit the sale of products that do not comply with federal regulations and to order the cessation of non-compliant processes. No claim has been made to date by the FDA regarding any of our products or processes. Nevertheless, as is common in the industry, certain of our products and processes are from time to time subject to routine governmental reviews and investigations. We are also subject to EPA regulations concerning the disposal of industrial waste.\nWhile management believes that our products and processes fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the outcome of any such future review or investigation.\nWe face risks and uncertainties associated with potential litigation by or against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe continually face the possibility of litigation as either a plaintiff or a defendant (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). It is not reasonably possible to estimate the awards or damages, or the range of awards or damages, if any, that we might incur in connection with such litigation.\nMany of our products are complex and technologically advanced. Such products may, from time to time, be the subject of claims concerning product performance and construction, including warranty and patent infringement claims. While we are committed to investigating such concerns and correcting them, there is no assurance that solutions will be found on a timely basis, if at all, to satisfy customer demands or to avoid potential claims or litigation. Also, due to the location of our facilities, as well as the nature of our business activities, there is a risk that we could be subject to litigation related to environmental remediation claims. We maintain insurance to protect against claims associated with the manufacture and use of our products as well as environmental pollution, but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will adequately cover any claim asserted against us.\nThe uncertainty associated with potential litigation may have an adverse impact on our business. In particular, litigation could impair our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers. Defending or prosecuting litigation could result in significant legal costs and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from business operations, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that litigation would not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims, or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our business and could adversely affect our ability to undertake certain corporate actions.\nThe agreements governing our debt obligations include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional debt;\n\u00b7 declare or pay dividends to shareholders;\n\u00b7 create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u00b7 be acquired by a third party;\n\u00b7 pursue strategic acquisitions;\n\u00b7 engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7 sell or transfer assets.\nThe agreements governing our debt obligations also require us to comply with a number of financial ratios, borrowing base requirements and additional covenants.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition, or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our debt obligations. If we were unable to repay our debt or are otherwise in default under any provision governing our secured debt obligations, our lender could proceed against us and against the collateral securing that debt.\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance, compliance with which could be costly and time consuming.\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting standards that govern the measurement of our performance. Based on our reading and interpretations of relevant pronouncements, guidance, or concepts issued by, among other authorities, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, management believes our performance, including current sales contract terms and business arrangements, has been properly reported. However, there continue to be issued pronouncements, interpretations, and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the industries in which we operate. Future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices may result in future changes in our accounting policies and practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue, and results of operations.\nOur evaluation of internal controls and remediation of potential problems is costly and time consuming and could expose weaknesses in financial reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, requires management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This process is expensive and time consuming and requires significant attention of management. Management can give no assurance that material weaknesses in internal controls will not be discovered. If a material weakness is discovered, corrective action may be time consuming and costly, and could further divert the attention of management. The disclosure of a material weakness, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price, especially if a restatement of financial statements for past periods is required.\nGeneral Risks\nThe global economic environment may impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in the global economic environment have caused, and may cause in the future, a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. These macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition should they cause, for example, current or potential customers to become unable to fund purchases of our products, in turn resulting in delays, decreases or cancellations of purchases of our products and services, or causing the customer to not pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. In addition, financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to obtain financing for our operations, investing activities (including the financing of any future acquisitions), or financing activities. Additional economic risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 10550, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "PDEX"}
