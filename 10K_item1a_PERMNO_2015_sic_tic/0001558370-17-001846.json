{"cik": "1041024", "company": "ROCKWELL MEDICAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DRUG BUSINESS\nAlthough Triferic has been approved by the FDA, we may not be able to commercialize it successfully.\nThe commercial success of Triferic will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nIV iron currently dominates treatment for iron deficiency and Triferic will have to compete against it and possibly other existing and future products;\n\u00b7\nIt may be difficult to gain market acceptance from dialysis chains, anemia managers and nephrologists or such acceptance may be slower than expected. Market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, such as demonstration of Triferic\u2019s safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, advantages over existing products, and the reimbursement policies of government and third party payers, including Medicare;\n\u00b7\nWe are seeking transitional add-on reimbursement status from CMS to separately pay for Triferic outside of the standard dialysis bundled payment. Dialysis providers have been slow to adopt Triferic in the absence of such status. In the absence of a favorable determination from CMS, dialysis service providers are likely to adopt Triferic at a much slower rate than if Triferic is granted such status due to the cost of conversion and lack of an immediate financial incentive to adopt Triferic;\n\u00b7\nMaintaining compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements applicable to Triferic or which apply generally to the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping applicable to the product;\n\u00b7\nThe effectiveness of our marketing, sales and distribution strategies and operations for development and commercialization, and our ability to execute our marketing strategy without significant additional expenditures;\n\u00b7\nCompetitors may engage in anti-competitive practices and other tactics to retain their market share;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to avoid third party patent interference or patent infringement claims;\n\u00b7\nA continued acceptable safety profile of Triferic; and\n\u00b7\nDiscovery of previously unknown problems with Triferic or with any third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.\nAn adverse development with respect to any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market Triferic. These factors are largely beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will receive transitional add-on reimbursement status for Triferic from CMS or that we will be able to generate significant revenues through the sale of Triferic. If we are not successful in commercializing Triferic, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our entire investment in Triferic may be worthless, our licensing rights could be affected and the price of our common stock could substantially decline. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Triferic and achieve sufficient sales volumes over the next one to two years, we may have to write off a portion of our inventory investment in Triferic. Even if we were successful in commercializing Triferic, due to the highly concentrated nature of the market, our continued success may depend on adoption of Triferic by a few customers.\nTriferic is currently limited to use in adult patients receiving hemodialysis treatments and has not been approved for other indications. Regulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated, which may limit our ability to market our drug products.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products or encourage our customers to use the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA as safe and effective. Any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any other indications for Triferic, our ability to effectively market and sell Triferic may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, if our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, the FDA that may include penalties, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, denial of future regulatory approvals, withdrawal or suspension of existing regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, debarment, exclusion and criminal prosecution, any of which could materially harm our business.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act to extend patent protection for Triferic, our business may be harmed.\nThe United States Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the \u201cHatch-Waxman Act,\u201d provides that patent holders may apply for an extension of patent term for drugs for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development and regulatory approval. We have applied for an extension, and received a temporary one year extension but there can be no assurance that we will receive the full extension of the patent term provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act for either of the licensed Triferic patents that expired at the end of 2016. If we fail to receive the full extension, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of Triferic could be impaired and we would have to rely on the protection afforded us by the United States patent we hold on the synthesis and formulation of our pharmaceutical grade formulation of Triferic which expires in 2029 or on other patents related to Triferic that may be issued to us in the future.\nOur Calcitriol contract manufacturer has made changes to the manufacturing process for Calcitriol that require FDA approval prior to commercial sale of Calcitriol. The FDA review process has delayed our launch of Calcitriol and, even if approved, we may not be able to commercialize Calcitriol successfully.\nWhile we have received FDA approval to manufacture a generic version of Calcitriol, our CMO made changes to the process that requires prior FDA approval before the commercial products can be sold that were produced under the process change. Even if approved, we must also meet certain ongoing regulatory requirements for product testing and stability of our commercially marketed products. If our testing does not meet approvable standards, if our CMO cannot\nmake the product in sufficient quantities and on a consistent basis or if we experience operational issues with our CMO, we may not be able to market Calcitriol successfully or the launch may be further delayed.\nThe market for generic drugs such as Calcitriol is generally very competitive, which may make it difficult for us to capture significant market share. If we have success in capturing market share with Calcitriol, it may attract other entrants to market their own Calcitriol product, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and results of operations. Branded competitors may aggressively lower their prices to maintain market share. Dialysis service providers may seek alternative forms of treatment for this indication.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals or in arranging an out-licensing or other venture to realize commercialization of our drug products outside of the United States. Even if we are successful in out-licensing our drug products, the licensees or partners may not be effective at marketing our products in certain markets or at all.\nThe approval procedures for marketing our new drug products, such as Triferic, outside the United States vary from country to country, can be difficult to obtain and carry the same risks as FDA approval. In particular, regulatory approval in foreign countries may require additional testing and may otherwise be expensive and time consuming to undertake. Even after foreign approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before products may be marketed. Many countries require additional government approval for price reimbursement under national health insurance systems.\nEven if we obtain the necessary foreign approval in a particular market, we do not have substantial expertise selling and marketing on an international level and therefore may not be successful in realizing commercial value from our products should we attempt to develop international markets ourselves. Our strategy for addressing the need for expertise in obtaining foreign approvals and marketing in foreign markets is to out-license rights to our drugs in markets outside the United States. However, we may not be successful in finding partners in addition to Wanbang, our Chinese market partner, or ARAM Medical, our distributor in the Middle East, who will be willing to invest in our drugs outside the United States or our partners may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. If we are not successful in out-licensing our drugs outside of the United States or entering into some other business development arrangement to obtain the necessary approvals to commercialize them, or if our partners are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, we may be forced to seek regulatory approval and market these products ourselves. If we elect to seek approval ourselves, it may take longer than expected to obtain regulatory approval and to market and manufacture our drugs, and we may decide to delay or abandon development efforts in certain markets.\nAny such delay or abandonment, or any failure to receive one or more foreign approvals, may have an adverse effect on the benefits otherwise expected from marketing in foreign countries.\nIf we are successful in obtaining other business partners to commercialize our products in foreign markets, we will be dependent upon their effectiveness in selling and marketing our products in those foreign markets. These partners may face stiff competition, government price regulations, generic versions of our drug products, violations of our intellectual property rights and other negative events or may otherwise be ineffective in commercializing our products, any of which could reduce the market potential for our products and our success in those markets.\nWe will rely on third party suppliers for raw materials, packaging components and manufacturing of our drug products. We may not be able to obtain the raw materials, proper components or manufacturing capacity we need, or the cost of the materials, components or manufacturing capacity may be higher than expected, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our expected results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain needed raw materials, packaging components and manufacturing capacity for a variety of reasons, including among others:\n\u00b7\nWe may be required to purchase certain raw materials and packaging components from unaffiliated third-party suppliers who may not be able to supply us consistently or at all;\n\u00b7\nRegulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others, including delays in receiving necessary approvals;\n\u00b7\nAdverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting a supplier or contract manufacturer;\n\u00b7\nUnexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials or packaging components;\n\u00b7\nFailure to comply with cGMP standards which results in quality or product failures, adulteration, contamination and/or recall;\n\u00b7\nChanges made to manufacturing processes by our contract manufacturers may result in regulatory delays until such changes are approved regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nLimitations in capacity of contract manufacturers; and\n\u00b7\nChanges in product demand.\nIf we are unable to obtain the raw materials, components and manufacturing capacity we require, or if we are charged more than expected for these items, we may not be able to produce the desired quantities of our drug products or our expected gross profit margins may be materially adversely affected.\nBefore it can be marketed, an investigational drug requires FDA approval, which is a long, expensive process with no guarantee of success.\nPerforming clinical trials and obtaining FDA approval for any drug can take a long time. Clinical trials typically take many months or years to complete. Once trials are completed and the NDA, is submitted to the FDA, the FDA may find deficiencies in our NDA, may raise safety or efficacy concerns or may otherwise require additional clinical testing or impose other requirements before granting approval, which could significantly delay approval or result in us not receiving approval at all.\nClinical trials and the NDA approval process for any new drug candidate are expensive. If we were to develop new drug candidates and we experience delays, or additional testing or other unplanned requirements are imposed on us, we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available when needed or may be available only on terms that are not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, or which result in substantial dilution of shareholders\u2019 voting power and ownership. New indications of Triferic when submitted to the FDA for approval will require us to pay review fees. If approval is not granted for any new products submitted, our entire investment in the related products may be worthless, any licensing rights could be forfeited and the price of our common stock could substantially decline.\nOur drug business will depend on government funding of health care, and changes could impact our ability to be paid in full for our products, increase prices or cause consolidation in the dialysis provider market.\nMany dialysis providers receive the majority of their funding from the government and are supplemented by payments from private health care insurers. These providers depend on Medicare and Medicaid funding to be viable businesses. Congress continuously enacts a variety of changes to health insurance and reimbursement, some of which could have a negative impact on Medicare and Medicaid funding, which fund the majority of dialysis costs in the United States, and on reimbursement protocols. If Medicare and Medicaid funding were to be materially decreased, these providers would be severely impacted, increasing our risk of not being paid in full. An increase in our exposure to uncollectible accounts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince 2011, CMS has continued to modify reimbursement policies for dialysis under the ESRD prospective payment system generally resulting in lower payment to dialysis providers. We anticipate that dialysis providers will continue to seek ways to reduce their costs per treatment due to this change in reimbursement practice which could reduce our sales and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCMS continues to make changes to the ESRD Quality Incentive Program, or QIP, which pays dialysis providers an incentive to improve the quality of care. Final ESRD regulations published in October 2015 include changes to QIP for CYs 2017-2019. Each facility\u2019s total performance score is posted on the CMS website. Low performance scores at\nour customers could result in a reduction in patient volume, a reduction in payment rates and a decrease in sales for those customers.\nPPACA also proposes changes to Medicaid, including decreasing the amount of federal dollars available to the states and eliminating the Medicaid expansion program, resulting in fewer people qualifying for Medicaid benefits. If implemented, these changes could impact reimbursement by the Medicaid program for our drug products and dialysis.\nAs a result of these changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, the dialysis provider industry may continue to consolidate. This may result in increased purchasing leverage for providers across all dialysis product categories and increased pricing pressure on all suppliers to the industry.\nOur efforts to obtain transitional add on reimbursement status for Triferic may not be successful.\nWe have worked to obtain broad based support for transitional add-on reimbursement status from CMS for Triferic and we believe that there is a strong likelihood that Triferic will receive transitional add-on reimbursement status. However, we cannot predict when or even if CMS will grant such status. If CMS does not grant transitional add-on reimbursement status for Triferic we believe the pace of adoption for Triferic will be much slower than if such status is granted due to cost considerations by dialysis service providers. While we believe that Triferic\u2019s attributes make it a better choice for patients and that it will become the standard of care in iron maintenance therapy for hemodialysis patients, we cannot predict future usage of Triferic. We have invested over $10,000,000 in Triferic inventory, including approximately $9 million in Triferic API, which generally has a three year shelf life, and $1.3 million in finished goods inventory with shelf lives ranging from 1-3 years. If we are unable to utilize some or all of the Triferic inventory before its shelf life expires, some or all of our investment in Triferic inventory may not be saleable, reducing the inventory we have available for sale and requiring us to reserve for the reduction in value. We may also need to reserve for inventory that we estimate will not be sold before such inventory expires. Any such inventory reserve could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nHealth care reform could adversely affect our business.\nThe federal and state governments in the United States, as well as many foreign governments, from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through health care reform. The federal Medicare and Medicaid programs are facing financial challenges and are looking at ways to reduce the costs of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Similarly, many states have large deficits which may prove unsustainable, resulting in defaults on state debt obligations which may ultimately result in the reduction or curtailment of health care benefits or state Medicaid reimbursement.\nThe United States government faces structural deficits that may require changes to government funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid which may negatively impact customers of our products. Our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows and ability to commercialize our drug products could be materially impacted by the PPACA, future health care reform or reduced Medicare and Medicaid spending by the federal government. In addition, legislative and administrative efforts to repeal or modify the PPACA are underway. We cannot predict how reform or replacement of PPACA or other health care reform will affect our business and any such changes could substantially modify the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices or the number of patients eligible for reimbursement.\nDevice and pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to report annually to the Department of Health and Human Services regarding certain financial relationships they have with physicians and teaching hospitals. This reporting requirement will increase governmental scrutiny on our contractual relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals and will increase the risk that inadvertent violations result in liability under the federal fraud and abuse laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONCENTRATE BUSINESS\nWe are in arbitration to resolve disputes with Baxter regarding the Distribution Agreement, which could result in termination of the Distribution Agreement or have other material adverse consequences for us.\nUnder the Distribution Agreement, Baxter is our exclusive agent for commercializing our hemodialysis concentrate and ancillary products in the United States and various foreign countries. The Agreement does not involve\nRockwell\u2019s drug products. In September 2016, Baxter initiated an arbitration proceeding against us, alleging that we have materially breached the Distribution Agreement in various respects. Baxter seeks declaratory relief giving Baxter the right to terminate the Distribution Agreement and recover a portion of the upfront fee, injunctive relief to prevent us from establishing a West Coast facility, and unspecified damages. We filed a response denying all of Baxter\u2019s claims of breach and wrongdoing, and have counterclaimed that Baxter is itself in material breach of the Distribution Agreement for failing to pay certain accounts receivable and for repudiating its obligation to pay the West Coast facility fee. We are seeking damages, declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as interest, costs and attorney fees. In addition, in October 2016, we gave notice to Baxter that it breached the minimum purchase requirement for the contract year ending October 2, 2016 and that we intended to cause its distribution rights to become non-exclusive unless it cured the shortfall within the 30-day period specified in the Distribution Agreement. Baxter disputed the existence of a breach and failed to cure the shortfall. Rockwell subsequently provided Baxter with notice of loss of exclusivity due to its failure to cure as provided in the Distribution Agreement. The determination of whether a breach occurred resulting in a loss of exclusivity and the outcome of the other pending disputes with Baxter will be determined through the arbitration process.\nThere can be no assurance that our disputes with Baxter will be resolved in the arbitration in our favor. If resolution of the dispute permits Baxter to not pay us the amounts owed to us, requires us to pay amounts to Baxter in excess of any reserve we may establish in connection with this matter or requires us to refund a portion of the upfront payment made by Baxter to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Moreover, the arbitration process will be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention away from operation of our business.\nIn addition, given the possibility that either the Distribution Agreement will be terminated by us or Baxter upon completion of the arbitration or that Baxter\u2019s distribution rights will become non-exclusive, we believe that Baxter is unlikely to commit material financial and other resources to the marketing and distribution of our products while the arbitration process continues. As a result, unit sales of our concentrate products may fall and we may lose customers to our competitors during the arbitration process, resulting in lower revenues and gross margin for us. If the Distribution Agreement were to terminate or if Baxter\u2019s distribution rights were to become non-exclusive, we may have to compete directly for customers with competitors. Such competition could have the effect of further reducing our sales and adversely affecting our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may be required to repay a portion of the fees received from Baxter, which could materially and adversely affect our financial position and cash reserves.\nPursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement, we may be required to repay a portion of the upfront fee and a portion of the facility fee to Baxter upon the occurrence of a \"Refund Trigger Event.\" A \"Refund Trigger Event\" includes, among other events, termination due to an uncured material breach by us. Occurrence of a Refund Trigger Event would obligate us to refund 50% of the $20 million upfront fee (and any portion of the facility fee paid by Baxter) if the event occurs prior to December 31, 2016, 33% of the $20 million upfront fee if the event occurs in 2017 or 2018, and 25% of the $20 million upfront fee if the event occurs in 2019, 2020 or 2021.\nIn September 2016, Baxter initiated an arbitration proceeding against us alleging material breaches of the Distribution Agreement and seeking various forms of relief, including the right to terminate the Distribution Agreement and receive a refund of a portion of the upfront fee. We have filed a response denying all of Baxter\u2019s claims and a counterclaim alleging that Baxter is in material breach of the Distribution Agreement.\nIn addition, if Baxter terminates the Distribution Agreement because it has been enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction from selling in the United States any product covered by the Distribution Agreement due to a claim of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation relating to such product prior to the end of 2018, Baxter would be entitled to a refund of up to $10 million, or $6.6 million if the termination occurs in 2019.\nIf we are required to make any such refund payment, we may need to reallocate funds from other parts of our business, which could force us to change or delay plans for use of that capital. In any such event, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash reserves could be materially and adversely affected.\nA few customers account for a substantial portion of the end user sales of our concentrate products. The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow from our concentrate business.\nA substantial portion of our concentrate and ancillary products are primarily sold to or through Baxter. Its sales of our products are highly concentrated in a few customers and Baxter\u2019s loss of any of those customers could adversely affect our results of operations for one year or less depending on when Baxter would lose exclusivity for not meeting the minimum order threshold; one customer accounted for nearly half of our sales in each of the last three years and for a substantial number of the clinics we serve.\nThe concentrate market is very competitive and has a large competitor with substantial resources.\nThe primary competitor in the market for our concentrate products is a large diversified company which has substantial financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, research and management resources. We and our distributor, Baxter, may not be able to successfully compete with them or other companies. The primary competitor has historically used product bundling and low pricing as marketing techniques to capture market share of the concentrate products we sell. We and Baxter may be at a disadvantage in competing against their marketing strategies to sell our products. Furthermore, the primary competitor is vertically integrated and is the largest provider of dialysis services in the United States, treating approximately 36% of all U.S. patients through its clinics. This competitor has routinely acquired smaller clinic chain operations which we supply through Baxter. This competitor may acquire more of the customers we service in the future.\nWe may be affected materially and adversely by increases in raw material costs.\nA significant portion of our costs relates to chemicals and other raw materials, which are subject to price volatility based on demand and are highly influenced by the overall level of economic activity in the United States and abroad. These costs have tended to rise from year to year and are likely to continue to rise in the future. Under our Distribution Agreement with Baxter, such cost inflation may result in increases in the prices we charge Baxter. If these increases exceed specified levels in the Distribution Agreement, Baxter is permitted to terminate the Distribution Agreement and obtain a refund of a portion of the fees we received from Baxter. Any such termination or refund could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur concentrate business is highly regulated, which increases our costs and the risk and consequence of noncompliance.\nAlthough our hemodialysis concentrates have been cleared by the FDA, it could rescind these clearances and any new products or modifications to our current products that we develop could fail to receive FDA clearance. If the FDA rescinds or denies any current or future clearances or approvals for our products, we would be prohibited from selling those products in the United States until we obtain such clearances or approvals. Our business would be adversely affected by any such prohibition, any delay in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, and any limits placed by the FDA on our intended use. Our products are also subject to federal regulations regarding good manufacturing practices and quality. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in FDA action or product liability litigation adverse to us. Any of these events could constitute a breach by us of the Distribution Agreement, providing Baxter with various remedies that would be material and adverse to us, including without limitation, termination of the Distribution Agreement. Moreover, changes in applicable regulatory requirements could significantly increase the costs of our operations and, if such higher costs result in price increases that exceed the thresholds specified in the Distribution Agreement, could give Baxter the right to terminate the Distribution Agreement and obtain a partial refund of certain fees paid to us pursuant to that agreement.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE\nWe may not be successful in expanding our product portfolio or in our business development efforts related to in-licensing, acquisitions or other business collaborations. Even if we are able to enter into business development arrangements, they could have a negative impact on our business and our profitability.\nAs part of our business strategy to expand our product portfolio, we are seeking to acquire or in-license other drug products that we believe are a complementary fit with our current product portfolio as well as other products that\nwe believe have substantial development potential. Our experience with respect to these business development activities is limited. The negotiation of such arrangements can be a lengthy and complex process and there can be no assurance that any such negotiations will be completed on a timely basis or on terms that are cost-effective and acceptable to us or, if they are completed, that we will be able to effectively integrate, develop and launch such products effectively.\nIn addition, the market potential for new products is highly uncertain and evaluation of such potential requires significant judgment and assumptions. There is a significant risk that any new product may not be able to be brought to market as profitably as expected or at all. If the results of any new product initiative were materially worse than expected, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\nOur drug and concentrate businesses are highly regulated, resulting in additional expense and risk of noncompliance that can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are highly regulated. The testing, manufacture and sale of the products we manufacture directly or through third party contractors are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state and foreign authorities. Before drugs or medical devices, such as our concentrate products, can be commercially marketed in the United States, the FDA must give either premarket approval or 510(k) clearance. Even after a product is approved, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. In addition, our products are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and in other jurisdictions where they are marketed. In addition, manufacturers and their facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current cGMP and applicable state laws. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and state laws. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance. We are also required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, state agencies and foreign regulatory authorities, when applicable, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products.\nIf a regulatory agency determines that we do not comply with any applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, state and federal government authorities that may include penalties, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, denial of future regulatory approvals, withdrawal or suspension of existing regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. If regulatory sanctions are applied, the value of our Company and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of which could harm our ability to operate.\nOur success depends heavily on the efforts of Robert L. Chioini, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ajay Gupta, our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Raymond D. Pratt, our Chief Medical Officer, and Thomas E. Klema, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. Mr. Chioini is primarily responsible for the strategic direction of the Company and for managing our sales and marketing efforts. Dr. Gupta is primarily responsible for discovery and development of new technologies. Dr. Pratt is primarily responsible for the clinical development, testing and regulatory approval of our products. No member of our executive management team has an employment agreement with the Company. If we lose the services of Mr. Chioini, Dr. Gupta, Dr. Pratt or Mr. Klema, our business, product development efforts, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages and compelled to defend against litigation if we infringe the rights of a third party.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe could incur substantial costs in seeking enforcement of our patent rights against infringement, and we cannot guarantee that such patents will successfully preclude others from using technology that we rely upon. We have no knowledge of any infringement or patent litigation, threatened or filed at this time. It is possible that we may infringe on intellectual property rights of others without being aware of the infringement. If a third party believes that one of our products infringes on the third party\u2019s patent, it may sue us even if we have received our own patent protection for the technology. If we infringe the rights of a third party, we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages and compelled to defend against litigation. If Baxter is prevented from selling from any of our concentrate or ancillary products due to a patent infringement or if its ability to sell any of our concentrate or ancillary products due to a patent infringement is materially and adversely affected, Baxter may be entitled to terminate our Distribution Agreement and obtain a refund of a portion of the upfront fee and facility fee.\nOur products may have undesirable side effects and our product liability insurance may not be sufficient to protect us from material liability or harm to our business.\nIf concerns are raised regarding the safety of a new drug as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing, the FDA may decline to approve the drug at the end of the NDA review period or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the drug. Following FDA approval, if we or others later identify previously unknown undesirable side effects caused by our drug or concentrate products, if known side effects are more frequent or severe than in the past, or if we or others detect unexpected safety signals for such products or any products perceived to be similar to such products, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may require the addition of unfavorable labeling statements, specific warnings or contraindications, may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, may require it to be removed from the market or may impose restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. Such side effects may also result in litigation against the Company by private litigants.\nWe maintain products liability insurance in the amount of $10 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate. We cannot be sure that such insurance would be sufficient to protect us against liabilities associated with any of these events in view of our expanding business or that such insurance will remain available at economical levels. We may have significant legal expenses that are not covered by insurance. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by such sanctions or product liability litigation and that could harm our marketing ability. Any such sanctions or litigation could also hurt our ability to retain products liability insurance or make such insurance more expensive. In any such event, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain certain debt financing in the future as a result of our arrangement with Baxter.\nThe Distribution Agreement prohibits us from entering into a contract encumbering the assets used in our concentrate business without the prior written consent of Baxter, and Baxter would be under no obligation to provide us with consent. The assets used in our concentrate business currently constitute a substantial portion of the tangible assets we own. If our development activities require substantial cash resources in the future in excess of our liquid resources on hand and if our cash flows are not sufficient to support financing through unsecured indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain debt financing and our capital financing options may become limited. If we are unable to obtain this type of debt financing, our business and our future development and expansion strategies may be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nShares eligible for future sale may affect the market price of our common shares.\nAny future sales by us of substantial amounts of our common shares, or the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and also impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities in the future. In the future, we may issue additional shares or warrants in connection with investments or for other purposes considered advisable by our Board of Directors. Any substantial sale of our common shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and may dilute the economic value and voting rights of existing shareholders.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2016, there were 5,989,335 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding and exercisable stock options, 1,702,166 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options that are not yet exercisable and 545,694 additional shares available for future grant under our 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan. The market price of the common shares may be depressed by the potential exercise of these options. The holders of these options are likely to exercise them when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional capital on more favorable terms than those provided by the options.\nThe market price for our common stock is volatile.\nOur stock price, like the market price of many stocks in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Events such as announcements around clinical testing results or regulatory approval of a product, as well as the reporting of sales, operating results and cash resources, may cause significant fluctuations in our share price. In addition, third parties may engage in trading strategies that result in intentional volatility to and control over our share price.\nWe could have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which, until remedied, could result in errors in our financial statements requiring restatement of our financial statements. As a result, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nSEC rules require us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is possible, due to the small size of our accounting staff, that we may identify control deficiencies in the future that constitute one or more material weaknesses. If our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, there may be errors in our financial statements and in our disclosure that could require restatements. Investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and in our disclosure, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nNo system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. As a result, we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future.\nStructural and anti-takeover provisions reduce the likelihood that you will receive a takeover premium.\nThe Board of Directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock having such rights, preferences and privileges as the Board of Directors may determine. Any such issuance of preferred stock could, under certain circumstances, have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the rights of holders of common shares, including by decreasing the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of common shares and adversely affect the relative voting power or other rights of the holders of the common shares. In addition, we may become subject to Michigan statutes regulating business combinations or our Board may take other actions which might also hinder or delay a change in control. Any such actions can have a depressive effect on the market price of our common shares and can limit shareholders\u2019 ability to receive a premium on their shares by discouraging takeover and tender offers.\nOur shareholders do not have the right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Moreover, our directors serve staggered three-year terms, and directors may not be removed without cause. These provisions could have an anti-takeover effect by making it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove incumbent directors. These provisions could delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his or her best interests, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the common shares.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nSince inception, we have not paid any cash dividend on our common shares and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and requirements, future prospects, restrictions in future financing agreements, business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. We intend to retain earnings and any cash resources to finance our operations. Therefore, it is highly unlikely we will pay cash dividends.", "PERMNO": 85744, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "RMTI"}
