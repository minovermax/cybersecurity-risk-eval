RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to numerous risks, many of which are inherent to our business. As a financial services organization, we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities. For information about how our risk oversight and management process operates, see Item 7 of this Report, MD&A - \"Risk Management.\u201d The following discussion highlights specific risks that could affect us and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Based on the information currently known, we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting us. The risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Report. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\n1. Global/Regional Market and Environmental Influences\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain and will be impacted by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and U.S. economies and financial markets and is having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 has caused death, illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of the states in which we have branch offices, and of most other states, have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes. These restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, and have resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide and in the regions in which we operate.\nThe ultimate effects of COVID-19 on the broader economy and the markets that we serve are not known nor is the ultimate length of the restrictions described above and any accompanying effects. Moreover, the FOMC has taken action to lower the Federal Funds rate, which may negatively affect our interest income and, therefore, earnings, financial condition and results of operations. Additional impacts of COVID-19 on our business could be widespread and material, and may include, or exacerbate, among other consequences, the following:\n\u2022employees, including, key executives, contracting COVID-19;\n\u2022reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home;\n\u2022a work stoppage, forced quarantine, or other interruption of our business;\n\u2022unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities;\n\u2022effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022sustained longer-term closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers;\n\u2022declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products;\n\u2022reduced consumer spending due to both job losses and other effects attributable to COVID-19;\n\u2022unprecedented volatility in U.S. financial markets;\n\u2022volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio;\n\u2022decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets we serve, leading to a need to increase our ACL and the potential for higher loan losses;\n\u2022declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n\u2022declines in demand resulting from businesses being deemed to be \u201cnon-essential\u201d by governments in the markets we serve, and from \u201cnon-essential\u201d and \u201cessential\u201d businesses suffering adverse effects from reduced levels of economic activity in our markets.\nThese factors, together or in combination with other events or occurrences that are not yet known or anticipated, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies, including the financial services sector, as well as the trading prices for many other securities. The further spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as ongoing or new governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, may materially disrupt banking and other economic activity generally and in the geographic areas in which we operate. This could result in further decline in demand for our banking products and services, and could negatively impact, among other things, our liquidity, regulatory capital and our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or deemed to be appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employee\u2019s ability to provide customer support and service. If we are unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions, which could further adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional COVID-19 outbreaks, spikes and \"second or subsequent\" waves, new COVID-19 strains and widespread ineffectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines may lead to efforts by federal, state and local governments and health authorities to engage in efforts to contain or mitigate the pandemic's impact.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency may continue to cause significant disruption in the U.S. economy and the U.S. financial and labor markets by imposing or extending restrictions on movement or business activities. Additionally, the potential expiration of the current fiscal unemployment relief or the failure to provide for additional COVID-19 related stimulus relief may adversely impact our business and financial performance by prolonging the U.S. economic recovery and possibly adversely impact the demand and profitability of our products and services, the valuation of assets and our ability to meet the financial and banking needs of our clients.\nInterest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to LIBOR, which could adversely affect revenue, expenses, and the value of those financial instruments.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The ARRC, a committee of U.S. financial market participants, has recommended the SOFR as the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in\nderivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to U.S. dollar-LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan from LIBOR to SOFR and organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. We have a significant number of loans, derivatives and other financial instrument contracts that are indexed to LIBOR and are actively monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, our floating rate loans, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022adversely affect the value of our floating rate loans, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts; and\n\u2022require the transition to, or development of, appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark.\nThe impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nOur business could be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions in the regions in which we operate.\nWe operate in seven states and the District of Columbia. Our market coverage spans several major metropolitan areas including: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; and Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and the Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point) in North Carolina. Most of our customers are individuals and small- and medium-sized businesses that are dependent upon their regional economies. The economic conditions in these local markets may be different from, and in some instances worse than, economic conditions in the U.S. as a whole. Difficult economic and employment conditions in the market areas FNB serves could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022demand for our loans, deposits and services may decline;\n\u2022loan delinquencies, problem assets, foreclosures and charge-offs may increase;\n\u2022weak economic conditions could limit the demand for loans by creditworthy borrowers, limiting our capacity to leverage our retail deposits and maintain our net interest income;\n\u2022collateral for our loans may decline in value; and\n\u2022the amount of our low-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nHurricanes, excessive rainfall, droughts or other adverse weather events could negatively affect the local economies in the North Carolina and South Carolina markets, or disrupt our operations in those markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe economy of the coastal regions of North Carolina and South Carolina is affected, from time to time, by adverse weather events, particularly hurricanes. Our market area includes the Outer Banks and other portions of coastal North Carolina. Agricultural interests are highly sensitive to excessive rainfall or droughts. We cannot predict whether, or to what extent, damage caused by future weather conditions will affect our operations, customers or the economies in our North Carolina and South Carolina markets. Weather events could cause a disruption in our day-to-day business activities in branches located in coastal communities, a decline in loan originations, destruction or decline in the value of properties securing our loans, or an increase in the risks of delinquencies, foreclosures, and loan losses. Even if a hurricane does not cause any physical damage in our North Carolina and South Carolina market areas, a turbulent hurricane season could significantly affect the market value of all coastal property.\n2. Lending\nAs a participating lender in the SBA PPP, we are subject to additional regulatory and DOJ enforcement risks and the risk of litigation from FNBPA\u2019s clients or other parties regarding FNBPA\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nUnder the CARES Act, enacted in March 2020, Congress allocated $349 billion for the PPP loan program to be administered through the SBA. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals applied for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enrolled in the program, subject to various limitations and eligibility criteria. FNBPA participated as a lender in the PPP beginning in April 2020. From the beginning of the PPP, there has been ambiguity and continuously evolving rules, interpretations and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP and the respective obligations of banks and loan applicants, which has exposed banks to risks relating to non-compliance with the PPP by various government investigative agencies and the DOJ, who are charged with investigating PPP loan fraud and pursuing civil and criminal sanctions. Congress has approved additional funding for the PPP and beginning in January 2021, FNBPA elected to participate in the second round of PPP loans. Since the opening of the PPP, several larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. We may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both clients and non-clients that approached FNBPA regarding PPP loans, regarding our process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial, civil or criminal liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNBPA also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, underwritten, certified by the borrower, funded, or serviced by FNBPA, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, certified by the borrower, funded, or serviced by FNBPA, the SBA may deny its liability under its loan guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, deny forgiveness of a PPP loan or, if it has already paid under the guaranty or honored the loan forgiveness, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nOur results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\nLending money is an essential part of the banking business. However, for various reasons, borrowers do not always repay their loans. The risk of non-payment is affected by:\n\u2022credit risks of a particular borrower;\n\u2022changes in economic conditions that impact certain geographic markets or industries;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate loans;\n\u2022the duration of the loan; and\n\u2022in the case of a collateralized loan, uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral.\nGenerally, commercial loans and leases present a greater risk of non-payment by a borrower than other types of loans. They typically involve larger loan balances and are particularly sensitive to economic conditions. The borrower\u2019s ability to repay usually depends on the successful operation of its business and income stream. In addition, some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us, which means that an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss. In the case of commercial and industrial loans, collateral often consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, which may not yield substantial recovery of principal losses incurred, and is susceptible to deterioration or other loss in advance of liquidation of such collateral. These types of loans, however, have historically driven the growth in our loan portfolio and we intend to continue our lending efforts for commercial and industrial products. At December 31, 2020, commercial loans and leases comprised 68.6% of our loan portfolio and consumer loans comprised 31.4% of our loan portfolio. Consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to real estate mortgage loans, but generally carry higher risks of default. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. For additional information, see the Lending Activity section of MD&A, which is included in Item 7 of this Report.\nOur mortgage banking profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to originate and resell a high volume of mortgage loans.\nMortgage banking is generally considered a volatile source of income because it depends largely on the volume of loans we originate and sell in the secondary market. If our originations of mortgage loans decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors, this would result in a decrease in mortgage revenues and a corresponding decrease in non-interest income.\n\u2022Mortgage loan production levels are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and activity, strengths or weaknesses in the housing market and interest rate fluctuations. Generally, any sustained period of decreased economic activity or higher interest rates could reduce demand for mortgage loans and refinancings. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of non-interest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations.\n\u2022Our ability to originate and resell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market. GSEs, including FHLB, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these GSEs could, in turn, adversely affect our mortgage banking business. In September 2008, the GSEs were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorship will end, or any associated changes to the business structure and operations of the GSEs that could result. Additionally, there are various proposals to reform the role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing finance market. The extent and timing of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the GSEs are uncertain.\n\u2022Future changes to our eligibility to participate in the programs offered by the GSEs and other secondary purchasers, or the loan criteria of the GSEs and other secondary purchasers could also result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we must further increase our provision for credit losses or if our ACL is not sufficient to absorb actual losses.\nThere is no precise method of predicting loan losses. We can give no assurance that our ACL will be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses. Excess loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We attempt to maintain an appropriate ACL to provide for estimated current expected credit losses in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding reporting date based on various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio. We regularly determine the amount of our ACL based upon consideration of several quantitative and qualitative factors including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022a regular review of the quality, mix and size of the overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022historical loan loss experience;\n\u2022evaluation of non-performing loans;\n\u2022geographic or industry concentrations;\n\u2022assessment of economic conditions and their effects on FNB\u2019s existing portfolio;\n\u2022the amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing loans; and\n\u2022geographic or industry economic market conditions.\nThe level of the ACL reflects the judgment and estimates of management regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, current fair value of the underlying collateral and other qualitative risk factors that may affect the loan. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective and is based on factors that are susceptible to significant change. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ACL. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ACL and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ACL, we will need additional provisions to increase the ACL. Any increases in the ACL will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor additional discussion relating to this matter, refer to the Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses section of MD&A, which is included in Item 7 of this Report.\nChanges in economic conditions, the impact of COVID-19 and the composition of our loan portfolio could lead to higher loan charge-offs or an increase in our provision for credit losses and may reduce our net income.\nChanges in national and regional economic conditions, and in large metropolitan areas within our market, including the economic impact of COVID-19, continue to impact our loan portfolios. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or changes in interest rates, as well as other factors, could weaken the economies of the communities we serve. Weakness in the market areas served by FNB could depress our earnings and consequently our financial condition because customers may not want or need our products or services; borrowers may not be able to repay their loans; the value of the collateral securing our loans to borrowers may decline; and the quality of our loan portfolio may decline. Any of the latter three scenarios could require us to charge-off a higher percentage of our loans and/or increase our provision for credit losses, which would reduce our net income. Additionally, changes to macroeconomic conditions and the related CECL modeling considerations may result in volatility in our provision from period to period.\n3. Goodwill\nDeclines in the fair value of our reporting units could result in a goodwill impairment charge and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 impacted worldwide economic conditions and the resulting adverse effects to stock market capitalization negatively impact the valuation of goodwill assets. Goodwill is periodically tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, then the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. The fair value of a reporting unit is impacted by the reporting unit\u2019s expected financial performance and susceptibility to adverse economic, regulatory and legislative changes. The most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including projections of earnings, the discount rates used in the income approach to fair value and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of FNB. While these factors provide some relative market information about the estimated fair value of the reporting units, they are not individually determinative and need to be evaluated in the context of the current economic environment. However, significant and sustained declines in our market capitalization or other factors could be an indication of potential goodwill impairment.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. If any estimates, market factors, or assumptions change in the future, these amounts are susceptible to impairments. For additional discussion related to goodwill, refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\n4. Growth Trends\nIf we are not able to continue our historical levels of growth, we may not be able to maintain our historical revenue trends.\nTo achieve our past levels of growth, we have focused on both organic growth and acquisitions. We may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the opening of new retail branches or optimizing our existing branch network. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect our internal growth. If we are not able to continue our historical levels of growth, we may not be able to maintain our historical revenue trends.\nOur growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations (see discussion under \u201cGovernment Supervision and Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Report). As a financial holding company, we seek to maintain capital sufficient to meet the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standard set by regulators. We anticipate that our current capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support continued growth, whether such growth occurs organically or through acquisitions.\nThe availability of additional capital or financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry,\nour credit ratings and credit capacity, marketability of our stock, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large credit losses or if the level of business activity decreases due to economic conditions. Accordingly, there can be no assurance of our ability to expand our operations through internal growth or acquisitions. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than desired or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, it could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\n5. Regulations, Tax Laws and Political Impacts\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations.\nOur income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items. The new Presidential Administration approach to corporate tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the federal tax rates and in tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation of our DTAs and DTLs. Changes in statutory tax rates or DTAs and DTLs may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market rates and changes in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the UST and the FRB, have a direct impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which may not be able to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.\nAs a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. Such scenarios may include the following:\n\u2022changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that FNBPA can earn on assets and the interest that FNBPA has to pay on liabilities, which impacts FNBPA\u2019s overall net interest income and profitability;\n\u2022such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments and can, in turn, affect our loss rates on those assets;\n\u2022such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate-based products or services, including bank loans and deposit products and the subordinated notes offered by our subsidiary, FNB Financial Services, LP;\n\u2022such changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risks and may decrease the profitability or increase the risk associated with such hedges; and\n\u2022movements in interest rates also affect mortgage repayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.\nThe monetary, tax and other policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies also have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the FRB influence the rates of interest that FNBPA may charge on loans and what FNBPA may pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of FNB\u2019s and FNBPA\u2019s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Principally due to the impact of rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the FRB, the FRB\u2019s policies also influence to a significant extent, FNBPA\u2019s cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, fiscal, tax and other policies or the effects that may be implemented by the current Administration or a newly elected Administration and that they may have on FNBPA\u2019s and other affiliates\u2019 activities and financial results.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting policies, standards and interpretations.\nThe FASB, regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.\nSignificant recent guidance issued was FASB ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), commonly referred to as \u201cCECL,\u201d which introduced new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. CECL requires loss estimates for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical experience, current conditions, and R&S forecasts. It also modifies the impairment model for debt securities AFS and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. For further information regarding new or updated standards, see Note 2, \u201cNew Accounting Standards\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges in the federal, state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to legislative tax rate changes that could increase our effective tax rates. Depending on enactment dates, these law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. For example, the TCJA resulted in a reduction in our corporate tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018, which has a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities, however, the new Presidential Administration has announced that modification of corporate tax rates is a priority. In addition, the TCJA also enacted limitations on certain deductions, such as the deduction of FDIC deposit insurance premiums, which will partially offset the anticipated increase in net earnings from the lower tax rate. The impact of the TCJA may differ from the foregoing, possibly materially, due to changes in interpretations or in assumptions that we have made, guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, and other actions that we may take as a result of the TCJA. Similarly, FNB\u2019s customers are likely to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the TCJA and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in the law, especially changes in the regulation of the banking industry.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and our businesses are subject to supervision and regulation by several governmental agencies, including the SEC, FRB, OCC, CFPB, FDIC, FSOC, DOJ, UST, FINRA, HUD and state attorneys general and banking, financial services, and securities regulators. Regulations are generally intended to provide protection for depositors, borrowers and other customers, as well as the stability of the financial services industry, rather than for investors in our securities. We are subject to changes in federal and state law, regulations, governmental policies, agency supervisory and enforcement policies and priorities, and tax laws and accounting principles. Changes in regulations or the regulatory environment could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry as a whole and could limit our growth and the return to investors by restricting such activities as, for example:\n\u2022the payment of dividends and stock repurchases;\n\u2022balance sheet growth;\n\u2022investments;\n\u2022loans and interest rates;\n\u2022assessments of fees, such as overdraft and electronic transfer interchange fees;\n\u2022the provision of securities, insurance, brokerage or trust services;\n\u2022mergers with or acquisitions of other institutions or branches;\n\u2022the types of non-deposit activities in which our subsidiaries may engage; and\n\u2022offering of new products and services.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements, FNB and FNBPA must meet guidelines subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. From time to time, the\nregulators implement changes to those regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Changes to present capital and liquidity requirements could restrict our activities and require us to maintain additional capital. Compliance with heightened capital standards may reduce our ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets and thereby restrict revenue generation from banking and non-banking operations. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough significant changes to existing laws, regulations and policies may be proposed by the new Presidential Administration and implemented by Congress and/or the federal banking agencies and the CFPB, it is difficult to predict with precision the changes that will be implemented into law and when such changes may occur. Accordingly, the impact of any legislative or regulatory changes on our competitors and on the financial services industry as a whole cannot be determined at this time. In any event, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly under review by Congress, federal regulatory agencies, and state authorities. These laws and regulations could be changed drastically in the future, which could affect our profitability, our ability to compete effectively, or the composition of the financial services industry in which we compete.\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and Pennsylvania law may discourage takeovers.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may discourage or may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our Board of Directors. In particular, our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws:\n\u2022require shareholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to our Board of Directors or to make shareholder proposals at a shareholders\u2019 meeting;\n\u2022permit our Board of Directors to issue, without approval of our common shareholders unless otherwise required by law, preferred stock with such terms as our Board of Directors may determine;\n\u2022require the vote of the holders of at least 75% of our voting shares for shareholder amendments to our By-laws;\n\u2022in the case of a proposed business combination with a shareholder owning 10% or more of the voting shares of FNB, the vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting shares not owned by such shareholder is required to approve the business combination, unless it is approved by a majority of FNB\u2019s disinterested directors.\nUnder Pennsylvania law, only shareholders holding at least 25% of a corporation\u2019s outstanding stock may call a special meeting for any purpose. In addition, Pennsylvania law provides that in discharging their duties, including in the context of a takeover attempt, the board of directors, committees of the board and individual directors may consider a broad range of factors as they deem pertinent, which may include but is not limited to shareholders\u2019 interests, in considering the best interests of the corporation.\nThese provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and of Pennsylvania law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though the holders of a majority of our stock may consider such proposals desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace members of our Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions could diminish the opportunities for shareholders to participate in certain tender offers, including tender offers at prices above the then-current market price of our common stock, and may also inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts.\n6. Liquidity\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy will depend on our liquidity and ability to obtain funding for loan originations, working capital and other general purposes. Liquidity is needed to fund various obligations, including credit commitments to borrowers, mortgage and other loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of borrowings, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or pay regular dividends on our common stock because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Our preferred sources for funding are deposits and customer repurchase agreements, which are low cost and stable sources of funding for us. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions, as well as non-depository competitors such as mutual funds, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies, for deposits and customer repurchase agreements. If we are unable to attract and maintain sufficient levels of deposits and customer repurchase agreements to fund our loan growth and liquidity objectives, we may be subject to paying higher funding costs by raising\ninterest rates that are paid on deposits and customer repurchase agreements or cause us to source funds from third-party providers which may be higher cost funding.\nSecondary sources of liquidity include principal and interest payments on loans; principal and interest payments on investment securities; sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations; FHLB advances and subordinated notes issued through one of our subsidiaries, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us.\nOur liquidity and ability to fund and run our business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, us or the financial services industry generally, which could result in a loss of deposits and negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets and to sell or securitize loans or other assets. If we are unable to continue to fund assets through deposits and customer repurchase agreements or access funding sources on favorable terms, or if we suffer an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage liquidity effectively, our liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n7. Financial Industry\nThe financial soundness of other financial institutions may adversely affect FNB, FNBPA and other affiliates.\nFinancial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. FNB, FNBPA and other affiliates are exposed to many different industries and counterparties and they routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these types of transactions expose FNB, FNBPA and other affiliates to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty or client. In addition, FNBPA and other affiliates\u2019 credit risks may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure that we are due.\nWe are subject to operational risk that could damage our reputation and our business. We engage in a variety of businesses in diverse markets and rely on systems, employees, service providers and counterparties to properly process a high volume of transactions.\nLike all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes in our systems, human error and external events. Operational risk also encompasses technology, compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of FNB\u2019s and our subsidiaries\u2019 noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. Many strategic initiatives, such as development of new products, product enhancements, use of technology, staffing reductions, changes in business processes and acquisitions of other financial services companies or their assets, could substantially increase operational risk. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect the changes in circumstances or capabilities of FNB\u2019s outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to FNB\u2019s business. We outsource certain data processing and online and mobile banking services to third-party providers. Those third-party providers could also be sources of operational and information security risk to FNB, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Although we take steps to mitigate operational risks through a system of internal controls which we review on a regular basis and update as required, no system of controls - however well designed and maintained - is infallible, and, to the extent the risks arise from the operations of third-party vendors or customers, we have limited ability to control those risks. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risk could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, inability to secure insurance, civil litigation, regulatory intervention, including enforcement action and enhanced supervisory scrutiny, foregone business opportunities, the loss of customer business, especially if customers are discouraged from using our mobile bill pay, mobile banking and online banking services, or the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary information.\nAdditionally, we may seek growth by acquiring financial institutions and branches as well as non-depository entities engaged in permissible activities for our financial institution subsidiaries. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, as well as difficulties and complications in integrating expanded operations and new employees without disruption to our overall operations. Following each acquisition, we must expend substantial resources to integrate the entities. The integration of non-banking entities often involves combining different industry cultures and business methodologies. The failure to integrate acquired entities successfully with our existing operations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. As we grow, our regulatory costs also may become more significant.\nIn addition to acquisitions, we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets by undertaking additional de novo branch openings. Based on our experience, we believe that it generally takes up to three years for new banking facilities to achieve operational profitability due to the impact of organizational and overhead expenses and the start-up phase of generating loans and deposits. To the extent that we undertake additional de novo branch openings or branch acquisitions, we are likely to continue to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new banking facilities, which may have an adverse effect on our net income, earnings per share, return on average stockholders\u2019 equity and return on average assets.\nThe financial services industry is experiencing leadership changes at the federal banking agencies, which may impact regulations and government policies applicable to us.\nThe former Presidential Administration had advocated and pursued approaches to reduce financial services banking regulation, supervision and enforcement. The new Presidential Administration is anticipated to advocate a more expansive regulatory, supervisory and enforcement approach and its appointment of the federal bank regulatory agencies' leadership positions will likely reflect this change. At this time, the full impact of the new Presidential Administration's approach to financial services regulation is uncertain. Likewise, it is also difficult to predict the impact that any legislative or regulatory changes will have on our competitors and on the financial services industry as a whole. Regardless, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes, regulations, and laws are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies as advocated by the current or a new Administration.\nIncreases in or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings.\nIn order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the DIF, the FDIC has increased assessment rates of insured institutions. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF was increased from 1.15% to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits, or the assessment base, and the FDIC was directed to take the steps needed to cause the reserve ratio of the DIF to reach 1.35% of estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020. The DIF achieved this level in the third quarter of 2018. As part of its long-range management plan to ensure that the DIF is able to maintain a positive balance despite banking crises and steady, moderate assessment rates, despite economic and credit cycles, the FDIC set the DIF\u2019s designated reserve ratio at 2% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC is required to offset the effect of the increased minimum reserve ratio for banks with assets of less than $10 billion, so smaller community banks will be spared the cost of funding the increase in the minimum reserve ratio. Moreover, as a result of the TCJA\u2019s disallowance of the deduction of FDIC deposit insurance premium payments for certain banking organizations, the after-tax cost of our deposit insurance premium payments has increased.\nWe generally have limited ability to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. Any future increases in or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In light of our status as a large bank, FNBPA may be required to pay additional amounts to the DIF, which could have an adverse effect on our earnings. If FNBPA\u2019s deposit insurance premium assessment rate increases again, either because of our risk classification, a change in the concentration of our loan portfolio, emergency assessments, or because of another uniform increase, our earnings could be further adversely impacted.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually encounters technological change, especially in the systems that are used to deliver products to, and execute transactions on behalf of, customers, and if we fail to continue to invest in technological improvements as they become appropriate or necessary, our ability to compete effectively could be severely impaired.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually undergoes technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better compete for and serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address customer needs by using secure technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our larger competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or do so as quickly as our competitors. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the banking and financial services industry could negatively affect our revenue and profitability.\n8. Cybersecurity\nAn interruption in or breach in security of our information systems, or other cybersecurity risks, could result in a loss of customer business, increased compliance and remediation costs, civil litigation or governmental regulatory action, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs part of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information in both paper and electronic form and rely heavily on communications and information systems for these functions. This information includes non-public, personally-identifiable information that is protected under applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, certain of these data processing functions are not handled by us directly, but are outsourced to third-party providers. We devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, including adoption of policies and procedures that involve our third-party providers to prevent, detect and deter cyber-related crimes intended to infiltrate our networks, capture sensitive client and customer information, deny service to customers, or harm electronic processing capabilities and be ready to respond, if necessary. Despite these efforts, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism and other physical security threats, computer viruses or compromises, ransomware attacks, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of our confidential business, employee or customer information, whether originating with us, our vendors or retail businesses, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of civil litigation and liability, require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking of costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a security breach, disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe additional cost of our day-to-day cybersecurity monitoring and protection systems and controls includes the cost of hardware and software, third-party technology providers, consulting and forensic testing firms, insurance premium costs and legal fees, in addition to the incremental cost of our personnel who focus a substantial portion of their responsibilities on cybersecurity. We may also need to expend substantial resources to comply with the data security breach notification requirements adopted by banking regulators and the states, which have varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification and remediation requirements in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach.\nCybersecurity risks appear to be growing and, as a result, the cyber-resilience of banking organizations is of increased importance to federal and state banking agencies and other regulators. New or revised laws and regulations may significantly impact our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and current or planned business activities. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nIn the last few years, there have been an increasing number of cyber incidents, including several well-publicized cyber-attacks that targeted other U.S. companies, including financial services companies much larger than us. These cyber incidents have been initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. As technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has also become more widely distributed among mobile devices, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access points, some of which are not controlled or secured by FNB. It is possible that we could have exposure to liability and suffer losses as a result of a security breach or cyber-attack that occurred through no fault of FNB. Further, the probability of a successful cyber attack against us or one of our third-party services providers cannot be predicted. Although we maintain specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. In addition, cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, several of which may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage. As cyber threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to spend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective and preventative measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\n9. Reputation\nOur key assets include our brand and reputation and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the market place.\nOur brand and our reputation are key assets of FNB. Our ability to attract and retain banking, insurance, wealth management and corporate clients and employees is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our culture, level of service, security, trustworthiness, business practices and financial condition. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could\ndamage our reputation among existing customers and corporate clients and employees, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones. Adverse developments with respect to the financial services industry or sociopolitical events and circumstances may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n10. Human and Vendor Resources\nOur day-to-day operations rely heavily on the proper functioning of products, information systems and services provided by third-party, external vendors.\nWe rely on certain external vendors to provide products, information systems and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully and we oversee their provision of service to us in accordance with applicable enterprise risk management and third-party vendor risk management standards and in a manner consistent with the supervisory expectations of our regulators, we cannot control the actions of our third-party vendors entirely. Any complications caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to conform to our internal controls and risk management procedures, and failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to provide services. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Problems caused by external vendors could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to continue to recruit and retain qualified banking professionals could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully and affect our profitability.\nOur continued success and future growth depends heavily on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled, diverse and motivated banking professionals. We compete against many institutions with greater financial resources both within our industry and in other industries to attract these qualified individuals. Our failure to recruit and retain adequate talent could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our business and profitability.\n11. Modeling Assumptions\nThere may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, developing strategic planning initiatives, capital stress testing and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and Balance Sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of such information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to our stockholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator\u2019s perception that the quality of the models used to generate our relevant information is insufficient.\nOur asset valuations may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and this, along with market factors such as volatility in one or more markets or industries, could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets are measured and reported at fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Because the assets are carried at fair value, a decline in their value may cause us to incur losses even if the assets in question present minimal risk. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable\ninputs provided by independent third-party resources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relative inputs. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying these estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be more difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. In such cases, valuations in certain asset classes may require more subjectivity and management discretion; valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any particular market (e.g., credit, equity, fixed income) could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly.\nWe may be required to record future impairment charges if the declines in asset values are considered other-than-temporary. If the impairment charges are significant enough, they could affect the ability of FNBPA to pay dividends to FNB (which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders), and could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios and result in FNBPA not being classified as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for regulatory purposes.\n12. Investment in Securities\nWe are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends to stockholders.\nWe are a holding company and conduct almost all of our operations through our subsidiaries. We do not have any significant assets other than cash and the stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders. Our right to participate in any distribution of earnings or assets of our subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiaries. Under federal law, the amount of dividends that a national bank, such as FNBPA, may pay in a calendar year is dependent on the amount of our net income for the current year combined with our retained net income for the two preceding years. The OCC has the authority to prohibit FNBPA from paying dividends if it determines such payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Likewise, FNB\u2019s state-based entities are subject to state laws governing dividend practices and payments.\nRegulatory authorities may restrict our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock.\nDividends on our common stock will be payable only if, when and as authorized and declared by our Board of Directors. In addition, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases. For example, our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, is subject to the review and non-objection of our annual capital plan by the FRB. In certain circumstances, we will not be able to make a capital distribution unless the FRB has approved such distribution, including if the dividend could not be fully funded by our net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid), our prospective rate of earnings retention appears inconsistent with our capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition, or we will not be able to continue meeting minimum required capital ratios. As a bank holding company, we also are required to consult with the FRB before increasing dividends or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. Additionally, the FRB could prohibit or limit our payment of dividends if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future.\nWe have outstanding securities senior to the common stock which could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have outstanding TPS and Series E preferred stock that are senior to the common stock and could adversely affect our ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on our common stock. The terms of the TPS prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends or making distributions on our junior capital stock, including the common stock, or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on any junior capital stock, if: (1) an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the junior subordinated debentures underlying the TPS, (2) we are in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related TPS or (3) we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments, but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. We also would be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock unless all full dividends for the latest dividend period have been declared and paid on all outstanding shares of the Series E preferred stock. If we experience a material deterioration in our financial condition, liquidity, capital, results of\noperations or risk profile, our regulators may not permit us to make future payments on our TPS or preferred stock, which would also prevent us from paying any dividends on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 10629, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FNB"}
