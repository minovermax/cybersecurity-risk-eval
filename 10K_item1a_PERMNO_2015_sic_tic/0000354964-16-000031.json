{"cik": "354964", "company": "HSBC Finance Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following discussion provides a description of some of the most significant risk factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in public statements or documents. Some of these risk factors are inherent in the financial services industry and others are more specific to our own businesses. There are also other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that could also affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and, therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of all potential risks that we may face.\nThe current uncertain market and economic conditions may continue to affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business and earnings are affected by general business, economic and market conditions in the United States and abroad. Uncertainties remain concerning the outlook and the future economic environment despite recent improvements in certain segments of the global economy. There can be no assurance that the global economy as a whole will improve significantly or at all. Given our concentration of business activities in the United States and due to the nature of our historical business as a consumer lender to generally non-conforming and non-prime customers, we are particularly exposed to any additional turmoil in the economy, housing downturns, high unemployment, tight credit conditions and reduced economic growth. While the U.S. economy continued to improve during 2015, challenges remain. General business, economic and market conditions that could continue to affect us include:\n\u2022\nlevel of economic growth and the pace and magnitude of the recovery;\n\u2022\npressure on consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending from other economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nfiscal policy;\n\u2022\nunemployment levels;\n\u2022\nwage income levels and declines in wealth;\n\u2022\nmarket value of residential real estate throughout the United States;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nmonetary supply and monetary policy;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets;\n\u2022\nunexpected geopolitical events, natural disasters, pandemics or acts of war or terrorism;\n\u2022\nmovements in short-term and long-term interest rates, a change in the shape of the yield curve or a prolonged period of low or negative interest rates;\n\u2022\navailability of liquidity;\n\u2022\ntight consumer credit conditions;\n\u2022\nbankruptcy filings levels and heightened scrutiny by various U.S. Bankruptcy Trustees of proofs of claim and other documents filed by creditors in consumer bankruptcy cases; and\nHSBC Finance Corporation\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations or regulatory and law enforcement initiatives.\nAlthough unemployment rates have improved in 2015 and housing market conditions in the U.S. continue to recover, if businesses were again to become cautious to hire, lay-off employees or reduce hours for employees, losses could be significant in our consumer receivable portfolios due to decreased consumer income. While the U.S. economy continued to improve in 2015, the sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment, energy prices, credit market volatility, employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets. In the event economic conditions stop improving or become depressed again and lead to a recession, there would be a significant negative impact on delinquencies, charge-offs and losses in all receivable portfolios with a corresponding impact on our results of operations.\nWhile the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of the recovery varies by market. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to increased delays in several jurisdictions which will continue to take time to resolve.\nFederal, state and other similar international measures to regulate the financial industry may significantly impact our operations. We operate in a highly regulated environment. Changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting banking, capital, liquidity, consumer credit, bankruptcy, privacy, consumer protection or other matters, including changes in tax rates, could materially impact our operations and performance. The U.S. Congress and the Administration have indicated an interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income tax code. Possible approaches include lowering the 35 percent corporate tax rate, modifying the taxation of income earned outside the U.S. and limiting or eliminating various other deductions, tax credits and/or other tax preferences.\nAttempts by local, state and national regulatory agencies to address perceived problems with the mortgage lending industry and, more recently, to address additional perceived problems in the financial services industry generally through broad or targeted legislative or regulatory initiatives aimed at lenders\u2019 operations in consumer lending markets, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including how consumer lending accounts are serviced, limiting the fees and charges that may be applied to accounts and how accounts may be collected or security interests enforced. Any one or more of these effects could negatively impact our results. There is also significant focus on loss mitigation and foreclosure activity for real estate receivables. We cannot fully anticipate the response by national regulatory agencies, state Attorneys General, or certain legislators, or if significant changes to our operations and practices will be required as a result.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB which has broad authority to regulate providers of credit, payment and other consumer financial products and services. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may also narrow the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws and expand the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act's potential expansion of the authority of state Attorneys General to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, we could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs. Although we are unable to predict what specific measures this new agency may take in applying its regulatory mandate, any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in our consumer businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses.\nThe total impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators will respond to the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations under the legislation, and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations will affect our businesses and operations. Additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States, the European Union or in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities for the sale of our portfolio or the run-off of certain products, affect the value of assets that we hold, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Accordingly, any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn November 2015, the Financial Stability Board (\"FSB\") issued final standards for total loss-absorbing capacity (\u201cTLAC\u201d) requirements for global systemically important banks (\"G-SIBs\"), which will apply to our ultimate parent HSBC once implemented in the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"). The new standard also permits authorities in host jurisdictions to require \u201cinternal\u201d TLAC to be prepositioned (issued by local entities to either parent entities or third parties). The purpose of this new standard is to ensure that G-SIBs have sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity available to implement an orderly resolution with continuity of critical functions and minimal impact on financial stability, and to ensure cooperation between home and host authorities during resolution. The new standard calls for all G-SIBs to be subject to TLAC requirements starting January 1, 2019, to be fully phased in January 1, 2022. In the United States, the Federal Reserve published proposed rules on October 30, 2015 that would implement in the United States the FSB\u2019s TLAC standard. The proposed rules would require, among other things, the U.S. intermediate holding companies of non-US G-SIBs, including HSBC North America, to maintain minimum amounts of \u201cinternal\u201d TLAC, which would include minimum levels of TLAC and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer\nHSBC Finance Corporation\ncommencing January 1, 2019. The TLAC Proposal would also include \u201cclean holding company requirements\u201d that impose limitations on the types of financial transactions HSBC\u2019s U.S. intermediate holding company, HSBC North America, could engage in. The FSB\u2019s TLAC standard and the Federal Reserve\u2019s TLAC proposal represent a significant expansion of the current regulatory capital framework that may, if adopted as proposed, require both HSBC North America and HSBC to make material modifications to the terms of outstanding debt instruments or to issue additional long term debt.\nRegulators in the European Union (\"EU\") and in the U.K. are in the midst of proposing far-reaching programs of financial regulatory reform. These proposals include enhanced capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, changes in compensation practices (including tax levies), separation of retail and wholesale banking, the recovery and resolution of EU financial institutions, amendments to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the Market Abuse Directive, and measures to address systemic risk. The implementation of regulations and rules promulgated by these bodies could result in additional costs or limit or restrict the way HSBC conducts its businesses in the EU and in the U.K. Furthermore, the potentially far-reaching effects of future changes in laws, rules or regulations, or in their interpretation or enforcement as a result of EU or U.K. legislation and regulation are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.\nThe transition to the new requirements under Basel III will continue to put significant pressure on regulatory capital and liquidity. HSBC North America is required to meet consolidated regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, including new or modified regulations and regulatory guidance, in accordance with current regulatory timelines. We will continue to support HSBC North America's compliance with U.S. regulatory requirements, therefore the results of broader regulatory change could impact the availability of funding for us.\nIn December 2010, the Basel Committee issued \u201cBasel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems\u201d (the \u201cBasel III Capital Framework\u201d) and \u201cInternational framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring\u201d (the \u201cBasel III Liquidity Framework\u201d) (together, \"Basel III\"). In October 2013, the U.S. banking regulators published a final rule implementing the Basel III Capital Framework and the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s phase-out of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, which we refer to as the \u201cBasel III Final Rule\u201d. The Basel III Final Rule establishes new minimum capital and buffer requirements to be phased in by 2019 and also requires the deduction of certain assets from capital, within prescribed limitations, and the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in capital. The Basel III Final Rule also increases capital requirements for counterparty credit risk and introduces a supplementary leverage ratio that will become a binding, and publicly disclosed, measure starting on January 1, 2018. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA began complying with the effective portions of the Basel III Final Rule on January 1, 2014. The Basel III Final Rule will materially increase our regulatory capital requirements over the next several years. In addition to the Basel III Final Rule, there continue to be numerous proposals that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as HSBC North America. The Basel Committee intends to finalize by the end of 2016 reform initiatives in three areas: (i) enhancements to the risk sensitivity and robustness of the standardized approaches; (ii) review of the role of internal models in the capital framework; and (iii) finalization of the design and calibration of the leverage ratio and capital floors. These reform initiatives include adoption of revisions to the market risk capital framework and proposed consultations on revisions to the standardized approaches for operational risk and credit risk. The Basel Committee has also indicated it intends to finalize its approach to the regulatory treatment of interest rate risk in the banking book to ensure that banks have appropriate capital to cover potential losses from exposures to changes in interest rates. Further revisions to the Basel III capital framework resulting from these initiatives could materially increase our capital requirements to the extent they are implemented by the Federal Reserve.\nFurther increases in regulatory capital may also be required in response to other U.S. supervisory requirements relating to capital. The exact amount, however, will depend upon our prevailing risk profile and that of our North America affiliates under various stress scenarios. Participation by HSBC North America in the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR stress test process will also require that HSBC North America maintain sufficient capital to meet minimum regulatory ratios over a nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon, which could also require increased capital to withstand the application of the stress scenarios over the planning horizon. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it is evaluating how and whether to incorporate applicable buffers into the post-stress minimum requirements that large banking organizations like HSBC North America must maintain in connection with CCAR stress tests and the Federal Reserve's capital plan review. These stress testing requirements will influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process, and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us.\nThe Basel Committee has adopted two minimum liquidity risk measures which are applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America. The LCR measures the amount of a financial institution\u2019s unencumbered, high-quality, liquid assets relative to the net cash outflows the institution could encounter under a significant 30-day stress scenario. The NSFR measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations over a one-year period. The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the LCR with stricter requirements and a faster implementation timeline than the Basel Committee has established. Under the final rules, certain large banking institutions such as HSBC North America began the LCR transition period on January 1, 2015 and are required to be fully\nHSBC Finance Corporation\ncompliant by January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019. HSBC North America has adjusted its liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to change their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future final rules. The U.S. regulators have not yet issued a proposal to implement the NSFR for U.S. banking organizations.\nWe may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that we satisfy requirements relating to our mortgage foreclosure processes. As previously reported, HSBC Finance Corporation, and our indirect parent, HSBC North America, entered into a Servicing Consent Order with the Federal Reserve and our affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, entered into a similar consent order with the OCC following completion of a broad horizontal review of industry foreclosure practices. The Servicing Consent Order requires us to take prescribed actions to address the deficiencies noted in the joint examination and described in the consent order. We continue to work with our regulators to align our processes with the requirements of the Servicing Consent Orders and implement operational changes as required.\nThe Servicing Consent Orders required us to perform an independent review of foreclosures pending or completed between January 2009 and December 2010 to determine if any borrower was financially injured as a result of an error in the foreclosure process. We refer to this as the Independent Foreclosure Review. In February 2013, HSBC Finance Corporation and our indirect parent, HSBC North America, entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve, and our affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, entered into an agreement with the OCC, pursuant to which the Independent Foreclosure Review ceased and HSBC North America made a cash payment of $96 million into a fund used to make payments to borrowers that were in active foreclosure during 2009 and 2010 and, in addition, is providing other assistance (e.g. receivable modifications) to help eligible borrowers. As a result, in 2012, we recorded expenses of $85 million which reflects the portion of HSBC North America's total expense of $104 million that we believe is allocable to us. As of December 31, 2015, Rust Consulting, Inc., the paying agent, has issued virtually all checks to eligible borrowers. See Note 22, \u201cLitigation and Regulatory Matters,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn addition, the Servicing Consent Orders do not preclude additional enforcement actions against HSBC Finance Corporation or our affiliates by bank regulatory, governmental or law enforcement agencies, such as the Department of Justice or state Attorneys General, which could include the imposition of civil money penalties and other sanctions relating to the activities that are the subject of the Servicing Consent Orders. In addition, the settlement related to the Independent Foreclosure Review does not preclude private litigation concerning these practices.\nSeparate from the Servicing Consent Orders and the settlement related to the Independent Foreclosure Review discussed above, in February 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and state Attorneys General of 49 states announced a settlement with the five largest U.S. mortgage servicers with respect to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices. In February 2016, we, HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Mortgage Services Inc. and HSBC North America entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, other federal agencies (\u201cFederal Parties\u201d) and the Attorneys General of 49 states and the District of Columbia (\u201cState Parties\u201d) to resolve civil claims related to past residential mortgage loan origination and servicing practices. The national mortgage settlement, may not, however, completely preclude other enforcement actions by state or federal agencies, regulators or law enforcement agencies related to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices, including, but not limited to, matters relating to the securitization of mortgages for investors, including the imposition of civil money penalties, criminal fines or other sanctions. In addition, these practices have in the past resulted in private litigation and such a settlement would not preclude further private litigation concerning foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices.\nThe number of properties added to REO inventory during 2015 decreased as compared with 2014 as many of the properties in the process of foreclosure were sold as a result of our receivable sales program prior to our taking title as a result of our receivable sales program. Our receivable sales program and to a lesser extent, the continued impact of the extended foreclosure timelines will continue to impact the number of REO properties added to inventory during 2016.\nWhile the housing market in the U.S. continues to recover, the strength of recovery varies by market. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to increased delays in several jurisdictions which will continue to take time to resolve.\nRegulatory review of consumer \"enhancement services products\" may require us to make restitution and pay civil money penalties. Through our legacy Cards and Retail Services business, HSBC Finance Corporation previously offered or participated in the marketing, distribution, or servicing of products, such as identity theft protection and credit monitoring products, that were ancillary to the provision of credit to the consumer (enhancement services products). We ceased the marketing, distribution and servicing of these products by May 2012. The offering and administration of these, and other enhancement services products such as debt protection products, has been the subject of enforcement actions against other institutions by regulators, including the CFPB, the OCC, and the FDIC. These enforcement actions have resulted in orders to pay restitution to customers and the assessment\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nof penalties in substantial amounts. In July 2012, the CFPB issued an industry bulletin regarding its review of marketing practices with respect to credit card add-on products, including debt cancellation, identity theft protection, credit report monitoring, and other enhancement services products. Certain state attorneys general also have filed industry-wide suits under state consumer protection statutes, alleging deceptive marketing practices in connection with the sale of payment protection products and demanding restitution and statutory damages for in-state customers. As discussed in Note 3, \"Discontinued Operations,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have made restitution to certain customers in connection with certain enhancement services products and we continue to cooperate with our regulators in connection with their on-going review. In light of the actions regulators have taken in relation to other credit card issuers regarding their enhancement services products, one or more regulators may order us to pay additional restitution to customers and/or impose civil money penalties or other relief arising from our prior offering and administration of such enhancement services products. In conjunction with this on-going review of our prior offering and administration of such enhancement services products, we increased our accrual by $41 million during 2015. Given this review is on-going, the amount by which we have increased our accrual is an estimate and actual experience may differ from our estimate.\nOur risk management measures may not be successful. The management of risk is an integral part of all our activities. Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities. While we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations, our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks. Risks have the potential to affect the results of our operations or financial condition. Specifically, risk equates to the adverse effect on profitability or financial condition arising from different sources of uncertainty including market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, compliance risk, liquidity and funding risk, litigation risk, reputational risk, strategic risk, security and fraud risk, model risk, pension obligation risk and regulatory risk. To manage risk, we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types. The framework fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions. It also strives to ensure that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities. While our risk management framework employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, such techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every unfavorable event or the specifics and timing of every outcome. Failure to manage risks appropriately could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe delivery of our regulatory priorities is subject to execution risk. The financial services industry is currently facing an unprecedented period of scrutiny. Additionally, we are subject to a number of consent orders with our regulators. Regulatory requests, legal matters and business initiatives all require a significant amount of time and resources to implement. The magnitude and complexity of projects required to meet these demands has resulted in heightened execution risk. Organizational change and external factors, including the challenging macroeconomic environment and the extent and pace of regulatory change also contribute to execution risk. These factors could adversely affect the successful delivery of our regulatory priorities.\nOperational risks are inherent in our businesses and may adversely impact our business and reputation. We are exposed to many types of operational risks that are inherent in banking operations, including fraudulent and other criminal activities (both internal and external), breakdowns in processes or procedures and systems failure or non-availability. These risks apply equally when we rely on outside suppliers or vendors to provide services to us and our customers. These operational risks could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Further, there is a risk that our operating system controls as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as exposing us to litigation or losses not covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to disruption from the external environment. We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems infrastructure arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include:\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses, electrical, telecommunications, or other essential utility outages;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes or other severe weather conditions and earthquakes;\n\u2022\nevents arising from local, regional or international politics, including terrorist acts; or\n\u2022\nabsence of operating systems personnel due to global pandemics or otherwise, which could have a significant effect on our business operations as well as on HSBC affiliates world-wide.\nSuch disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers, an inability to collect our receivables in affected areas and other loss or liability to us.\nWe may suffer losses due to employee negligence, fraud or misconduct. Non-compliance with policies, employee misconduct, negligence and fraud could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. We are dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if an employee or employees, acting alone or in concert with non-affiliated\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nthird parties, causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. In recent years, a number of multinational financial institutions have suffered material losses due to the actions of \u2018rogue traders\u2019 or other employees. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not always be effective. Employee misconduct could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may suffer losses due to negligence, fraud or misconduct by third parties. We depend on third party suppliers, outsource providers and our affiliates for a variety of services. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including risks relating to break-downs or failures of such parties\u2019 own systems or employees. The Federal Reserve requires financial institutions to maintain a service provider risk management program, which includes due diligence requirements for service providers as well as for our affiliates who may perform services for us. Under Federal Reserve guidance \u201cservice providers\u201d is broadly defined to include all entities that have entered into a contractual relationship with a financial institution to provide business functions or activities. If our service provider risk management and due diligence program is not sufficiently robust, this could lead to regulatory intervention. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, and may result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage or regulatory intervention, all of which may materially adversely affect us.\nA failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, and may adversely impact our businesses and reputation. Data quality and integrity are critical for our decision making, enterprise risk management and operational processes, as well as for complying with applicable regulations. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process a large number of complex transactions, most of which involve, in some fashion, electronic devices or electronic networks. If any of our financial, accounting, data processing or other recordkeeping systems and management controls fail, or are subject to cyberattack that could compromise integrity, availability or confidentiality of our systems or data, we could be materially adversely affected.\nIn recent years, distributed denial of service (\"DDoS\") attacks, spearphishing campaigns, advanced malware, social engineering and insider threats have grown in volume and level of sophistication each with the intent to obtain personal customer financial or proprietary corporate information. Such acts can affect our business by:\n\u2022\ncompromising the confidentiality or integrity of our customers' data, potentially impacting our customers' ability to repay loan balances and negatively impacting their credit ratings;\n\u2022\nputting our customers at risk for identity theft, account takeover and credit abuse;\n\u2022\ncausing us to incur remediation and other costs related to liability to customers or third parties for losses, repairs to remedy systems flaws, or incentives to customers and business partners to maintain and rebuild business relationships after the attack;\n\u2022\nincreasing our costs to respond to such threats and to enhance our processes and systems to ensure maximum security of data;\n\u2022\ndamaging our reputation as a result of public disclosure of a breach of our systems or a loss of data event;\n\u2022\nresulting in unauthorized disclosure or alteration of our corporate confidential information and confidential information of employees, customers and counterparties;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our customers' or third parties' business operations; and\n\u2022\nresulting in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.\nThe threat from cyberattacks, on us and on third party vendors on which we rely, is a concern for our organization and failure to protect our operations from internet crime or cyberattacks may result in financial loss and loss of customer data or other sensitive information which could undermine our reputation and our ability to attract and keep customers. We face various cyber risks in line with other multinational financial organizations.\nWe and other multinational financial organizations have been, and will continue to be subject to an increasing risk of cyber incidents from these activities due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the Internet and customers use of personal smartphones, PCs and other computing devices, tablet PCs and other mobile devices to access products and services to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime for seeking financial gain, hacktivists (geopolitical designated groups), cyberterrorists (attacks against critical infrastructure) and state sponsored advanced persistent threats, sometimes referred to as APTs, for corporate espionage. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, HSBC Group\u2019s prominent size and scale and role in the financial services industry, and our offering of Internet banking and mobile banking platforms that seek to serve our customers when and how they want to be served. In\nHSBC Finance Corporation\naddition, the consolidation of clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and increased interconnectivity of financial institutions with such central agents, exchanges and clearing houses increases the exposure of cyberattacks on critical parties which may affect us. Evaluating and monitoring the cyberthreat landscape in comparison to our existing capabilities, and adjusting our programs in order to respond to these threats, may require additional capital expenses for human resources and technology.\nOn October 8, 2015 a brief DDoS attack was directed towards multiple web services hosted in the United States. As a result, there was some impact to certain HSBC websites and brief service disruptions reported. The attack was successfully mitigated via internal and external vendor controls in multiple datacenters. On March 4, 2015, certain HSBC staff and customer documents were discovered on the Internet. Investigations traced the source of the documents back to a former HSBC employee, who had resigned from HSBC U.S. in December 2008. Specifically, the data was traced to the former employee\u2019s personal portable storage device. The OCC and Federal Reserve, as well as 18 state agencies were informed of the data breach of approximately 86,000 customer records. HSBC offered one year of credit monitoring to those affected customers. HSBC successfully contacted the former employee and retrieved the device containing HSBC data. No criminal or civil actions were taken. There have been no reports of fraudulent activity as a result of this incident.\nOur businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security (including cyber security) from time to time.\nFailure to successfully change our operational practices may have a material impact on our businesses. Changes to operational practices from time to time could materially impact our performance and results. Such changes may include:\n\u2022\nour determining to further expand our sale of residential mortgage receivables;\n\u2022\nchanges to our charge-off policies or customer account management and risk management/collection policies and practices;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain key employees;\n\u2022\nour investment choices in technology, business infrastructure and specialized personnel; or\n\u2022\nour outsourcing of various operations.\nFurther, in order to react quickly to or meet newly-implemented regulatory requirements, we may need to change or enhance systems within very tight time frames, which would increase operational risk. Failure to implement changes to our operational practices successfully and efficiently may diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses and could result in reputational damage and regulatory intervention, all of which could materially adversely affect us.\nOur financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual report on Form 10-K, the existence of any \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in our internal control over financial reporting. In a company as large and complex as ours, lapses or deficiencies, including significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and we cannot assure you that we will not find one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given future year.\nUncertainty in the U.S. economy and fluctuations in the U.S. markets could negatively impact our business operations. During 2015, delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent were impacted by the expansion of our receivable sales program during the second quarter of 2015 which resulted in a large transfer of receivables to held for sale. Delinquency on accounts less than 180 days contractually delinquent were also positively impacted by lower receivable levels due to receivable run-off and the continued improvements in economic conditions. We cannot anticipate to what extent the trend for improvements in delinquency may continue into 2016, as our performance in 2016 is largely dependent upon macro-economic conditions which include, among other things, housing market conditions, property evaluations, employment levels, interest rates and continued economic recovery, all of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 or any prior periods should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nReceivables held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. The estimated fair value of our receivables held for sale is determined by developing an approximate range of value from a mix of various sources and inputs appropriate for the respective pools of assets aggregated by similar risk characteristics. These sources include recently observed over-the-counter transactions where available, fair value estimates obtained from an HSBC affiliate and a third party valuation specialist for distinct pools of receivables. These fair value estimates are based on discounted cash flow models using assumptions believed to be consistent with those that would be used by market participants in valuing such receivables and trading inputs from other market participants which includes observed primary and secondary trades. Valuation inputs include estimates of future interest rates, prepayment speeds, default and loss curves, estimated collateral values where appropriate (including expenses to be incurred to maintain the collateral) and market discount rates reflecting management's estimate of the rate of return that would be required by\nHSBC Finance Corporation\ninvestors in the current market given the specific characteristics and inherent credit risk of the receivables held for sale. Some of the inputs are influenced by collateral value changes and unemployment rates. Changes in inputs, including the rate of return that investors would require to purchase assets with the same characteristics and of the same credit quality and fluctuations in home price values, could significantly change the carrying amount of the receivables held for sale and related fair value adjustment recognized in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Accordingly, the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments recorded during 2015 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nWe determine the fair value of the fixed rate debt accounted for under fair value option through the use of a third party pricing service. The pricing service sources fair value from quoted market prices and, if not available, expected cash flows are discounted using the appropriate interest rate for the applicable duration of the instrument adjusted for our own credit spread. Such fair value represents the full market price (including credit and interest rate impacts) based on observable market data for the same or similar debt instruments. Net income volatility, whether based on changes in the interest rate or credit risk components of the mark-to-market on debt designated at fair value and the related derivatives, impacts the comparability of our reported results between periods. Accordingly, gain (loss) on debt designated at fair value and related derivatives for 2015 should not be considered indicative of the results for any future periods.\nFederal Reserve policies can significantly affect business and economic conditions and, as a result, our financial results and condition. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for investing and the return we earn on our receivables and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. They also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities. Its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict.\nOur reputation may have a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations. Our ability to conduct business transactions with our counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation, or the reputation of affiliates operating under the HSBC brand, is damaged. Our failure to address, or to appear to fail to address, various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to us and our business prospects. Reputational issues include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nnegative news about us, HSBC, our affiliates or the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022\nalleged irregularities in servicing, foreclosure, consumer collections, mortgage lending practices and receivable modifications;\n\u2022\nalleged deceptive or unfair lending or servicing practices;\n\u2022\nfraud and misappropriation of assets;\n\u2022\nprivacy and data security intrusions related to our customers or employees;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity issues and cyber incidents, whether actual, threatened, or perceived;\n\u2022\ncustomer service;\n\u2022\nactions of a vendor or other third party, including a subcontractor, with whom we do business;\n\u2022\nethical issues, including potential conflicts of interest and the acceptance or receipt of gifts and entertainment; and\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory requirements.\nThe failure to address, or the perception that we have failed to address, any of these issues appropriately could make it difficult for us to conduct business transactions with our counterparties or give rise to increased regulatory action, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to meet funding requirements due to our balance sheet attrition could impact operations. Adequate liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses. The pace of our balance sheet attrition has a significant impact on our liquidity and risk management processes. Properly managing these processes is critical to mitigating liquidity risk. Lower cash flow resulting from declining receivable balances as well as lower cash generated from balance sheet attrition will not provide sufficient cash to fully cover maturing debt in future periods. A portion of the required funding could be generated through planned sales of certain real estate secured receivables. A portion of any funding gap could be borrowed from one or more of our affiliates. We anticipate all future term funding will be provided by HSBC affiliates.\nIn December 2012, HSBC, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA entered into agreements with U.S. and U.K. government agencies regarding past inadequate compliance with anti-money laundering (\"AML\"), Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\") and sanctions laws. Among those agreements, HSBC and HSBC Bank USA entered into the five-year U.S. deferred prosecution agreement with\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of West Virginia (the \"U.S. DPA\").\nUnder the terms of the U.S. DPA, upon notice and opportunity to be heard, the DOJ has sole discretion to determine whether HSBC or HSBC Bank USA has breached the U.S. DPA, including if they have committed any crime under U.S. federal law subsequent to the signing of the U.S. DPA. In the event of the prosecution of criminal charges, there could be significant collateral consequences to HSBC and its affiliates, including HSBC Finance Corporation, including potential restrictions on the ability of HSBC Bank USA to operate in the U.S., loss of business, revocation of licenses, withdrawal of funding and harm to our reputation, which may mean that our affiliate may not be able to provide funding to fill any funding gaps we may have, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdverse changes in the credit ratings of our affiliates could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. The credit ratings of our affiliates, which are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, are an important part of maintaining our liquidity. As discussed in previous filings, we do not currently expect to need to raise funds from the issuance of third party, long-term debt going forward, but instead any required funding has been integrated into HSBC North America's funding plans which we expect to be sourced through HSBC USA or through direct support from HSBC or its affiliates. To the extent future funding is to be provided by HSBC affiliates, the credit ratings of those affiliates will affect their borrowing costs and, as a result, the cost of funding to us. There can be no assurance that downgrades of the ratings of our affiliates will not occur. If such downgrades occur, there can be no assurance that our affiliates will have access to the funds needed to fund our liquidity requirements as needed.\nWe may not be able to continue to wind down our real estate secured receivable portfolio at an accelerated rate. Our real estate secured receivable portfolio held for investment is currently running off. The timeframe in which this portfolio will liquidate is dependent upon the rate at which receivables pay off or charge-off prior to their maturity, which fluctuates for a variety of reasons such as interest rates, availability of refinancing, home values and individual borrowers' liquidity profile, all of which are outside our control. In light of the current economic conditions and mortgage industry trends described above, our receivable prepayment rates have slowed when compared with historical experience even though interest rates remain low. Additionally, our receivable modification programs, which are primarily designed to improve cash collections and avoid foreclosure as determined to be appropriate, are contributing to the slower receivable prepayment rates. While difficult to project both receivable prepayment rates and default rates, based on current experience we expect our run-off real estate secured receivable portfolio (excluding receivables held for sale) to be approximately $6 billion by the end of 2017. We expect run-off to continue to be slow as the remaining real estate secured receivables held for investment stay on the balance sheet longer due to the lack of refinancing alternatives as well as the impact of a continued elongated foreclosure process. The size of this portfolio and run-off rate is also affected by foreclosures. Upon completion of the foreclosure process, the underlying properties acquired in satisfaction of the receivables are classified as REO and sold separately. Certain courts and state legislatures have issued rules or statutes relating to foreclosures and scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to increased delays in several jurisdictions which will continue to take time to resolve.\nWe intend to wind down this portfolio as quickly as practicable in a responsible and economically rational manner, considering market pricing as well as other factors. In addition, and as discussed in prior filings, we plan to continue to sell certain real estate secured receivables. During the second quarter of 2013, we established an on-going receivable sales program under which we transfer to receivables held for sale first lien real estate secured receivables held for investment when a receivable meeting pre-determined criteria is written down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell in accordance with our existing charge-off policies (generally 180 days past due). During the second quarter of 2015 we expanded our receivable sales program to also transfer to held for sale substantially all of our first lien real estate secured receivables held for investment which have been either re-aged, modified or became subject to a bankruptcy filing since 2007, along with any second lien balances associated with these receivables. This resulted in the transfer of receivables in the second quarter of 2015 with a carrying value of $11,399 million, including accrued interest, to receivables held for sale as we no longer had the intent to hold these receivables. Under our expanded receivable sales program, we continue to transfer substantially all real estate secured receivables to held for sale when either of the above criteria are met. We expect that receivables held for sale at December 31, 2015 will be sold in multiple transactions through 2017, although the actual time to complete these sales and ultimate earnings impact depend on many factors including market conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the receivables transferred to held for sale in a timely manner or at favorable prices.\nWhile we made substantial progress towards winding down this portfolio in recent years, we may not be able to liquidate or dispose of these portfolios at the same level or pace as in recent years or execute the planned sales within expected timeframes. As a result, our ability to continue to reduce our risk-weighted assets or reduce related expenses may be adversely affected depending on the ultimate pace or level at which these portfolios are liquidated and sold. We may be called upon by HSBC North America or HSBC to execute certain other actions or strategies to ensure HSBC North America and HSBC each meets its capital requirements.\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nPerformance of modified receivables in the current economic conditions may prove less predictable and result in higher losses. In an effort to provide assistance to our customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, in recent years we have modified the terms of a number of our receivables. While we have a long-standing history of working with customers experiencing financial difficulties, the number of customers that have needed and qualified for receivable modifications in recent years was significantly higher than in our prior historical experience. Under the current economic conditions, the credit performance of these modified receivables may not conform to either historical experience or our expectations. In addition, deterioration in housing prices and unemployment could negatively impact the performance of the modified portfolio. While our credit loss reserve process considers whether receivables have been re-aged or are subject to modification, loss reserve estimates are influenced by factors outside our control, such as consumer payment patterns and economic conditions, making it reasonably possible that loss reserve estimates could change in either direction.\nA significant rise in interest rates may significantly impact our net interest income which may adversely impact our financial results. Both our Consumer Lending and Mortgage Services\u2019 real estate secured receivable portfolios are expected to continue to remain on our balance sheet for extended durations. Reduced mortgage prepayment rates and higher levels of receivable modifications have had the effect of extending the projected average life of these receivable portfolios. As a result, both net interest income at risk and asset portfolio valuations have increasingly become exposed to rising interest rates as the average life of our liability portfolios has declined while the average life of our asset portfolios has extended. In the event interest rates rise significantly and we are not successful in fully mitigating such rise or otherwise changing the average lives of our liability and asset portfolios, net interest income, and consequently, net income or loss, may be negatively affected. A significant rise in interest rates could also result in slower repayment rates on performing receivables. As discussed above, we expect that receivables held for sale at December 31, 2015 will be sold in multiple transactions through 2017, although the actual time to complete these sales and ultimate earnings impact depend on many factors, including future market conditions. Additionally, we may be called upon by HSBC North America or HSBC to execute certain other actions or strategies to ensure HSBC North America and HSBC each meets its capital requirements.\nSignificant reductions in pension assets may require additional financial contributions from us. Effective January 1, 2005, our previously separate qualified defined benefit pension plan was combined with that of HSBC Bank USA\u2019s into a single HSBC North America qualified defined benefit plan. As of January 1, 2013, all future contributions under the Cash Balance formula ceased, thereby eliminating future benefit accruals. At December 31, 2015, plan assets were lower than projected plan liabilities resulting in an under-funded status. The accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $475 million. As these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of this deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up this shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 16, \u201cPension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan.\nLawsuits and regulatory investigations and proceedings may continue and increase in the current economic and regulatory environment. In the ordinary course of business, HSBC Finance Corporation and our affiliates are routinely named as defendants in, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current and/or former operations and are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and formal and informal proceedings, as described in Note 22, \u201cLitigation and Regulatory Matters,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, remediation payments, fines, penalties, injunctions and other relief. There is no certainty that the litigation will decrease in the near future, especially in the event of continued unemployment rates, a resurgent recession or additional regulatory and law enforcement investigations and proceedings by federal and state governmental agencies. Further, in the current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the financial services industry, there may be additional regulatory investigations and reviews conducted by banking and other financial regulators, state Attorneys General or state regulatory and law enforcement agencies that, if determined adversely, may result in judgments, settlements, remediation payments, fines, penalties or other results, including additional compliance requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause us serious reputational harm. See \u201cWe may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that we satisfy requirements relating to our mortgage foreclosure processes and the industry-wide delay in processing foreclosures may have a significant impact upon loss severity\u201d above.\nWe establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. It is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of many of the legal, regulatory and other adversarial proceedings involving our business, particularly those cases in which matters are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, those which seek unspecified damages or those which involve novel legal claims. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nHSBC Finance Corporation\nManagement projections, estimates and judgments based on historical performance may not be indicative of our future performance. Our management is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations and, in particular, credit loss reserve estimates are subject to management\u2019s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control. Judgment remains a more significant factor in the estimation of inherent probable losses in our receivable portfolios, including second lien receivables with first lien mortgages that we do not own or service. To the extent historical averages of the progression of receivables into stages of delinquency or the amount of loss realized upon charge-off are not predictive of future losses and management is unable to accurately evaluate the portfolio risk factors not fully reflected in historical models, unexpected additional losses could result.\nWe are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income and shareholders\u2019 equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans, future capital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income, future corporate tax rates, and the application of inherently complex tax laws. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Note 12, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our deferred tax assets.\nChanges in accounting standards are beyond our control and may have a material impact on how we report our financial results and condition. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the IASB, the SEC and HSBC North America\u2019s bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve, change the financial accounting and reporting standards, or the interpretation thereof, and guidance that govern the preparation and disclosure of external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report and disclose our financial results and condition, including our segment results. For example, the FASB's financial instruments project will likely, among other things, significantly change how we measure credit impairment on our receivables portfolio, which could also affect the level of deferred tax assets that we recognize. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating of prior period financial statements in material amounts. We may, in certain instances, change a business practice in order to comply with new or revised standards.\nOur interpretation or application of the tax laws to which we are subject could differ from those of the relevant governmental authorities, which could result in the payment of additional taxes and penalties. We are subject to the various tax laws of the U.S. and its states and municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are inherently complex and we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws to our entities, operations and businesses. Our interpretations and application of the tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority, which could result in the potential for the payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest, which could be material.\nKey employees may be difficult to attract or retain due to contraction of the business and limits on promotional activities. Our employees are our most important resource and, in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. Employee fatigue, hiring and salary freezes and external competition targeting top talent have impacts on attrition. If we were unable to continue to attract, develop and retain qualified key employees to support the various functions of our businesses, our performance could be materially adversely affected. Our recent financial performance, expense reduction initiatives, and reductions in variable compensation and other benefits and the fact that our remaining business is in wind-down could raise concerns about key employees' future compensation and opportunities. As economic conditions continue to improve, we may face increased difficulty in retaining top performers and critical skilled employees. If key personnel were to leave us and equally knowledgeable or skilled personnel are unavailable within HSBC or could not be sourced in the market, our ability to manage our business and implement the strategic initiatives currently underway may be hindered or impaired.", "PERMNO": 20124, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "HBC1"}
