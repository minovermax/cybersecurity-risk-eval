{"cik": "1697500", "company": "Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Many of these risks are beyond our control. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the events described below were to actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and our results could differ materially from expected and historical results, any of which may also adversely affect the holders of our stock.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Industry:\nThe volatility of oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the demand for our systems, products and services, and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe demand for our products and services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related levels of capital spending and drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. The COVID-19 pandemic, combined with a period of increased production from major oil producing nations and decreasing availability of crude oil storage, contributed to lower commodity prices compared to historical levels, both of which are expected to continue to impact demand over the short-to-medium term. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease or remain stagnant) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells. As a result, demand for proppants or chemicals may decrease, which could, in turn, lead to lower demand for our products and services and may cause lower prices and lower utilization of our assets. We have, and may in the future, experienced significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices.\nEvents outside of our control, including a pandemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, political unrest and economic recessions occurring around the globe, could materially adversely affect our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks that are outside of our control which could significantly disrupt the demand for oil and natural gas and our products and services, and adversely impact our operations and financial condition. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the extent to which it has caused business disruptions, disrupted the oil and gas industry and global supply chains, negatively impacted the global economy, reduced global demand for oil and gas and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets;\n\u25cf the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries, including continued hostilities in the Middle East; or\n\u25cf domestic civil unrest, including: recent acts of protest and civil unrest related to the 2020 presidential election, political instability and societal disruption, or damage to infrastructure or our customers\u2019 operations.\nThe degree to which events outside of our control adversely impacts our results will also depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the development, availability and administration of effective treatments and vaccines and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and any subsequent recovery of normal economic and operating conditions.\nThese factors collectively have contributed to unprecedented negative global economic impacts, including a significant decrease in demand, and which such impacts may continue into the future. While we expect these matters\ndiscussed above will continue to disrupt our operations in some way, the degree of the adverse financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nWe face significant competition that may impede our ability to gain market share or cause us to lose market share, or that could make adoption of new product offerings or services difficult.\nThe market for supply chain management and well site logistic services is becoming increasingly competitive. We face competition from proppant producers, pressure pumping companies, transloaders and proppant transporters who also offer solutions for unloading, storing and delivering proppant at well sites and also from competitors who, like us, are focused on developing more efficient last mile logistics management solutions. Some of these solutions utilize containers for on-site proppant storage and handling delivery, while others use silo-based storage as we do. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and may develop technology superior to ours or more cost-effective than ours. Competition in our industry and for our products is thus based on price, consistency and quality of products, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering and technical support. If our competitors are able to respond to industry conditions or trends more rapidly or effectively or resort to price competition, or if we are unable to gain market acceptance of new product offerings, we may be unable to gain or maintain our market share or may lose market share or operating profit, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSilica-related legislation, including compliance with OSHA regulations relating to respirable crystalline silica, or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. For example, OSHA has implemented rules establishing a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica and provided other provisions to protect employees. These rules require compliance with engineering control obligations to limit exposures to respirable crystalline silica in connection with hydraulic fracturing activities by June 2021. If we are unable to satisfy these obligations, or are not able to do so in a manner that is cost effective or attractive to our customers, our business operations may be adversely affected or availability or demand for our products could be significantly affected. Federal and state regulatory authorities, including OSHA, and analogous state agencies may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations relating to exposure to crystalline silica that are adopted, or that the costs of complying with such future laws and regulations would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify or cease our operations.\nIn addition, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with health risks, including the lung disease silicosis. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the hydraulic fracturing industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of hydraulic fracture sand, may have the effect of discouraging our customers' use of hydraulic fracture sand. The actual or perceived health risks of handling hydraulic fracture sand could materially and adversely affect hydraulic fracturing service providers, including us, through reduced use of hydraulic fracture sand, the threat of product liability or the filing of lawsuits naming us as a defendant, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers or reduced financing sources available to the hydraulic fracturing industry. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations\u201d for more discussion on occupational health and safety matters.\nChanges in the transportation industry, including fluctuations in transportation costs, changes in the way in which proppant or chemicals are transported to the well site or the availability or reliability of transportation to supply our proppant or chemical management systems and transloading services, could impair the ability of our customers to take delivery of proppant or chemicals or make our products and services less attractive and thereby adversely impact our business.\nThe transportation industry is subject to possible legislative and regulatory changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Disruption of transportation services due to factors outside of our\ncontrol, including shortages of rail cars or trucks, extreme weather-related events, accidents, strikes, lockouts, increased regulation, more stringent railcar or safety regulatory initiatives, or other events could temporarily impair the ability of our customers to take delivery of our systems and proppant or chemicals at the well site or affect the provision of last mile services. Accordingly, if there are disruptions of the services utilized by our customers (whether these services are provided by us or a third party), and they are unable to find alternative transportation providers, our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, alternative transportation methods for transporting and delivering proppant or chemicals to the well site could make our product offerings less attractive than those of our competitors and affect our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to inherent risks some of which are beyond our control. These risks may be self-insured or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur assets and operations may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events such as extreme weather events that may disrupt our business, including manufacturing and field operations. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension or cancellation of operations. In addition, our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters.\nWe do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks and we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nReliance upon a few large customers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nIt is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future and the operations of our customers have and may continue to experience delays or disruptions and temporary suspensions of operations. We typically do not enter into long-term contractual agreements with our customers and if we were to lose any material customer, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels or within a short period of time and such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization or pricing levels.\nWe may grow through acquisitions and our failure to properly plan and manage those acquisitions may adversely affect our performance.\nWe have completed and may, in the future, pursue asset acquisitions or acquisitions of businesses. We must plan and manage any acquisitions and integrations effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. If we fail to manage acquisitions and integrations effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSeasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.\nOur operations are located in different regions of the United States, some of which are prone to periods of heavy snow, ice or rain and others of which may be prone to certain natural disasters such as tornadoes or prolonged periods of drought. The occurrence of any such severe weather conditions or natural disasters could cause our E&P customers to suspend operations, thereby reducing the demand for our systems and services and our ability to generate revenues.\nWe engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe have entered into transactions with related parties. The details of certain of these transactions are set forth in Note 13. \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d under Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management or directors. Such a\nconflict could cause an individual in our management or on our board of directors to seek to advance his or her economic interests above ours. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. Our board of directors, or a committee thereof, regularly reviews these transactions. Notwithstanding this, it is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights, or any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, could result in a loss in our competitive advantage or market share.\nBecause of the technical nature of our business, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on third-party intellectual property licenses in connection with our business. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future or they may be invalidated. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents or other proprietary rights, third parties may challenge patents or proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. It is possible that our competitors or others could independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available. Alternatively, third parties may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates intellectual property rights and we may be required to obtain necessary licenses or substantially re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our existing intellectual property rights or any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive advantage and result in us being enjoined from using or offering such products or technology and cause us to incur significant expenses.\nTechnological advancements in well service products and technologies, including those that reduce the amount of proppant or chemicals required for hydraulic fracturing operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies, or technologies comparable to ours, in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which may allow them to gain technological advantages or implement new technologies more rapidly than us. Limits on our ability to effectively use, implement or adapt to new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to interruptions or failures in our information technology systems.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including but not limited to our Solaris Lens\u00ae inventory management systems. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other security breaches, or similar events. The failure of any of our information technology systems may cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 operations, which could adversely affect our reputation, sales and profitability.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital and information technologies to deliver our systems and perform many of our services and to process and record financial and operating data and in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business\noperations. This could result in significant losses, loss of customers and business opportunities, reputation damage, litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our systems and controls for protecting against cyber security risks, and those used by our business partners, may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. In addition, any technology required for any mandate by authorities requiring the transition to remote work increases our vulnerability to cybersecurity threats, including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems. Any material disruption in our information technology systems or systems that affect our business operations, delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems, or any vulnerabilities rending data or systems unusable following any mandated remote work situations, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business.\nIncreasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer use of substitutes to energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our customers\u2019 hydrocarbon products and our services, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our customers\u2019 hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against those customers.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us or our customers and to the diversion of investment to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and/or our access to and costs of capital.\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services, whether permanently or temporarily could adversely affect our business. We do not have any written employment agreements with our executives at this time. Further, we do not maintain \"key person\" life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nIf we are unable to access the services of a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers, or are required to significantly increase wages to attract or retain such workers, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nThe manufacture and delivery of our products and performance of our services requires skilled and qualified workers with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility of the oilfield services industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive. Increased competition for their services could result in a loss of available, skilled workers or at a price that is not as advantageous to our business, both of which could negatively affect our operating results. Though our historical turnover rates have been significantly lower than those of our competitors, if we are unable to retain or meet growing demand for skilled technical personnel, our operating results and our ability to execute our growth strategies may be adversely affected.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance may negatively affect our customer relationships and, to the extent we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, adversely impact our revenues.\nOur ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and permits, which legal requirements are subject to change. Multiple or particularly severe accidents and high employee turnover, can contribute to a deterioration of our safety record. If one or more accidents were to occur in\nconnection with the use of our systems or performance of our services, the affected customer may seek to terminate or cancel its use of our services which could cause us to lose substantial revenues. Furthermore, our ability to attract new customers may be impaired if they elect not to engage us because they view our safety record as unacceptable.\nRisks Related to Financial Condition:\nOur business depends on domestic capital spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and reductions in capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is directly affected by capital spending to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. The oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns in activity. If oil and natural gas prices decline below current levels for an extended period of time, certain of our customers may be unable to pay their vendors and service providers, including us, as a result of the decline in commodity prices. Reduced activity in our areas of operation as a result of decreased capital spending may also have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results. If the recent recovery does not continue or our customers fail to further increase their capital spending, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u25cf expected economic returns to E&P companies of new well completions;\n\u25cf domestic and foreign economic conditions and supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production, and inventories;\n\u25cf the supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing and equipment in the United States, including the supply and demand for lower emissions hydraulic fracturing equipment;\n\u25cf federal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and exploration and production activities;\n\u25cf United States federal, tribal, state and local and non-United States governmental laws, regulations and taxes, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf changes in the transportation industry that services our business, including the price and availability of transportation;\n\u25cf political and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u25cf the current supply and demand imbalance for crude oil and actions by the members of OPEC with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels, including the failure of such countries to comply with supply limitation and production cuts;\n\u25cf global or national health concerns including health epidemics such as the outbreak of COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020;\n\u25cf political or civil unrest in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf worldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u25cf stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf advances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption; and\n\u25cf the potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels.\nWe may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets or the deterioration of the financial condition, and resulting credit risk, of our customers.\nOur future results may be impacted by the uncertainty caused by an economic downturn, weak economic conditions and widespread financial distress, volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business resulting in a reduction in our customers' spending and their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to us, such as the\nfailure of customers to honor their commitments or the failure of major suppliers to complete orders. Additionally, during times when the natural gas or crude oil markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience financial difficulties, including being unable to access debt or equity financing, which could result in a reduction in our customers' spending for our systems and services. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we are unable to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting bankruptcy or increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use our equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nOur 2019 Credit Agreement subjects us to various financial and other restrictive covenants. These restrictions may limit our operational or financial flexibility and could subject us to potential defaults under our 2019 Credit Agreement.\nOur 2019 Credit Agreement subjects us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on incurring additional debt and certain distributions. Our 2019 Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including a certain leverage ratio and a certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratio we must maintain. Please see Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Debt Agreements.\" Our ability to comply with these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial covenants of our 2019 Credit Agreement, then amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become due immediately or we may be unable to access the funds available. Any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryovers may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $203.9 million of federal net operating loss carryovers and $58.0 million of state net operating loss carryovers. $138.1 million of such federal net operating loss carryovers have no expiration date and the remaining federal net operating loss carryovers expire in 2037. State net operating loss carryovers will expire in varying amounts beginning in 2037. Utilization of our NOLs depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an \u201cownership change\u201d (as determined under Section 382 of the Code). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of the relevant corporation\u2019s stock change their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, utilization of the NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code, determined by multiplying the value of the relevant corporation\u2019s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in Section 382 of the Code, and potentially increased for certain gains recognized within five years after the ownership change if we have a net built-in gain in our assets at the time of the ownership change. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until they expire. As a result, some or all of our U.S. federal, state or foreign NOLs could expire before they can be used. In addition, future ownership changes or changes to the U.S. tax laws could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset our future income with our NOLs, this would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows if we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nLaws, regulations, executive orders and other regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could increase our and our customers costs of doing business and result in restrictions, delays or cancellations that may serve to limit future oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing, our operational services support our E&P customers in such activities. The practice continues to be controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation of the hydraulic fracturing process, including by federal and state agencies and local municipalities. Additionally, with concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced wastewaters into\nunderground disposal wells, certain regulators are also considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. Our customers' inability to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could also adversely impact their exploration and production operations and result in a corresponding reduction in demand for our services. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations\u201d for more discussion on these hydraulic fracturing, seismicity and water availability matters. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or issuance of executive orders regarding hydraulic fracturing, seismic activities, or leasing activities on federal properties, or the inability of our customers to maintain adequate water supplies could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our services and increased compliance costs and time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing worker health and safety, protection of the environment, including natural resources, and the management, transportation and disposal of wastes and other materials. In addition, our business activities present risks of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities, including costs and liabilities resulting from our management, transportation and disposal of regulated materials, such as oilfield and other wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and due to historical oilfield industry operations and waste disposal practices. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations\u201d for more discussion on these matters.\nCompliance with these regulations and other regulatory initiatives, or any other new environmental laws, regulations and executive actions could impact our customers, increase the costs associated with our business or reduce demand for our services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuel conservation measures could reduce demand for oil and natural gas which would in turn reduce the demand for our systems and services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons and therefore for our systems and services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.\nOur and our customers' operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change, including regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks, which could result in increased operating and capital costs for our customers and reduced demand for the products and services we provide.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs as well as to eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our E&P customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations\u201d for more discussion on the threat of climate and restriction of GHG emissions. The adoption and implementation of any international, federal, regional or state legislation, executive actions, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards that restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased compliance costs or costs of consuming fossil fuels, which could reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and other laws intended to protect certain species of wildlife govern our and our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers\u2019 operations, which constraints could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our customers\u2019 ability to develop new oil and natural gas wells.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act and comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations\u201d. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could indirectly cause our customers to incur additional costs, cause our or our oil and natural gas E&P customers\u2019 operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas, which could reduce demand for our products and services to those customers.\nAnti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party's indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the use and operation of our systems and services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming have enacted statutes generally referred to as \"oilfield anti-indemnity acts\" expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party's indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nSolaris Inc. is a holding company. Solaris Inc.\u2019s sole material asset is its equity interest in Solaris LLC and Solaris Inc. is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Solaris LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and cover its corporate and other overhead expenses.\nSolaris Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its equity interest in Solaris LLC. Solaris Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent that Solaris Inc. needs funds, including making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and Solaris LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions or payments under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of the 2019 Credit Agreement or any future financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, Solaris Inc.\u2019s liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur stock price could be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of your Class A common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors outside of our control, including public reaction to our releases and filings, actions by our competitors and actions by our stockholders. Additionally, if our results fail to meet analyst expectations or if analysts cease coverage of our Company, fail to publish reports on us regularly, or downgrade our Class A common stock, our stock price or trading volume could decline. Volatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your Class A common stock at or above the price at which you purchased the stock. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company's securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management's attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of our Class A common stock in subsequent offerings. In addition, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Original Investors may redeem their Solaris LLC Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock (on a one-for-one basis, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions) and then sell those shares of Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock.\nHolders of our Class A common stock may not receive dividends on our Class A common stock.\nWe declared our first dividend to Class A stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2018 and have continued to declare dividends on a quarterly basis. See Part II, Item 5. \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d of this Annual Report. We are not required to declare future dividends and holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any determination to pay dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property by us in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including business conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital requirements, contractual restrictions including restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements and other factors.\nOur principal stockholders collectively hold a significant amount of the voting power of our common stock.\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our certificate of incorporation, and the members of Solaris LLC immediately prior to the IPO (collectively, the \u201cOriginal Investors\u201d) own a substantial majority of our Class B common stock, which represents approximately 35% of our combined economic interest and voting power.\nAlthough the Original Investors are entitled to act separately in their own respective interests with respect to their ownership in us, if the Original Investors choose to act in concert, they will together have the ability to strongly influence the election of the members of our board of directors, and thereby our management and affairs. In addition, they will be able to strongly influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions. The existence of significant stockholders may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder.\nCertain Designated Parties are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable such Designated Parties and their respective affiliates to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur governing documents provide that Yorktown, Wells Fargo Central Pacific Holdings, Inc. and our directors who are not also our officers, including William A. Zartler, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our board of directors, and their respective portfolio investments and affiliates (collectively, the \"Designated Parties\") are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.\nIn particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things:\n\u25cf permits such Designated Parties to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u25cf provides that if such Designated Parties, or any employee, partner, member, manager, officer or director of such Designated Parties who is also one of our directors, becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nThe Designated Parties may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Furthermore, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, the Designated Parties may dispose of oil and natural gas service assets in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to the Designated Parties could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours or become more expensive for us to pursue.\nCertain of our directors, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may or may not compete with us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors, who are responsible for managing the direction of our operations, hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including affiliated entities) that are in the oil and natural gas industry. These executive officers and directors may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between these entities or whether to present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor. For additional discussion of our directors' business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest of which our stockholders should be aware, see Note 13. \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d under Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock respecting dividends, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the Class A common stock.\nIf our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things: a staggered, or classified, board of directors; permitting the majority of directors then in office, even if less than a majority, the right to fill vacancies; restricting the ability of stockholders to act by written consent or call special meetings of stockholders; supermajority requirements (75%) to\nremove directors from office; prohibitions on cumulative voting of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholders proposals; and express power to our board of directors to adopt, or alter or repeal our bylaws.\nIn addition, certain change of control events have the effect of accelerating the payment due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be substantial and accordingly serve as a disincentive to a potential acquirer of our company. Please see \"-In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, Solaris Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\"\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. However, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides for concurrent federal and state court jurisdiction over actions under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, subject to a limited exception for certain \u201ccovered class actions\u201d as defined in Section 16 of the Securities Act and interpreted by the courts. Accordingly, we believe that the exclusive forum provision would apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except to the extent a particular action fell within the exception for covered class actions or the exception in the certificate of incorporation described above otherwise applied to such action, which could occur if, for example, the action also involved claims under the Exchange Act. Stockholders will not be deemed, by operation of Article 14 of the certificate of incorporation alone, to have waived claims arising under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSolaris Inc. will be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits that it may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\nIn connection with the closing of the IPO, Solaris Inc. entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the TRA Holders (as defined herein). This agreement generally provides for the payment by Solaris Inc. to each TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in United States federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that Solaris Inc. actually realizes (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances in periods after the initial public offering as a result of certain increases in tax basis and certain benefit attributable to imputed interest. Solaris Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings. For additional information, see \u201cPayables Related to the Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d inNote 10. \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d and Note. 13 \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d under Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary\nData.\u201d The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement have been utilized or expired, unless Solaris Inc. exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement (or the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated due to other circumstances, including Solaris Inc.\u2019s breach of a material obligation thereunder or certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combinations or other changes of control), and Solaris Inc. makes the termination payment specified in the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are Solaris Inc.'s obligations and not obligations of Solaris LLC, and Solaris Inc. expects that the payments it will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. Estimating the amount and timing of payments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing Solaris Inc.\u2019s actual tax liability (determined by using the actual applicable United States federal income tax rate and an assumed combined state and local income and franchise tax rate) to the amount Solaris Inc. would have been required to pay had it not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any redemption of Solaris LLC Units, the price of Solaris Inc.\u2019s Class A common stock at the time of each redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable transactions, the amount and timing of the taxable income Solaris Inc. generates in the future, the United States federal income tax rates then applicable, and the portion of Solaris Inc.\u2019s payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis.\nThe payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon a holder of rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement having a continued ownership interest in Solaris Inc. or Solaris LLC. For additional information regarding the Tax Receivable Agreement, see Note 10. \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d under Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, Solaris Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIf we experience a change of control (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement), which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations, or the Tax Receivable Agreement terminates early, we would be required to make a substantial, immediate lump-sum payment. This payment would equal the present value of hypothetical future payments that could be required to be paid under the Tax Receivable Agreement (determined by applying a discount rate of one year London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 100 basis points). The calculation of hypothetical future payments will be based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including that (i) Solaris Inc. has sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement (including having sufficient taxable income to currently utilize any accumulated net operating loss carryforwards) and (ii) any Solaris LLC Units (other than those held by Solaris Inc.) outstanding on the termination date are deemed to be redeemed on the termination date. Any early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the termination payment relates. If we experience a change of control, such potential termination payment could have a substantial negative impact on Solaris Inc.\u2019s liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combinations or changes of control.\nFor example, if the Tax Receivable Agreement were terminated immediately after the filing of this Annual Report the estimated termination payments would, in the aggregate, be approximately $87.6 million (calculated using a discount rate equal to one year LIBOR plus 100 basis points, applied against an undiscounted liability of $93.1 million, based upon the last reported closing sale price of our Class A common stock on December 31, 2020). The foregoing number is merely an estimate and the actual payment could differ materially. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Please read Note 10. \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d under Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nAdditionally, holders of our Class A common stock could receive substantially less consideration in connection with a change of control transaction than they would receive in the absence of such obligation. Further, Solaris Inc.\u2019s payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be conditioned upon the TRA Holders having a continued\ninterest in Solaris Inc. or Solaris LLC. Accordingly, the TRA Holders' interests may conflict with those of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nFinally, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. The TRA Holders will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits that have given rise to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are subsequently disallowed. As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments that are greater than our actual cash tax savings, if any, and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we need to comply with laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d). Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupies a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and significantly increases our costs and expenses.\nFurthermore, while we must comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an \"emerging growth company\" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we may not be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until as late as our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Once it is required to do so, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nIn addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to internal controls, accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nUnder Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) our management is required to assess and report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require our independent registered public accounting firm to issue an annual report that addresses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If material weaknesses are discovered in the future, the Company\u2019s financial statements could contain additional errors which, in turn, could lead to errors in our financial reports and/or delays in our financial reporting, which could require us to further restate our operating results. As a result, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions, including delisting from the NYSE.\nAdditionally, for as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among other things: (i) comply with any new requirements if adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (ii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iii) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation.\nTo the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, you will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A common stock to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 16750, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "SOI"}
