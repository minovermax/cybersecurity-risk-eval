{"cik": "870826", "company": "EVINE Live Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the general investment risks and those factors set forth throughout this document, including those set forth under the caption \"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information,\" the following risks should be considered regarding our company.\nWe have a history of losses and a high fixed cost operating base and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations in the future.\nWe experienced operating income (losses) of approximately $(2.0) million, $(8.7) million and $1.0 million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. We reported net losses of $(8.7) million, $(12.3) million and $(1.4) million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations in future fiscal years.\nOur television shopping business operates with a high fixed cost base, primarily driven by fixed fees under distribution agreements with cable and direct-to-home satellite providers to carry our programming. In order to operate on a profitable basis, we must reach and maintain sufficient annual sales revenues to cover our high fixed cost base and/or negotiate a reduction in this cost structure. If our sales levels are not sufficient to cover our operating expenses, our ability to reduce operating expenses in the near term will be limited by the fixed cost base. In that case, our earnings, cash balance and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have had a historic trend of operating losses, which, if not reversed, could reduce our operating cash resources to the point where we will not have sufficient liquidity to meet the ongoing cash commitments and obligations to continue operating our business.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we had approximately $32.6 million in unrestricted cash, with an additional $0.5 million of restricted cash and investments. We expect to use our cash and available credit line to finance our working capital requirements and to make necessary capital expenditures in order to operate our business and to fund any further operating losses. We have had a historic trend of operating losses, which, if not reversed, could reduce our operating cash resources to the point where we would not be able to adequately fund working capital requirements or necessary capital expenditures.\nThe Company has a credit and security agreement (as amended through March 21, 2017, the \"PNC Credit Facility\") with PNC Bank, N.A. (\"PNC\"), a member of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., as lender and agent. The PNC Credit Facility, which includes The Private Bank as part of the facility, provides a revolving line of credit of $90.0 million and provides for a $15.0 million term loan which we have drawn to fund improvements at our distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The PNC Credit Facility also provides an accordion feature that would allow us to expand the size of the revolving line of credit by an additional $25.0 million at the discretion of the lenders and upon certain conditions being met. All borrowings under the PNC Credit Facility mature and are payable on May 1, 2020. Maximum borrowings and available capacity under the amended revolving PNC Credit Facility are equal to the lesser of $90 million or a calculated borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory. Remaining capacity under the PNC Credit Facility, was $19.8 million as of January 28, 2017.\nOn March 10, 2016, we entered into a five-year term loan credit and security agreement (as amended through March 21, 2017, the \"GACP Credit Agreement\") with GACP Finance Co., LLC (\"GACP\") for a term loan of $17 million. Proceeds from the term loan under the GACP Credit Agreement (the \"GACP Term Loan\") was used to provide for working capital and for general corporate purposes. The GACP Credit Agreement matures on March 9, 2021.\nWe have significant future commitments for our cash, which primarily include payments for cable and satellite program distribution obligations and the eventual repayment of the PNC Credit Facility and GACP Term Loan. Based on our current projections for fiscal 2017, we believe that our existing cash balances and available credit line will be sufficient to maintain liquidity to fund our normal business operations over the next twelve months. However, the PNC Credit Facility and GACP Term Loan include certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, and to merge or consolidate with other entities, which may be necessary in times of liquidity constraints. Therefore, there can be no assurance that, if required, we would be able to raise additional capital or reduce spending to have sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing cash commitments and obligations to continue operating our business.\nOur stock price has experienced a significant decline, which could further adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and/or cause us to be subject to securities class action litigation.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced a significant decline from which it has not fully recovered. In 2015, the sales price of our common stock, as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market, declined from a high of $6.99 in the first quarter of 2015 to a low of $0.41 in the first quarter of 2016. Most recently, on March 24, 2017, the market price of our common stock,\nas reported on The NASDAQ Global Market, closed at a price of $1.36 per share. Our progress in developing and commercializing our products, our quarterly operating results, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our perceived prospects, changes in securities\u2019 analysts\u2019 recommendations or earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations, regardless of the cause, may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. In addition, we may be subject to securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur long-term success depends, in large part, on our continued ability to attract new and retain existing customers in a cost-effective manner.\nIn an effort to attract and retain customers, we use considerable funds and resources for various marketing and merchandising initiatives, particularly for the production and distribution of television programming and the updating of our digital strategy to increasingly engage customers through digital channels. These initiatives, however, may not resonate with existing customers or consumers generally or may not be cost-effective.\nWe believe that costs associated with the production and distribution of our television programming and costs associated with digital marketing, including search engine marketing, are likely to increase in the foreseeable future. In addition, digital customers continue to increase their expectations for faster delivery times with free or reduced shipping prices. Increased delivery costs, particularly if we are unable to offset them by increasing prices without a detrimental effect on customer demand, and the extent to which we offer shipping promotions to our customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways.\nThe PNC Credit Facility and the GACP Credit Agreement contain various covenants that limit our ability and/or our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, to merge or consolidate with other entities, and to make certain restricted payments, including payments of dividends to common shareholders. In addition, certain financial covenants, including minimum EBITDA levels and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, become applicable if unrestricted cash plus facility availability falls below $18.0 million or upon an event of default. Please refer to Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources of Liquidity\u201d below for a discussion of the PNC Credit Facility and GACP Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the PNC Credit Facility or GACP Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the PNC Credit Facility and GACP Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. The PNC Credit Facility and GACP Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s personal property, as well as the Company\u2019s real properties located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota and Bowling Green, Kentucky. If the lenders and counter parties under the PNC Credit Facility and GACP Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of obligations, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such obligations. Our borrowings under the PNC Credit Facility and GACP Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will also increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income would decrease.\nOur inability to recruit and retain key employees may adversely impact our ability to sustain growth.\nOur continued growth is contingent, in part, on our ability to retain and recruit employees that have the distinct skills necessary for a business that demands knowledge of the general retail industry, merchandising and product sourcing, television production, televised and internet-based marketing and fulfillment. In recent years, we have experienced significant senior management turnover, including the resignation of Mark C. Bozek as our Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our board of directors and the appointment of Robert Rosenblatt as interim Chief Executive Officer, effective February 8, 2016, and permanent Chief Executive Officer, effective August 18, 2016. The marketplace for such key employees is very competitive and limited. Our growth may be adversely impacted if we are unable to attract and retain key employees. In addition, turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations, our vendor relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. Further we may incur significant expenses related to any executive transition costs that may impact our operating results. For example, in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, the Company recorded charges to income of $4.4 million, $3.5 million and $5.5 million, respectively, related to executive and management transition costs incurred, which\nincluded severance payments that our former Chief Executive Officers and certain other terminated executive and senior officers received.\nThe failure to secure suitable placement for our television programming and the use of digital technology to expand the number of channels and services available on cable, direct broadcast satellite and internet protocol TV-based video distribution systems could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain television viewers and could result in a decrease in revenue.\nWe are dependent upon our ability to compete for television viewers. Effectively competing for television viewers is dependent, in part, on our ability to secure placement of our television programming within a suitable programming tier at a desirable channel position. The majority of multi-video programming distributors now offer programming on a digital basis, which has resulted in increased channel capacity. While the growth of digital cable and these other systems may over time make it possible for our programming to be more widely distributed, there are several risks as well. The primary risks associated with the growth of digital cable and alternative digital platforms are demonstrated by the following:\n\u2022\nwe could experience declines in sales per digital tier subscriber because of the increased number of channels offered on digital systems competing for the same number of viewers and the higher channel location we typically are assigned in digital tiers;\n\u2022\nmore competitors may enter the marketplace as additional channel capacity is added;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to successfully negotiate renewal terms for our programming distribution agreements that are favorable to us or that offer our programming to viewers within a suitable programming tier at a desirable channel position;\n\u2022\nmore programming options being available to the viewing public in the form of new television networks and time-shifted viewing (e.g., personal video recorders, video-on-demand, interactive television and streaming video over broadband internet connections as well as increased access to various media through wireless devices); and\n\u2022\ncable, satellite, and telecommunication providers are facing competition from new services which could result in a loss of subscribers.\nNew technologies have been and are expected to continue to be developed that increase the number of entertainment choices available and the manners in which they are delivered. Failure to adapt to these risks will result in lower revenue and may adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, failure to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a cost-effective manner that meets customer demands and evolving industry standards will also reduce our revenue, adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and have a negative impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to expand or could lose some of our existing programming distribution if we cannot negotiate profitable distribution agreements.\nWe continue to seek reductions in the costs associated with our cable and satellite distribution agreements. However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve cost reductions in the future or that we will be able to maintain or grow our households on financial terms that are profitable to us. Terms of certain of our distribution agreements allow for increases or decreases in our distribution costs as a result of a variety of factors, not all of which are within our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, increases or decreases in the number of subscribers receiving our programming, channel placement changes, the addition of a second channel or other factors. Significant changes to these factors could result in a material increase in our cost of distribution. If we are unable to negotiate new or renewal terms in our distribution agreements that are more favorable to us, our distribution costs could increase. In addition, the continued consolidation of the pay television operator industry could cause us to lose leverage when negotiating new agreements or result in less favorable terms. Further, it is possible that we may need to reduce our programming distribution in certain systems if we are unable to obtain appropriate financial contract terms. Failure to successfully renew agreements covering a material portion of our existing cable and satellite households on acceptable financial and other terms could adversely affect our future growth, sales revenues and earnings unless we are able to arrange for alternative means of broadly distributing our television programming.\nCompetition in the general merchandise retailing industry and particularly the live television shopping and e-commerce sectors could limit our growth and reduce our profitability.\nAs a general merchandise retailer, we compete for consumers with other forms of retail businesses, including other television shopping and e-commerce retailers, infomercial companies, other types of consumer retail businesses, including traditional \"brick and mortar\" department stores, discount stores, warehouse stores, specialty stores, catalog and mail order retailers and other direct sellers. In the competitive television shopping sector, we compete with QVC, HSN, and Jewelry Television, as well as a number of smaller start-up and \"niche\" television shopping competitors. QVC and HSN both are substantially larger than we are in terms of annual revenues and customers, their programming is more broadly available to U.S. households than is our programming and in many markets they have more favorable channel positions than we have. Furthermore, in 2016, Amazon launched a live television program, Style Code Live, which features products that viewers can order online. This program, and any additional similar programs that Amazon may offer in the future, may compete with us. The video commerce industry is also highly competitive, with numerous e-commerce websites competing in every product category we carry, in addition to the websites\noperated by the other television shopping companies. This competition in the internet retailing sector makes it more challenging and expensive for us to attract new customers, retain existing customers and maintain desired gross margin levels.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are negatively influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending. If macroeconomic conditions do not continue to improve or if conditions worsen, our business could be adversely affected.\nRetailers generally are particularly sensitive to adverse economic and business conditions, in particular to the extent they result in a loss of consumer confidence and a decrease in consumer spending, particularly discretionary spending. If macroeconomic conditions do not continue to improve or if conditions worsen, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain our satellite services in certain situations, beyond our control, which may cause our programming to go off the air for a period of time and cause us to incur substantial additional costs.\nOur programming is presently distributed to cable systems, full-power television stations and satellite dish operators via a leased communications satellite transponder. Satellite service may be interrupted due to a variety of circumstances beyond our control, such as satellite transponder failure, satellite fuel depletion, governmental action, preemption by the satellite service provider, solar activity and service failure. Our satellite transponder agreement provides us with preemptible back-up service if satellite transmission is interrupted under certain conditions. In the event of a serious transmission interruption where back-up service is not available, we may need to enter into new arrangements, resulting in substantial additional costs and the inability to broadcast our signal for some period of time.\nThe FCC could limit must-carry rights, which would impact distribution of our television shopping programming and might impair the value of our Boston FCC license.\nIf the FCC withdraws mandatory cable carriage (or \"must-carry\") rights for TV broadcast stations carrying home shopping programming that the FCC\u2019s rules accord to other TV stations, we could lose our current carriage distribution on cable systems in two markets: Boston and Seattle, which currently constitute approximately 3.9 million full-time households receiving our programming. We own our Boston television station and have a carriage contract with the third party Seattle television station. In addition, if must-carry rights for home shopping stations are withdrawn, it may not be possible to replace these households on commercially reasonable terms and the carrying value of our Boston FCC license, which has an asset carrying value of $12.0 million as of January 28, 2017, may become further impaired.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if people or properties are harmed by products sold by us, or we may be subject to voluntary or involuntary product recalls, or subject to liability for on-air statements made by our hosts or guest-hosts.\nProducts sold by us may expose us to product liability or product safety claims relating to personal injury, death or property damage caused by such products and may require us to take actions such as product recalls, which could involve significant expense incurred by the Company.\nWe maintain, and have generally required the manufacturers and vendors of these products to carry, product liability and errors and omissions insurance. There can be no assurance that we will maintain this coverage or obtain additional coverage on acceptable terms, or that this insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims or even be available with respect to any particular claim. There also can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to maintain this insurance or that this coverage will be adequate or available with respect to any particular claims. We also require that our vendors fully indemnify us for such claims. Product liability claims could result in a material adverse impact on our financial performance.\nWe may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or we may voluntarily conduct a product recall. The costs associated with product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year, or for any particular recall event, could be significant. Although we require that our vendors fully indemnify us for such events, an involuntary product recall could result in a material adverse impact on our financial performance. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.\nIn addition, the live unscripted nature of our television broadcasting may subject us to misrepresentation or false advertising claims by our customers, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. Our Company is subject to two FTC consent decrees, one issued in 2001 and one issued in 2003; both have a duration of 20 years. They consist of claims involving recordkeeping, compliance policies, and attention to detail on claim substantiation. Violations of these decrees could result in significant civil fines and penalties.\nOur ValuePay installment payment program could lead to significant unplanned credit losses if our credit loss rate materially deteriorates.\nWe utilize an installment payment program called ValuePay that enables customers to purchase merchandise and pay for the merchandise in two or more monthly installments. Our ValuePay installment program is a key element of our promotional strategy. As of January 28, 2017, we had approximately $91.8 million due from customers under the ValuePay installment program. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. There is no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rate that we have in the past or that losses will be within current provisions. A significant increase in our credit losses above what we have been experiencing could result in a material adverse impact on our financial performance.\nFailure to comply with existing laws, rules and regulations applicable to our company, or to obtain and maintain required licenses and rights, could subject us to additional liabilities.\nWe market and provide a broad range of merchandise through multiple channels. As a result, we are subject to a wide variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions which are subject to change at any time, including laws regarding consumer protection, privacy, the regulation of retailers generally, the importation, sale and promotion of merchandise and the operation of warehouse facilities, the ownership of television stations as well as laws and regulations applicable to the internet, electronic devices and businesses engaged in e-commerce. These laws and regulations may cover subject matters including taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, payment processing, employment, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, unencumbered internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of our products and services. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, vendors, manufacturers or distributors or other third-parties with which we do business, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and proceedings against us by governmental agencies and consumers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, unfavorable changes in the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us could decrease demand for merchandise offered by us, increase costs and subject us to additional liabilities. Finally, certain of these regulations impact our marketing efforts.\nWe may be subject to claims by consumers and state and federal authorities for security breaches involving customer information, which could materially harm our reputation and business or add significant administrative and compliance cost to our operations.\nIn order to operate our business, which includes multiple retail channels, we take orders for our products from customers. This requires us to obtain personal information from these customers including, but not limited to, credit card numbers. Although we take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect customer information, there is still the risk that external or internal security breaches could occur, including cyber incidents. In addition, new tools and discoveries by third parties in computer or communications technology or software or other developments may facilitate or result in a future compromise or breach of our computer systems. Such compromises or breaches could result in data loss and/or identity theft leading to significant liability or costs to us from notification requirements, lawsuits brought by consumers, shareholders or other businesses seeking monetary redress, state and federal authorities for fines and penalties, and could also lead to interruptions in our operations and negative publicity causing damage to our reputation and limiting customers\u2019 willingness to purchase products from us. Businesses in the retail industry have experienced material sales declines after discovering data breaches, and our business could be similarly impacted. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. While reputations may take decades to build, a significant negative incident can erode trust and confidence, particularly if it results in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Theft of credit card numbers of consumers could result in significant dollar fines and consumer settlement costs, litigation costs, FTC audit requirements, and significant internal administrative costs.\nIn addition to possible claims for security breaches involving customer information, the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of customer information is critical to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protect our customer information. The expenses associated with complying with a patchwork of state laws imposing differing security requirements depending on the residence of our customers could reduce our operating margins. As mentioned above, there have been continuing efforts to increase the legal and regulatory obligations and restrictions on companies conducting commerce, primarily in the areas of taxation, consumer privacy and protection of consumer personal information, and we may have to devote significant resources to information security.\nNearly all of our sales are paid for by customers using credit or debit cards and the increasingly heightened Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards regarding the storage and security of customer information could potentially impact our ability to accept card brands.\nNearly all of our customers pay for purchases via a credit or debit card. Credit and debit card brand issuers continue to heighten PCI standards that are applicable to all merchants who accept these cards. These standards primarily pertain to the processes and procedures for encrypted use and secure storage of customer data. By virtue of the volume of our overall credit card transactions, we are a Level 1 merchant which requires the annual completion of a formal Report of Compliance (\"ROC\") by a Qualified Security Assessor. Failure to comply with PCI standards, as required by card issuers, could result in card brand fines and/or the possible inability for us to accept a card brand. Our inability to accept one or all card brands could materially adversely affect sales. We received an approved ROC on July 26, 2016.\nWe depend on relationships with numerous manufacturers and suppliers for our products and proprietary brands; a decrease in product quality or an increase in product cost, the unanticipated loss of our larger suppliers, or the lack of customer receptivity or brand acceptance to our proprietary brands could impact our sales.\nWe procure merchandise from numerous manufacturers and suppliers generally pursuant to short-term contracts and purchase orders. Our ability to identify, establish and maintain relationships with these parties, as well as access quality merchandise in a timely and efficient manner on acceptable terms and at acceptable costs, can be challenging. We depend on the ability of these parties to timely produce and deliver goods that meet applicable quality standards, which is impacted by a number of factors not within the control of these parties, such as political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, and transport capacity and costs, among others, and to deliver products that meet or exceed our customers\u2019 expectations.\nOur failure to identify new vendors and manufacturers, maintain relationships with a significant number of existing vendors and manufacturers and/or access quality merchandise in a timely and efficient manner could cause us to miss customer delivery dates or delay scheduled promotions, which could result in the failure to meet customer expectations and could cause customers to cancel orders or cause us to be unable to source merchandise in sufficient quantities, which could result in lost sales.\nIt is possible that one or more of our larger suppliers could experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, or otherwise could determine to cease doing business with us. During fiscal 2016, products purchased from one vendor accounted for approximately 16% of our consolidated net sales. The unanticipated loss of this supplier or any other large supplier could impact our sales and earnings. We have periodically experienced the loss of a major vendor and if a number of our larger vendors ceased doing business with us, this could materially and adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nOur efforts to accelerate the development of proprietary brands may require working capital investments for the development and promotion of new brands and concepts. In addition, factors such as minimum purchase quantities and reduced merchandise return rights, typically associated with the purchasing of products associated with proprietary brands, can lead to excess on-hand inventory if sales of these brands do not meet our expectations due to a lack of customer receptivity or brand acceptance. Our ability to successfully offer a wider assortment of proprietary merchandise may also be adversely impacted if any of the risks mentioned above related to our manufacturers and suppliers materialize.\nMany of our key functions are concentrated in a single location, and a natural disaster could seriously impact our ability to operate.\nOur television broadcast studios, internet operations, IT systems, merchandising team, inventory control systems, executive offices and finance/accounting functions, among others, are centralized in our adjacent offices at 6740 and 6690, Shady Oak Road in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. In addition, our only fulfillment and distribution facility is centralized at a location in Bowling Green, Kentucky. A natural disaster, such as a tornado, could seriously disrupt our ability to continue or resume normal operations for some period of time. While we have certain business continuity plans in place, no assurances can be given as to how quickly we would be able to resume operations and how long it may take to return to normal operations. We could incur substantial financial losses above and beyond what may be covered by applicable insurance policies, and may experience a loss of customers, vendors and employees during the recovery period.\nWe could be subject to additional sales tax collection obligations and claims for uncollected amounts.\nOver the past several years, a number of states have adopted legislation that require out-of-state retailers to collect and remit sales tax on transactions originating on the internet or by other remote means such as television shopping, infomercial and catalog distribution. These new laws seek to assert indirect physical \"nexus\" by the out-of-state retailer based on (i) the presence in the state of e-commerce \"click-thru\" affiliates who are paid by the retailer to direct e-commerce traffic to the retailer through independent websites or (ii) by the presence in the state of companies with which the out-of-state retailer shares common ownership or (iii) by generating sales above certain thresholds within the state. These laws are being challenged by internet and other retailers under federal constitutional grounds, but court challenges have to date been largely unsuccessful. We continually monitor this legislation\nand, depending upon our facts in the state, have either registered to collect tax (such as in New York, North Carolina, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Alabama) or have confirmed that we have no direct or indirect physical relationships with the state at the time such legislation becomes effective. Several new state legislatures are introducing similar legislation each year, and federal legislation, which could require nationwide collection from all of our customers, has also been introduced in the federal House and Senate. If the trend toward expanded nexus continues and the laws are upheld after legal challenges, we could be required to collect additional state and local sales taxes in many additional jurisdictions. Adding sales tax to our transactions could negatively impact consumer demand, create a competitive disadvantage (if all retailers are not equally impacted), and create an additional costly administrative burden of complying with the collection laws of multiple jurisdictions. While we believe we comply with current state sales tax regulations, a successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nWe place a significant reliance on technology and information management tools and operational applications to run our existing businesses, the failure of which could adversely impact our operations.\nOur businesses are dependent, in part, on the use of sophisticated technology, some of which is provided to us by third parties. These technologies include, but are not necessarily limited to, satellite based transmission of our programming, use of the internet and other mobile commerce devices in relation to our on-line business, new digital technology used to manage and supplement our television broadcast operations, the age of our legacy operational applications to distribute product to our customers and a network of complex computer hardware and software to manage an ever increasing need for information and information management tools. The failure of any of these legacy systems or operational infrastructure elements, technologies, or our inability to have this technology supported, updated, expanded or integrated into new business processes or other technologies, could adversely impact our operations. Although we have, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into our computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts to date would protect us against all potential issues or disaster occurrences related to the loss of any such technologies or their use. Further, we may face challenges in keeping pace with rapid technological changes and adopting new products or platforms and migrating to new systems.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan to preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits, including those generated by net operating losses, as described further below under Part II, Item 5 below. The Shareholder Rights Plan may have anti-takeover effects. The provisions of the Shareholder Rights Plan could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control of us and could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77007, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "IMBI"}
