{"cik": "903129", "company": "GENTHERM Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this Report, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings or furnishings with the SEC. We believe these risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe automotive industry, our primary market, is cyclical and a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we supply significant amounts of product, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Automotive segment represents 95%, 91% and 89% of our product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Demand for our automotive products is directly related to automotive vehicle production, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. Automotive sales and production are cyclical and have been, and we expect will continue to be, materially affected by general economic and industry conditions, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the availability and cost of credit for us, customers and consumers and other factors. IHS Markit recently forecasted light vehicle production volumes of 87.2 million units, a decline of 1.9% from 2019.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors, as well as new non-traditional entrants to the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe automotive component supply industry is subject to intense competition. Business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost, quality, timely delivery, technological innovation and service. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. Further, our competitors\u2019 efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Many of our competitors are substantially larger in size and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and therefore may be more effective in adapting to customer requirements while being more profitable.\nIn addition, the global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change. Future automotive vehicle production may be affected by additional industry or consumer behaviors, including the development and use of autonomous and electric vehicles and increasing use of car- and ride-sharing and on-demand transportation as a service, as well as related\nregulations. The rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants, including new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. Further, in comparison to us, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately, develop superior products, produce similar products at a lower cost, or adapt quicker to new technologies.\nIf we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures, acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business, our business could be materially adversely harmed.\nWe regularly consider opportunities to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances that could leverage our products and capabilities, as well as, enhance our customer base, geographic penetration and scale, to complement our current businesses, some of which could be material. Finding and assessing a potential growth opportunity and completing a transaction involves extensive due diligence, management time and expense; however, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited. Further, we can give no assurance that new business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned, including regarding anticipated synergies. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations, internal controls and general operating procedures. Further, for significant transactions, we would expect to incur additional debt, issue equity and/or increase capital expenditures, which may increase leverage risks, result in dilution or reduce capital available for other investments in ongoing operations. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and results of operations could be materially impacted. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Given our limited history in the patient temperature management business, the foregoing risks may be heightened due to our lack of experience in integrating similar businesses.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s ongoing Fit-for-Growth initiative, the Company consummated divestitures to eliminate investments in non-core businesses, and the Company may consider strategic dispositions in the future. However, we may not achieve some or all of the targeted results we originally anticipated at the time of disposition, and we may need to provide material transition services or retain material liabilities to complete the transaction, any of which could have an adverse impact on our returns and our overall profitability.\nThe loss or insolvency of any of our principal customers would adversely affect our future results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our top two customers were Lear and Adient which comprised 16% and 15%, respectively, of our product revenues. We are dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers, as well as the OEMS to which our products are supplied. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to any of our customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we have significant receivable balances related to these customers that would be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy or other restructuring.\nWe manage our business based on projected future sales volume, which is highly dependent on information received from customers and general market data, and any inaccuracies or changes in such information could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe manage our business based upon projected future sales volumes, which are based upon many factors, including awarded business and assumptions of conversion rates thereof, customers\u2019 forecasts and general market data. Our customers generally do not guarantee sales volumes. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty at any time. Further, our customers\u2019 forecasts are subject to numerous assumptions, and such forecasts often are/may be changed rapidly with limited notice. Therefore, our actual sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales, are not committed. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with our projected future sales volumes, we could realize substantially less revenue and incur greater expenses over the life of vehicle programs.\nOur inability to achieve product cost reductions which offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial performance.\nDownward pricing pressure is customarily applied by automotive manufacturers to the automotive supply chain. Our customer contracts generally provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, while requiring us to assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products. Prices may also be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/costs and other commercial factors. Our inability to achieve product cost reductions that offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to effectively manage the development, timing, quality and costs of new product launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nGentherm is developing and launching new products and related technologies for its battery thermal management and electronic and software systems businesses, and intends to launch other new products in the future. The launch of products employing new technologies is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the robustness of our product and manufacturing process development, success in sourcing new components and commodities with suitable suppliers, readiness of our and our suppliers' manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Given the complexity of new product launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs. However, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers\u2019 introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business, vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down. Such operating failures could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives, and could result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor. Any of the foregoing matters could result in a significant loss of revenue and market shares and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows.\nOur ability to market our products successfully depends on acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers and consumers, as well as the success of our customers.\nWe have been, and will continue to be, required to educate potential customers and demonstrate that the merits of our existing products justify the costs associated with them. Similar efforts will be required with existing and potential customers for additional products we develop using technologies we develop or license. Customers will only include our products if there appears to be consumer demand. For our automotive products, we rely on OEMs and applicable dealer networks to market our products to consumers, and we do not have any control over the marketing budget or messaging nor the training of employees and agents regarding our products. Further, OEMs and dealer networks may market products offered by our competitors, including products manufactured by such OEMs. If customers or consumers conclude that temperature control seats or our other automotive products are unnecessary or too expensive or that our competitors offer more favorable sales terms or better products, OEMs and other manufacturers may reduce availability or decline to include our products in their vehicles.\nAdverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability and business reputation.\nOur supply chain may be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, including macro-economic events, trade restrictions, political crises, labor relations issues, liquidity constraints, natural or environmental occurrences or other factors noted herein that can adversely affect us, which may adversely affect our operations and profitability. In particular, many of our products include TEDs, which contain certain raw materials that generally cannot be substituted. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Tellurium, a raw material used in TEDs, and other key raw materials include copper, silver and petroleum-based engineered plastics. If the market prices for these raw materials significantly increases, as they have in the past, our gross profit may be adversely impacted to the extent our suppliers pass those price increases on to us.\nIf our suppliers fail to deliver products, parts and components of sufficient quality and to our other stated written expectations on a timely basis, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of our key products or to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion which would adversely affect sales, margins and customer relations. Furthermore, unfavorable economic or industry conditions could result in financial distress within our supply base, thereby increasing the risk of supply disruption.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes.\nIf certain of our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products for any reason, we may be unable to meet production requirements, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. Without operation of certain existing production facilities, we may be limited in our ability to deliver products until we restore the manufacturing capability at the particular facility, find an alternative manufacturing facility or arrange an alternative source of supply.\nWe maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales, harm to our business reputation or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Further, any such proceeds may be received and accounted for in a different reporting period, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow generally or for a specific reporting period.\nWork stoppages, including those at our customers, and similar events could significantly disrupt our business\nBecause the automotive industry relies heavily on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of components, a work stoppage at one or more of Gentherm's production facilities could have adverse effects on the business. Similarly, if one or more of our direct customers or an OEM were to experience a work stoppage, such as what occurred during the General Motors labor strike occurring in fall 2019, our customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could result in the temporary shutdown of the related Gentherm production facilities or other restructuring initiatives.\nOur global operations subject us to risks that may harm our operations and financial results.\nIn 2019, 55% of our product revenue was generated from sales to customers outside the United States. We have significant personnel, property, equipment and operations in a number of countries outside of the United States, including Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia, Mexico, Ukraine and Vietnam. Our exposure to the risks described below is substantial. We also derive a significant portion of revenues from Europe and Asia and conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies.\nIn addition to the general risks relating to our operations, our international operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic, political and labor conditions.\n\u2022\ndifferent and complex local laws and regulations and enforcement thereof, including those relating to governance, taxes, litigation, anti-corruption, employment, employee benefits, environmental, competition, permitting, investment, product regulations, repatriation, and export/import restrictions or requirements, such as the recently implemented revised emissions test procedure in Europe referred to as the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure that has limited the production of certain vehicles as OEMs have struggled to meet the new requirements;\n\u2022\nincreases in duties, tariffs and taxation on our products related to U.S. trade disputes; trade restrictions and potential trade wars, including limitation on imports or exports of components or assembled products, unilaterally or bilaterally;\n\u2022\nexposure to infectious disease and epidemics, including the effects on our business operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak, such as the ongoing coronavirus outbreak that began in China;\n\u2022\nviolence and civil unrest (including acts of terrorism, drug-cartel related and other forms of violence and outbreaks of war);\n\u2022\nexpropriation, nationalization or other protectionist activities;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; in particular, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Vietnamese Dong, the Hungarian Forint, the Macedonian Denar, the Ukrainian Hryvnia, and the Mexican Peso;\n\u2022\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in due to anti-corruption laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries.\nIn particular, we derived over 20% of our revenue in fiscal 2019 (based on shipment destination) from Japan, China and South Korea. We have three manufacturing facilities in China, and several of our customers, subcontractors and suppliers also are located in China as well as Japan and South Korea. As a result of the coronavirus, our operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, have experienced and in the future may experience delays or disruptions, such as difficulty obtaining components, travel restrictions and temporary suspension of operations. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that coronavirus or any other epidemic or outbreak harms motor vehicle product consumption specifically and the economies of China, Japan and South Korea and the world generally\nAdditionally, our primary manufacturing locations are in Mexico, China, Vietnam, Macedonia and Ukraine, all countries that have historically experienced a heightened degree of political, civil and labor uncertainty. Political conflict and related demonstrations and violence in Ukraine in recent years, for example, highlights the risks to our foreign manufacturing facilities. Although our manufacturing facility in Ukraine is located approximately 700 miles by road from Kiev, and approximately the same distance from the activities along the border of Ukraine and Russia where fighting has occurred, we cannot be certain that similar demonstrations, unrest and international tensions will not affect our facility in the future, including due to electrical outages and periodic battles with separatists closer to our facility. In addition, certain of our employees in Ukraine are routinely conscripted into the military and/or sent to the Russian border to fight in the ongoing conflict. Furthermore, most of our products manufactured in Ukraine are shipped across the border from Ukraine to Hungary for further delivery to our customers. If that border crossing were to be closed or restricted for any reason, we would essentially experience a loss of the use of our Ukrainian facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments.\nWe receive economic benefits from national, state and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain or increase investment, workforce or production. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies and tax abatements or credits. The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to fund new investments.\nChanges to trade policy, including tariffs and customs regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico. As a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, there may be changes to existing trade agreements, like NAFTA and its anticipated successor agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) which is still subject to approval by Canada, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico, among other possible changes.\nAdditionally, during 2018, the U.S. and China applied significant tariffs to certain of each other\u2019s exports. The institution of trade tariffs, both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically, carries the risk of negatively impacting overall economic conditions, which could have negative repercussions on the Company. More directly, imposition of tariffs has caused and could cause further increases in the costs of our raw materials which we may not be able to pass on to our customers in part or in full, which would directly and negatively impact our business. We purchase a significant amount of raw material components, including products\nmanufactured in our China facilities, which are subject to such tariffs. The imposition of tariffs has caused and could cause further increases in the costs of our raw materials, and we may not be able to mitigate the impact from these tariffs or additional future tariffs.\nMost recently, a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal signed between the U.S. and China on January 15, 2020 accompanied a U.S. decision to cancel a plan to increase tariffs on an additional list of Chinese products. While the signing of the agreement signals a cooling of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade, concerns over the stability of bilateral trade relations remain, particularly given the limited scope of the phase one agreement. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs, the executive order and its implementation and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business, including in the form of increase cost of goods sold, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative impact on global economic conditions, financial markets and our financial results.\nThe United Kingdom left the European Union January 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d). Under the current withdrawal agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom will be subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, during which European Union rules will continue to apply. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union after the transition period has not been determined yet. As a result, the impact of Brexit is not yet known and depends on any agreements the United Kingdom and European Union may make to retain access to each other's markets after the transition period. The measures or lack of any agreement may continue to impact global light vehicle production, and affect the business of and/or our relationships with our customers and suppliers, as well as alter the relationship among tariffs and currencies. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainly and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to data privacy. A withdrawal from the European Union is unprecedented and it is unclear what financial, trade, legal and employment implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have following the transition period and how the withdrawal will affect us. Adverse consequences such as reduced consumer spending, deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in exchange rates, and prohibitive laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nTax matters, including changes in the corporate tax rates, disagreement with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax legislation and other initiatives. For example, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Act contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of earnings (except for certain small business), limitation of the deduction for net operation losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of NOL carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they were repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), new taxes on certain foreign earnings, a new minimum tax related to payment to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. It remains uncertain if, and to what extent, various states will conform to the Tax Act and if foreign countries will react by adopting tax legislation or taking other actions.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our result of operations and financial position.\nWe also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Act, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\nOur patient temperature management business is subject to extensive industry regulation and failure to comply with all applicable rules and regulation may adversely impact us.\nOur patient temperature management products are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. In the United States, this is principally administered by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). Various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our medical products are sold also regulate that business. Under both United States and foreign country\nregulations, we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities (including third-party facilities that are performing services for us), procedures and operations and testing of our products. Following such FDA inspections, should any noncompliance with regulations or other quality issues be noted, we may receive observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could require us to get FDA approval of a corrective action plan and modify certain activities identified during the inspection, possibly at a significant cost. We are also required to report adverse events associated with our medical products to the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities where our products have been approved or received market clearance. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in liability claims, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses or, in rare circumstances, market withdrawal of the product.\nThe process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market new medical devices is time-consuming and costly. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping any new medical products. We cannot be certain that any new medical products we develop will receive FDA or other necessary approvals. Also receipt of approval in one country does not guarantee approval by the FDA or any other foreign regulatory agency.\nDefects or quality issues associated with our medical products could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical products involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to regulatory action, injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall, inadequate disclosure or defect could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements, such as further clinical testing. Such clinical testing is costly and time-consuming and could delay market approval or the meeting of additional post-market requirements.\nAny failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results.\nOur operations outside of the United States require us to comply with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law. Violations of these laws, which are complex and often difficult to interpret and apply, could result in significant criminal penalties or sanctions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to significant foreign currency risk and foreign exchange exposure related to our global operations.\nA significant portion of our global transactions is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. While we sometimes employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, developing an effective and economical foreign currency risk strategy is complex and expensive and no strategy can completely insulate us from those exposures. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely affect our financial results and comparability of results from period to period.\nWe use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in many of the markets that we serve.\nWe cannot guarantee, however, that we will be able to secure all desired protection, nor that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate, to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. In addition, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, such as China, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Foreign governments may adopt regulations, and foreign governments or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights, or foreign governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies or provide reduced protection relative to other countries.\nA significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers, or an investigation regarding vehicle safety generally, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn the event that our products fail to perform as expected, whether allegedly due to our fault or that of one of our suppliers, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, and we have been in the past and may again be required or requested by our customers or regulators to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. We also are a party to agreements with certain of our customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims. We carry insurance for certain product liability claims, and have utilized such insurance periodically. However, such coverage may be limited for future claims. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including suppliers, in connection with these claims. These types of claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are involved from time to time in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with our customers, suppliers or competitors, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental matters, tax matters and employment matters. Such legal and regulatory proceedings could result in an adverse outcome for the Company that would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends in part on retaining key personnel and effective succession planning.\nOur success will depend to a large extent upon the continued contributions of key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could adversely affect our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Further, our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified engineering and other technical and marketing personnel. There is significant competition for technologically qualified personnel in our business and we may not be successful in recruiting or retaining sufficient qualified personnel.\nWe are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us in the future. We may also assume, or be deemed to assume, significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions. Environmental liability may be imposed without regard to fault, and under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. No assurance can be given that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner or operator of our properties or former properties has created an environmental condition not known to us. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Violations of these requirements could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination, third party property damage or personal injury claims due to the migration of contaminants off-site, or modification or revocation of our operating permits, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results.\nWe may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions, which could adversely affect our profitability and operations.\nWe have undertaken significant restructuring activities in recent years that remain ongoing, and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure, lower our cost base, improve our financial performance and cash flow generation, and create a simplified organization best positioned to deliver on our key financial and operational priorities. Charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned, on a timely basis or at all, will be on budget, or achieve the desired results.\nOur existing indebtedness and the inability to access capital markets could restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total consolidated indebtedness was $80.6 million. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This significant amount of debt could have important, adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy other obligations;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nreducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our businesses\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and industries; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise;\nOur debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: incur additional debt, make certain payments or distributions (including for the repurchase or redemption of our shares), engage in mergers or consolidations, make certain dispositions and transfers of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee indebtedness. While not unusual for financings of the type that we have, the restrictions in our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions.\nTo the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt.\nIf an event of default would occur under our existing debt agreements or any additional indebtedness, our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to all lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, under our existing credit facilities, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition\nOur current outstanding variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. We expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be created and implemented prior to the 2021 target date. Fallback provisions are being written into LIBOR-based contracts to attempt to reduce the risk of sudden and unpredictable increases in the cost of variable rate indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments.\nAdditionally, in the future, we may need to renegotiate our existing indebtedness or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information or personal information.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including electronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company personnel and our customers and suppliers, supply chain management, manufacturing, and invoicing and collection of payments. We use these information technology network and systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, customers and suppliers, in data centers, on information technology networks and systems, some of which are operated by third parties and third-party locations. The secure operation of these data centers, information technology networks, and systems and the processing, maintenance, confidentiality, integrity and availability of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy.\nThe Company maintains an information risk management program which is supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee. As part of this program, reports that include analysis of emerging risks as well as the Company\u2019s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management and the Board of Directors. Despite security measures, such as disaster recovery and business continuity plans, including those measures related to cybersecurity, these data centers, our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage, corruption, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, geopolitical events, or natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nCyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events, many of which are outside our control, could compromise our systems or networks and the information stored there, which may include confidential or proprietary information or personal information of third parties, could be accessed, publicly disclosed, compromised, corrupted, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss or corruption of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, cause a loss of confidence in our reputation, goodwill, products and services, reduce the competitive advantage we expect to derive from our investment in advanced technologies and adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations, and cash flows. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nWe may face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks.\nLegislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws. In particular, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, including the new California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and other similar state laws recently or soon to be enacted, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. Furthermore, the CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and many of its requirements have not yet been interpreted by courts, and best practices are still being developed by the industry, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures may affect our ability to accurately report our financial results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, fail to prevent fraud and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we must maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, which requires significant resources and management oversight. Effectiveness of such controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company.\nOur management determined we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, which we determined was remediated as of September 30, 2019. Any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, or timely effect any necessary improvement of such controls, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could subject us to adverse regulatory consequences. Ineffectiveness of such controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe are currently restricted in our ability to make dividend payments on our Common Stock. Furthermore, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our Common Stock in the near future.\nOur bank credit facilities generally restrict our ability to pay cash of dividends on our Common Stock so long as such facilities are outstanding. We have never paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future.\nThe price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the automotive industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced significant stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.", "PERMNO": 79248, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "THRM"}
