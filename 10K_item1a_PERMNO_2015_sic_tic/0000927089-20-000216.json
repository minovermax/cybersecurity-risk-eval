{"cik": "1767837", "company": "Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included and incorporated by reference in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, capital levels, cash flows, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. The market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose some or all of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe accrued a substantial expense in 2019 in connection with our intended termination of First Bank Richmond\u2019s participation in a defined benefit pension plan (the \u201cDB Plan\u201d), which eliminated all of our earnings for 2019. The actual expense related to the termination of the DB Plan will not be known until the plan obligations are purchased by an insurance company or other buyer. As a result, the actual termination expense could be higher or lower than the amount we accrued for in 2019, and may impact our results of operations in 2020.\nThe DB Plan that First Bank Richmond participates in is an industry-wide, tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan which covers substantially all of its employees. First Bank Richmond is in the process of terminating its participation in the DB Plan, which will require us to pay an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. As of December 31, 2019, we have estimated and accrued for approximately $14.3 million, after tax, for this expense. Our actual termination expense may be higher or lower depending on a number of factors, including but not limited to the interest rate environment and the valuation of plan assets, which may impact our results of operations in 2020.\nWe have a substantial amount of commercial and multi-family real estate and commercial and industrial loans, and intend to continue to increase originations of these types of loans. These loans involve credit risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to continue to originate and purchase commercial and multi-family real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans. At December 31, 2019, our commercial real estate, multi-family real estate and commercial and industrial loans totaled $380.0 million, or 54.7% of our total loans and leases, with approximately $97.4 million of these loans, or 14.2% of our total loans and leases, located in the Columbus, Ohio market. While these types of loans are potentially more profitable than residential mortgage loans, they are generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels more difficult to predict. These loans also generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial and multi-family real estate and commercial and industrial loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans we originate. Because the repayment of these types of loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment can be affected by adverse conditions in the local, regional and national real estate market or economy. A downturn in the real estate market or the local, regional and national economy could adversely impact the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans. Further, unlike residential mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may depreciate over time, may be more difficult to appraise or liquidate and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at default. As our commercial and multi-family real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nOur portfolio of loans with a higher risk of loss is increasing and the unseasoned nature of our commercial loan portfolio may result in errors in judging its collectability, which may lead to additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, which would hurt our profits.\nOur commercial loan portfolio, which includes commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans, has increased to $433.4 million, or 62.4% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2019 from $226.9 million, or 48.5% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2016. A large portion of our commercial loan portfolio is unseasoned, meaning they were originated recently. Our limited experience with these borrowers does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. Further, these loans have not been subjected to unfavorable economic conditions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses is not sufficient to cover actual losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. We cannot be certain that our allowance for loan and lease losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets, and changes in borrower behaviors. Differences between our actual experience and assumptions and the effectiveness of our models may adversely affect our business, financial condition, including liquidity and capital, and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, adopted Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d or CECL, on June 16, 2016, which changed the loss model to take into account current expected credit losses. This accounting pronouncement is expected to be applicable to us, as an emerging growth company, effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023. The federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital.\nCECL substantially changes how we calculate our allowance for loan and lease losses. We are evaluating CECL and when we will be required to adopt it. We cannot predict when and how it will affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our regulatory capital. See \u201c- We are subject to an extensive body of accounting rules and best practices. Periodic changes to such rules may change the treatment and recognition of critical financial line items and affect our profitability.\u201d\nA worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nLocal economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. A deterioration in economic conditions could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u00b7\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u00b7\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u00b7\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and\n\u00b7\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general local, regional or national economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, severe weather, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nThe coronavirus outbreak may also have an adverse effect on our clients directly or indirectly, including those engaged in international trade, travel and tourism. These effects could include disruptions or restrictions in customers' supply chains or employee productivity, closures of clients' facilities, decreases in demand for clients' products and services or in other economic activities. Their businesses may be adversely affected by quarantines and travel restrictions in countries most affected by the coronavirus. In addition, entire industries such as agriculture, may be adversely impacted due to lower exports caused by reduced economic activity in the affected countries. If our clients are adversely affected, or if the virus leads to a widespread health crisis that impacts U.S. economic growth, our condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio could hurt our profits and reduce our capital levels.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts\u2019 reports and, to a lesser extent given the relatively insignificant levels of depreciation in our debt portfolio, spread differentials between the effective rates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. In analyzing an equity issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers industry analysts\u2019 reports, financial performance and projected target prices of investment analysts within a one-year time frame. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. Declines in market value could result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. As of December 31, 2019, we have no securities that are deemed impaired.\nA tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. A tightening of the credit markets and the inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits and fund continued loan growth may affect asset growth, our earnings capability and capital levels negatively. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, including brokered deposits, as well as cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio. Borrowings, especially from the Federal Home Loan Bank and repurchase agreements, also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include adverse regulatory action against us or a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated. Our ability to borrow also could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry or deterioration in credit markets.\nOur utilization of time deposits, including brokered certificates of deposit, as a source of funds for loans and our other liquidity needs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe rely primarily on deposits for funds to make loans and provide for our other liquidity needs, including time deposits and brokered certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2019, brokered certificates of deposit represented 9.2% of our total deposits. Such deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and, in the future, depositors may not renew those time deposits when they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to attract or keep them or to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources. Not being able to attract those deposits or to keep or replace them as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Additionally, we are regulated by the FDIC, which requires us to maintain certain capital levels to be considered \"well capitalized.\" If we fail to maintain these capital levels, we could lose our ability to obtain funding through brokered deposits. In addition, we may also be restricted from paying higher deposit rates to attract, keep or replace those deposits, which could have a negative effect on our operating results and the value of our common stock.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate. Changes include (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. The recent changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan and lease losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use estimates in determining the fair value of certain assets, such as mortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d). If our estimates prove to be incorrect, we may be required to write down the value of these assets which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe sell a portion of our one- to four-family loans in the secondary market. We generally retain the right to service these loans through First Bank Richmond. At December 31, 2019, the book value of our MSRs was $1.0 million. We use a financial model that uses, wherever possible, quoted market prices to value our MSRs. This model is complex and also uses assumptions related to interest and discount rates, prepayment speeds, delinquency and foreclosure rates and ancillary fee income. Valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the model. The primary risk associated with MSRs is that they will lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments occasioned by declining interest rates. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated. If prepayment speeds increase more than estimated, or delinquency and default levels are higher than anticipated, we may be required to write down the value of our MSRs which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. We obtain independent valuations annually to determine if impairment in the asset exists.\nIf our investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis becomes impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity could decrease.\nAt December 31, 2019, we owned $7.6 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) of Indianapolis stock. We are required to own this stock to be a member of and to obtain advances from the FHLB of Indianapolis. This stock is not marketable and can only be redeemed by the FHLB of Indianapolis. The most recent stock buyback initiated by the FHLB of Indianapolis was in 2015. The FHLB of Indianapolis\u2019 financial condition is linked, in part, to the eleven other members of the FHLB System and to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their capital, which would cause our FHLB of Indianapolis stock to be deemed impaired, resulting in a decrease in our earnings and assets.\nOur size makes it more difficult for us to compete.\nOur asset size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions that are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Our lower earnings may also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. In addition, our smaller customer base may make it difficult to generate meaningful non-interest income from such activities as securities brokerage or the sale of insurance products. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations.\nAs a community bank, maintaining our reputation in our market area is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. We operate in many different financial service businesses and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a significant number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss from operations, including fraud by employees or outside persons, employees\u2019 execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions, data processing and technology errors or hacking and breaches of internal control systems. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and because of our reliance on technology.\nOur business requires us to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and our own business, operations, plans and business strategies. Our operational and security systems infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. Our operational risks include the risk of malfeasance by employees or persons outside our company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.\nIn the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, civil litigation and/or suffer damage to our reputation. Although to date we have not experienced any technology failures, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or other consequences in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and our role as a provider of financial services, our continuous transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, including our vendors and regulators, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, threats of cyber-terrorism, and system and customer account updates and conversions. As a result, cyber-security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority.\nOur information technology systems may be subject to failure, interruption or security breaches.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions and security breaches, including privacy breaches and cyber-attacks, and, although we have not experienced any such events to date, such failures, interruptions or breaches may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.\nThere have been increasing efforts by third parties to breach data security at financial institutions. Such attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information, damages to systems, or other material disruptions to network access or business operations. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. Although we take protective measures, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Because the techniques used to cause security breaches change frequently, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing requirements to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with those service providers, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. To our knowledge, the services and programs provided to us by third parties have not suffered any security breaches. However, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and affect the value of our assets and liabilities.\nNet income is the amount by which net interest income and non-interest income exceed non-interest expense, the provision for loan and lease losses and taxes. Net interest income makes up a majority of our net income and is based on the difference between:\n\u00b7\nthe interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u00b7\nthe interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many financial institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities. A decline in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans) can reduce a financial institution\u2019s net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions that originate longer-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans. At December 31, 2019, 44.7% of our loan and lease portfolio consisted of fixed-rate loans and leases.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and liabilities and ultimately affect our earnings. Beginning in August 2019 the Federal Reserve has reduced the targeted Fed Funds rate 25 basis points three times to a range of 1.50% to 1.75% at December 31, 2019 in response to some recent weaknesses in economic data and indicated possible further decreases, subject to economic conditions. In a rare emergency move, the Federal Reserve Board further lowered the targeted federal funds rate in March 2020, to a range of 0% to 0.25% in response to the evolving risks the coronavirus outbreak poses to the economy. This decrease may negatively impact our net interest income.\nWe monitor interest rate risk through the use of simulation models, including estimates of the amounts by which the fair value of our assets, liabilities and equity (our economic value of equity or \u201cEVE\u201d) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we estimate that we would experience an 8.04% decrease in EVE. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Economic Value of Equity\u201d contained in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nUncertainty relating to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. The Federal Reserve Board, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not consider bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question, although some transactions using SOFR have been completed in 2019, including by Fannie Mae. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have recently announced that they will cease accepting adjustable rate mortgages tied to LIBOR by the end of 2020 and will soon begin accepting mortgages based on SOFR. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in our portfolio. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may experience significant expenses in effecting the transition which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and securities brokerage firms and unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, some of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates and fees on more attractive terms than loans we offer. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans due to competition, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. For additional information see \u201cBusiness\u2212 Market Area\u201d and \u201c\u2212 Competition\u201d contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nFirst Bank Richmond is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC and the Indiana DFI, and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and the depositors of First Bank Richmond, rather than for our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan and lease losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firm. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201c - We are subject to an extensive body of accounting rules and best practices. Periodic changes to such rules may change the treatment and recognition of critical financial line items and affect our profitability.\u201d\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the regulation of banks and savings institutions and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies have exercised significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations. It will be some time before the full effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder can be assessed. Compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations and policies has already resulted in changes to our business and operations, as well as additional costs, and has diverted management\u2019s time from other business activities, all of which have adversely affected our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to an extensive body of accounting rules and best practices. Periodic changes to such rules may change the treatment and recognition of critical financial line items and affect our profitability.\nThe nature of our business makes us sensitive to the large body of accounting rules in the United States. From time to time, the governing bodies that oversee changes to accounting rules and reporting requirements may release new guidance for the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some instances, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. Changes which have been approved for future implementation, or which are currently proposed or expected to be proposed or adopted include requirements that we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses on the basis of the current expected credit losses over the lifetime of our loans, referred to as the CECL model, which is expected to be applicable to us, as an emerging growth company, beginning in 2023. CECL adoption will have broad impact on our financial statements, which will affect key profitability and solvency measures, including, but not limited to higher loan loss reserve levels and related deferred tax assets. Increased reserve levels also may lead to a reduction in capital levels. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the CECL model, banks will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. The forward-looking modeling required by CECL relies on a number of macroeconomic variables. Unexpected changes to such indicators between periods could potentially result in greater earnings volatility from period to period. Our reserves may need to be adjusted in response to not only to our actual experience, but also to external factors. If we are required to materially increase the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn additional impact of CECL will be the asymmetry in accounting between loan related income, which will continue to be recognized on a periodic basis based on the effective interest method, and the related credit losses, which will be recognized up front at origination. This will make periods of loan expansion seem less profitable due to the immediate recognition of expected credit losses. Periods of stable or declining loan levels will look comparatively more profitable as the income trickles in for loans, where losses had been previously recognized.\nWe are evaluating the impact the CECL accounting model will have on our accounting, but expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations. The federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are suspected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on pursuing acquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Furthermore, these rules and regulations continue to evolve and expand. Although to date we have not been subject to any fines or other sanctions related to these rules and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer any penalties or other consequences in the future.\nWe have become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nFederal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and defines \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% which results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amounts.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Specifically, First Bank Richmond\u2019s ability to pay dividends to Richmond Mutual Bancorporation will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may further limit Richmond Mutual Bancorporation\u2019s ability to pay dividends to stockholders. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u2212Federal Banking Regulation\u2212Capital Requirements\u201d contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nThe cost of additional finance and accounting systems, procedures, compliance and controls in order to satisfy our new public company reporting requirements will increase our expenses.\nWe recently became a public reporting company. We expect that the obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, will require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a stand-alone public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d) requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we would expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion. As a result, we may need to rely on outside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing this Form 10-K, as well as our other periodic reports that we are required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses and our determinations with respect to amounts owed for income taxes.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us.\nWe have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial costs and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities or properties we own.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties, or with respect to properties that we own in operating our business. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Our policies, which require us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on non-residential real property, may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or on terms acceptable to us.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We believe the net proceeds of our recent initial public offering will be sufficient to permit us to maintain regulatory compliance for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, we may elect to raise more capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. We cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, or if the terms of such a capital raise are not advantageous, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur.\nOur board of directors is authorized to allow us to issue additional common stock, as well as classes or series of preferred stock, generally without any action on the part of the stockholders. In addition, the board has the power, generally without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business and other terms. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market value of the common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company, and regulatory compliance may divert its attention from the day-to-day management of our business.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a publicly traded company or complying with the complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to a public company, which will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws. In particular, these new obligations will require substantial attention from our management team and may divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could materially and adversely impact our business operations.\nOur contribution to the charitable foundation may not be tax deductible, which could reduce our profits.\nWe may not have sufficient profits to be able to fully use the tax deduction from our contribution to our recently established charitable foundation. Under the Internal Revenue Code, an entity is permitted to deduct up to 10% of its taxable income (generally income before federal income taxes and charitable contributions expense) in any one year for charitable contributions. Any contribution in excess of the 10% limit may be deducted for federal income tax purposes over each of the five years following the year in which the charitable contribution is made. Accordingly, a charitable contribution could, if necessary, be deducted over a six-year period and expires thereafter.\nAs previously stated, we will incur a substantial expense in connection with the termination of First Bank Richmond\u2019s participation in the DB Plan, which will most likely eliminate all of our taxable income in 2020, resulting in us reporting a net tax loss for the year. As a result, we do not expect to be able to use any of the remaining charitable contribution carryover in 2020 from our 2019 contribution to the charitable foundation. There are no assurances that we will have sufficient profits in the future to be able to fully use the tax deduction from our contribution to the charitable foundation.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe capital we raised in our recent initial public offering may negatively impact our return on equity until we can fully implement our business plan. This could negatively affect the trading price of our shares of common stock.\nNet income divided by average equity, known as \u201creturn on equity,\u201d is a ratio many investors use to compare the performance of a financial institution to its peers. Although we anticipate increasing net interest income using proceeds of the offering, our return on equity will be reduced by the capital raised in our recent offering, higher expenses from the costs of being a public company, and added expenses associated with our adoption of an employee stock ownership plan and the other stock-based benefit plans we intend to adopt in the future. Until we can implement our business plan and increase our net interest income through investment of the proceeds of the offering, we expect our return on equity to remain relatively low compared to our peer group, which may reduce the value of our shares.\nThere may be a limited trading market in our common stock, which will hinder your ability to sell our common stock and may lower the market price of the stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cRMBI.\u201d The development of an active trading market depends on the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within our control, or that of any market maker. The number of active buyers and sellers of the shares of common stock at any particular time may be limited. Under such circumstances, you could have difficulty selling your shares of common stock on short notice, and, therefore, you should not view the shares of common stock as a short-term investment.\nOur stock-based and other benefit plans will increase our costs, which will reduce our net income.\nWe intend to adopt a new stock-based benefit plan during the 2020 fiscal year, subject to shareholder approval, which will increase our annual compensation and benefit expenses related to the stock options and stock awards granted to participants under the new stock-based benefit plan. The actual amount of these new stock-related compensation and benefit expenses will depend on the number of options and stock awards actually granted under the plan, the fair market value of our stock or options on the date of grant, the vesting period, and other factors that we cannot predict at this time.\nThe implementation of a stock-based benefit plan may dilute your ownership interest.\nWe intend to adopt a new stock-based benefit plan during the 2020 fiscal year. The stock-based benefit plan will be funded through either open market purchases, if permitted, or from the issuance of authorized but unissued shares. Our ability to repurchase shares of common stock to fund these plans will be subject to many factors, including applicable regulatory restrictions on common stock repurchases, the availability of stock in the market, the trading price of the stock, our capital levels, alternative uses for our capital and our financial\nperformance. While our intention is to fund the new stock-based benefit plan through open market purchases, stockholders would experience a reduction in ownership interest totaling 12.3% in the event newly issued shares are used to fund stock options and restricted stock awards in an amount equal to 10.0% and 4.0%, respectively, of the total shares issued in our recent initial public offering.\nYou may not receive dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The declaration and payment of future cash dividends will be subject to, among other things, regulatory restrictions, our then current and projected consolidated operating results, financial condition, tax considerations, future growth plans, general economic conditions, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation will depend primarily upon the proceeds it retains from the offering as well as earnings of First Bank Richmond to provide funds to pay dividends on our common stock. The payment of dividends by First Bank Richmond also is subject to certain regulatory restrictions. Federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be or continue to be undercapitalized, and dividends by a depository institution are subject to additional limitations. As a result, any payment of dividends in the future by Richmond Mutual Bancorporation will depend, in large part, on First Bank Richmond\u2019s ability to satisfy these regulatory restrictions and its earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors.", "PERMNO": 18851, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "RMBI"}
