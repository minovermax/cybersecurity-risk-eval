If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, then our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) a pandemic and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding the outbreak of COVID-19. In response to the resulting pandemic, governments around the world took various preventative measures in order to control the spread of the virus, including restricting travel, full or partial business shutdowns and implementing social distancing policies. As a result, we experienced a significant drop in orders, especially in the second quarter of 2020, and the global economy was plunged into a recession. Although business conditions in our markets had improved by late in the third quarter of that year, the effects of the pandemic have continued to negatively impact our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. The duration of these effects is uncertain and will likely be tied to the course of the pandemic. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its broader impact on the global economy, including the demand for automobiles, it is unknown what the impact of COVID-19 and its related effects will be on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but the impact could be material and last for an extended period of time.\nWe are dependent on the automotive industry.\nDemand for our products is directly related to conditions in the global automotive industry, which is highly cyclical and is affected by a variety of factors, including regulatory requirements, international trade policies, and consumer spending and preferences. The automotive industry is characterized by fierce competition and has undergone major restructuring in recent years. The impact of evolving technological changes, including a growing emphasis on electric vehicles, as well as any decline in the automotive industry, domestic or foreign, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition.\nWe compete with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. Price, quality and service are the primary elements of competition. Our competitors include a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources. Faced with intense international competition and pressure to reduce costs, many customers have expanded their sourcing of components worldwide. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that benefit from economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs and fewer regulatory burdens. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on sales to major customers.\nOur sales to three customers constituted approximately 36% of our consolidated revenues in 2021. Sales to TI Group Automotive Systems, LLC, Parker-Hannifin Corporation and Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. accounted for approximately 13%, 12% and 11% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2021, respectively. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks related to export sales.\nOur export sales have increased in recent years, and we are working to continue to expand our business relationships with customers outside of the United States. Export sales are subject to various risks, including risks related to changes in local economic, social and political conditions (particularly in emerging markets), changes in tariffs and trade policies and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in our raw material costs or difficulties with our suppliers could negatively affect us.\nWhile we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain raw materials. At various times in recent years, we have been adversely impacted by increased costs for steel, our principal raw material, which we have been unable to wholly mitigate, as well as increases in other materials prices. Any continued fluctuation in the price or availability of our raw materials could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSupply Chain Disruptions.\nMany of our customers depend upon intricate just-in-time supply chain systems. A disruption in a supply chain caused by one or more suppliers, and/or an unrelated supplier, due to part shortages, work stoppages, bankruptcy, raw material shortages, natural disasters, coronavirus, tariffs, etc. could adversely impact our business, or our customers\u2019 business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by labor relations issues.\nAlthough none of our employees are unionized, the domestic automakers and many of their suppliers, including many of our customers, have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by automakers or their suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures of assembly plants where our products are included in assembled components. In the event that one or more of our customers or their customers experiences a material labor relations issue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur losses as a result of product liability, warranty or other claims that may be brought against us.\nWe face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or result, or are alleged to have resulted, in bodily injury, property damage or other losses. In addition, if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, then we may be required to participate in a product recall. We may also be involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. Any losses or other liabilities related to these exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely impacted by environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Currently, environmental costs and liabilities with respect to our operations are not material, but there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by these costs and liabilities in the future either under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nWe could be adversely impacted by the loss of the services of key employees.\nSuccessful operations depend, in part, upon the efforts of executive officers and other key employees. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Loss of the services of any of our key employees, or the inability to attract or retain employees could have a material adverse affect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny significant disruption, interruption or failure of our information systems could disrupt the operation of our business, result in increased costs and decreased revenues and expose us to liability.\nCybersecurity threats are growing in number and sophistication and include, among others, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. In addition to security threats, we are also subject to other systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, natural disasters, power shortages, terrorist attacks or other events. The unavailability of our information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated or any significant breach of data security could cause loss of data, disrupt our operations, lead to financial losses from remedial actions, require significant management attention and resources, and negatively impact our reputation among our customers, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to volatility, and our stock is thinly-traded.\nVarious factors, such as general economic changes in the financial markets, announcements or significant developments with respect to the automotive industry, actual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors\u2019 quarterly or annual financial results, the introduction of new products or technologies by us or our competitors, changes in other conditions or trends in our industry or in the markets of any of our significant customers, changes in governmental regulation, or changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our competitors or our industry, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE American (not registered, trading privileges only). The average daily trading volume for our common stock during 2021 was less than 4,000 shares per day. As a result, you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock, and the price of our common stock may vary significantly based on trading volume.", "PERMNO": 30509, "SIC": 3452, "TIC": "CVR"}
