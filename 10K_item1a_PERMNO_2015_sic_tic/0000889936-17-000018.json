RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our securities. The risks discussed below are those that we believe are the most significant risks to our business plans and strategies and financial performance, although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. Before making a decision to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, many of which are larger credit relationships, including some that are leveraged loans. The repayment of such loans is largely dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower and the state of the economy.\nOur commercial loan portfolio, which includes commercial and industrial loans and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, totaled $9.6 billion, or 64% of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2016. The repayment of the commercial loans is largely dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower, which generally is impacted by the state of the overall economy, rather than through the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral. The collateral securing commercial loans, such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate specific to the borrower\u2019s use, may be difficult and costly to liquidate given its often unique nature. As a result, if a commercial loan defaults and we foreclose on the underlying collateral, we may not be able to recover the full principal amount of the loan, which would increase our credit costs.\nA portion of our commercial and industrial loans are leveraged loans, which are primarily underwritten on the basis of the recurring earnings of the borrower, and have a higher ratio of debt-to-earnings and lower collateral coverage as compared to commercial and industrial loans not characterized as leveraged. As a result, in the event of a default, the loss potential generally is greater for leveraged loans as compared to more traditional commercial and industrial loans with more collateral coverage.\nOver the past few years, the federal bank regulatory agencies have jointly issued updated supervisory guidance, and increased their examination focus, on leveraged lending by regulated institutions due to the significant growth in the volume of leveraged credit issued, developments in how some leveraged loans are structured and their desire to ensure risk management practices in the leveraged loan market keep pace with market developments. A majority of our leveraged loan portfolio are loans that are classified as \u201chigher-risk assets\u201d by the FDIC under its risk-based deposit insurance assessment framework. Refer to Table 13 in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d As we manage our overall risk appetite to adapt to market and economic conditions affecting the leveraged loan market, including reduced demand by the banking industry to participate in syndicated leveraged loan transactions, our future loan growth could be impacted.\nMany of our commercial loans involve larger relationships. We had 182 individual credit relationships with credit commitments exceeding $25 million, most of which are commercial loans, which totaled $6.2 billion of commitments and represented $3.6 billion of outstanding loans, or 24% of our loan portfolio, at December 31, 2016. The borrowers in some of these credit relationships may be related to other obligors as guarantors or share related ownership structures. Of our largest commitments, commitments exceeding $50 million represented $916.4 million in total commitments and $336.4 million of outstanding loans at December 31, 2016, compared to $688.3 million in total commitments and $232.1 million of outstanding loans at December 31, 2015. Because of their size relative to our overall loan portfolio, the unexpected occurrence of an adverse event or development affecting one or more of these large client relationships could materially affect our results of operation and financial condition, including by causing quarterly fluctuations in our credit costs and credit quality metrics.\nConsistent with our middle market commercial lending focus, we have several industry and product type concentrations within our loan portfolio. These particular industries and product types are subject to specific risks that could adversely affect our business.\nSeveral industry and product type concentrations within our loan portfolio are subject to specific risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations to the extent they have correlated risk. Some of these portfolio concentrations and their particular risks include the following:\n\u2022\nHealthcare - This is the largest industry classification within our commercial loan portfolio, as 21% of our commercial loan portfolio, or $2.0 billion, at December 31, 2016, consisted of healthcare-related loans. Such loans are comprised primarily of loans secured by skilled nursing and assisted living facilities that are dependent, in part, on the receipt of payments and reimbursements under government contracts for services provided. Accordingly, our clients and their ability to service debt may be adversely impacted by the financial health of state or federal payors and the ability of governmental entities, many of which have experienced budgetary stress in the recent economic environment, to make payments for services previously provided. Additionally, across the healthcare industry, structural changes to the government reimbursement model may negatively impact performance for managed care facilities as borrowers adapt to these changes, which could impact their ability to service debt. As of December 31, 2016, 53% of the healthcare portfolio was secured by facilities in five states, with Illinois representing the highest percentage of facilities at 23%.\n\u2022\nManufacturing - This is the second largest industry classification within our commercial loan portfolio, with 19% of our commercial loan portfolio, or $1.8 billion, at December 31, 2016 consisting of loans to borrowers whose primary business activity was manufacturing. During the second half of 2015 and into 2016, the U.S. manufacturing sector experienced a significant slowdown, as evidenced by declines or slowing rates of growth in a number of key indicators, due in part to\nthe economic headwinds of lower commodity prices (including oil and gas prices) and a strong U.S. dollar, with particular stress faced by durable goods manufacturing. Although the U.S. manufacturing sector began to rebound toward the end of 2016, the sector\u2019s performance may continue to experience volatility due to the impact of commodity prices, currency exchange rates, possible U.S. corporate tax reform, U.S. political developments and broader geopolitical developments on this sector. Any stress or volatility experienced by the U.S. manufacturing sector specifically could adversely impact our existing loan portfolio and/or our future loan growth rate.\n\u2022\nCommercial Real Estate - In addition to our large commercial loan portfolio, we have a significant commercial real estate portfolio, with $4.1 billion of commercial real estate loans (excluding construction loans) as of December 31, 2016, representing 27% of our total loan portfolio. The commercial real estate industry has exhibited strong performance over the past several years, but significant new development volume in recent years, particularly in certain asset classes such as multifamily, could place pressure on rents and vacancy rates, which could adversely impact borrowers\u2019 ability to service debt. Additionally, although commercial real estate values, and the net operating income generated by them, are influenced by the overall health of the U.S. economy, they also can be significantly impacted by other factors such as market interest rates, excess capacity or lack of supply of comparable properties in the particular market and global geopolitical events given the importance of foreign investor participation in U.S. real estate markets. If the value of commercial real estate were to decline materially due to the foregoing or other factors, a significant portion of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. If our commercial real estate loans were to become troubled during a time of depressed commercial real estate values, we may not be able to realize the value of the collateral that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could increase our credit costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business is dependent on ongoing access to sufficient and stable, cost-effective sources of liquidity.\nOur primary sources of funding are deposits and, to a lesser extent, Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) borrowings. We rely on these funding sources to provide sufficient liquidity to support our loan growth on a cost-effective basis while accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients. Our deposit base is primarily comprised of commercial clients and institutional depositors and relatively concentrated in large relationships, with our ten largest deposit relationships comprising 15% of total deposits at December 31, 2016. At year end 2016, we had 31 client relationships with greater than $75 million in deposit balances, which totaled $4.4 billion, or 27%, of total deposits. The unanticipated loss of one or more large deposit relationships, or significant movements in large deposit accounts, could stress our liquidity and possibly require us to utilize higher cost contingency funding sources. A majority of our large deposit relationships of $75 million or more come from financial services clients, such as securities broker-dealers for which we serve as a cash sweep program bank, hedge funds and fund administrators and futures commission merchants. Financial services clients have a higher propensity to generate large transactional flows, which contributes to liquidity risk, and some of these deposits, particularly from hedge funds, fund administrators and futures commission merchants, may exhibit elevated volatility and be more sensitive to financial stress as compared to other commercial deposits due to the more complex liquidity and cash flow needs of financial services clients given the nature of their businesses. Additionally, large commercial deposits may be more sensitive to interest rate increases as compared to smaller retail deposits, which could cause our deposit costs to increase more quickly in a rising rate environment than if we had a larger retail deposit base. Since the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, market expectations about future interest rate increases have changed significantly and the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points in December 2016. If market interest rates continue to increase, we could experience more competition for deposits, as money market funds and other liquid fixed income alternatives could become more attractive to commercial depositors relative to bank deposits. In such case, our net interest margin could be negatively impacted if we must pay more to continue attracting sufficient commercial deposits to fund our growth and/or increase our reliance on wholesale funding sources, such as FHLB borrowings. Furthermore, if we were to experience increased challenges in attracting and maintaining stable, cost-effective sources of liquidity, we may need to moderate our loan growth to adhere to prudent risk management objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings from the FHLB of $1.6 billion. Because we rely on FHLB borrowings to supplement our deposits, if we were unable to borrow additional amounts from the FHLB because of insufficient eligible collateral or other conditions, we would need to supplement our deposits with an alternate source of funds, which could increase our cost of funding and may not match our funding needs as well as FHLB borrowings.\nThe importance of stable sources of funding is heightened for a predominantly commercial banking business because of unfunded commitments extended to commercial clients. Our total unfunded commitments to extend credit, including obligations to issue letters of credit, were $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. Given the large size of many of our credit relationships, significant draws on outstanding commitments by a few clients may adversely impact our liquidity and require us to utilize higher cost contingency funding.\nA prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn in economic conditions, in the U.S. or globally, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBanking, and the financial industry in general, is reliant on the strength of the broader economy. Although the U.S. economy has experienced gradual improvement since the depths of the last recession in 2009, including significant improvement in the unemployment rate, there continue to be economic headwinds from muted GDP growth, limited wage growth, low inflation, and a strong U.S. dollar. Market conditions are also impacted by continued uncertainty related to U.S. and European fiscal issues, a slowdown in economic growth in China, the U.S. political climate at the national and local levels and the new U.S. Presidential administration, future U.S. corporate tax policy, global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions. In addition, the financial condition of the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago (higher corporate tax rates, significant budget deficits, large unfunded pension obligations and a deteriorating credit rating), where we do the majority of our business, may contribute to an adverse climate for doing business in the state and city, which could negatively impact us to the extent it leads to declines in business activity in Illinois and the greater Chicago metropolitan area. Although we do not hold direct obligations of the State of Illinois, such conditions can also negatively affect the market value of those municipal bonds that are obligations of municipalities domiciled in Illinois. The foregoing uncertainties could result in, among other things, a deterioration of credit quality, impairment of real estate and other collateral values or reduced demand for credit or other products and services we offer to clients, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nEvery loan we make carries a certain risk of non-payment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe credit risks posed by the particular borrower and loan type;\n\u2022\nthe duration and structure of the loan;\n\u2022\nin the case of a collateralized loan, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral;\n\u2022\nthe ability to identify potential repayment issues in loans at an early stage; and\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and industry conditions.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time. We determine the allowance using our historical default and loss information, current risk ratings for our loans and certain qualitative factors that are assessed by management. The application of qualitative factors, in particular, requires a significant amount of management judgment. We may incur aggregate losses on our loan portfolio that exceed, perhaps by a significant amount, the $185.8 million that we have reserved in the allowance at December 31, 2016, particularly if economic conditions were to materially worsen.\nBecause the predominantly commercial nature of our loan portfolio results in us having a greater number of larger credit relationships than many other banks of a generally comparable size, as evidenced by the fact that 24% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 was comprised of credit relationships in amounts exceeding $25 million, adverse developments with respect to even a small number of credit relationships could lead to a significant increase in our allowance for loan losses and related provision expense in a given period. The occurrence of an adverse rating migration for one or more large loans, particularly a leveraged loan, could require a meaningful increase in our allowance for loan losses and related provision expense under our allowance methodology. In light of the foregoing, we may experience significant variability in our quarterly provision expense and charge-offs and overall credit quality trends.\nWe may be adversely affected by the failure of interest rates to meaningfully increase from their prolonged historically low levels.\nOur operating results are largely dependent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. The spread between the yield on our interest-earning assets and our overall cost of funds has been compressed in the prolonged low interest rate environment, with our ability to increase contractual loan yields limited by continued strong competition in the lending market. Because we price loans primarily on a variable-rate basis (generally to LIBOR), we believe our balance sheet is well-positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment. However, it is more difficult to predict the impact of a rising interest rate environment on our cost of funds, as funding costs are significantly dependent on a number of factors outside of our control, such as client deposit behavior and deposit pricing pressure from competitors. Interest rates are affected by numerous factors, including monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and expectations regarding the same, and future interest rate levels are inherently difficult\nto predict. Although the Federal Reserve increased by the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points in December 2015 and again in December 2016, market interest rates still remain near historically low levels. There can be no assurances as to when or if the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates or the extent to which our net interest income will benefit if such increases occur.\nOver the past several years, the Federal Reserve implemented various significant economic strategies that impacted interest rates, inflation, and the shape of the yield curve and future actions or strategies could further impact such conditions, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOver the past several years, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary policy initiatives in response to economic conditions, including the purchase of U.S. treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities (commonly known as \u201cquantitative easing\u201d (\u201cQE\u201d)). Among other things, QE strategies were intended to create or maintain a low interest rate environment and stimulate economic activity, and have theoretically caused interest rates to remain lower than they would have been without such involvement. The Federal Reserve formally ended the QE program during the fourth quarter of 2014, but market interest rates nevertheless remain highly dependent on actions of the Federal Reserve and market participants\u2019 expectations about such actions. As discussed above, our net interest income is significantly dependent on the level of market interest rates given their impact on loan yields and deposit costs. More generally, market interest rates also influence many other elements of our business, such as asset management fees (as interest rates impact equity and fixed income values, which drive such fees), mortgage banking revenue (as interest rates impact the demand for mortgages and gains on sales to the secondary market), capital markets revenue (as interest rates, and expectations about future direction, impact client demand for interest rate derivatives and foreign currency volatility), syndication fees (as interest rates impact pricing and demand for syndicated loans), loan growth (as interest rates can impact the overall economy and, as a result, demand for new credit) and gains, losses and yields on our investment securities portfolio. Accordingly, actions by the Federal Reserve and market expectations about potential actions could adversely affect our operating results, including by creating volatility in such results.\nOur business could be significantly impacted if we, or our third party service providers, suffer failure, cyber-attack or disruptions of information systems, our employees cause an operational failure or our clients suffer losses due to fraudulent or negligent acts by their employees or third parties in connection with their banking transactions.\nWe rely heavily on communications, data processing and other information processing systems to conduct and support our business, many of which are provided through third-parties. If our third party providers encounter difficulties or become the source of an attack on or breach of their operational systems, data or infrastructure, or if we have difficulty communicating with any such third party system, our business operations could suffer. Any failure or disruption to our systems, or those of a third party provider, could impede our transaction processing, service delivery, customer relationship management, data processing, financial reporting or risk management. Our computer systems, software and networks, and those of our third party providers, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious code, or cyber-attacks that circumvent our prevention measures or are beyond what we can reasonably anticipate, and such events could result in material loss. Additionally, we could suffer disruptions to our systems or damage to our network infrastructure from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. Furthermore, in light of rapid technological advancements, we must continually mature our cybersecurity risk management program to address emerging risks. If significant failure, interruption or security breaches do occur in our processing systems or those of our third party providers, we could suffer significant damage to our reputation, a loss of customer business, additional regulatory scrutiny, or exposure to civil litigation, additional costs and possible financial liability.\nDue the nature of our business, we regularly process transfers of large amounts of money to and from our clients\u2019 accounts. To do so, we are dependent on the actions of our employees and instructions from our clients and, therefore, we are exposed to operational and fraud risks. We could be materially adversely affected from a financial or reputational perspective if our employees cause a significant operational failure that leads to significant client loss. Additionally, if our clients are victim to operational failure or fraud by their own employees or third parties relating to their accounts with us, we could suffer reputational harm and loss of business even if we have no liability for such failure or fraud.\nThe loss of one or more key employees or lending teams may adversely affect our business.\nWe are a relationship-driven organization. Our continued growth and development is dependent in large part upon the efforts of our key relationship managers who have primary contact with our clients and responsibility for maintaining personalized relationships with our client base. These personalized relationships are a key aspect of our business strategy. The loss of one or more of these key employees, or a lending team, could have a material adverse effect on our business if we are unable to hire\nsuitable replacements or we are unable to successfully retain the client relationships of departing employees. Uncertainty about the effect of the pending CIBC merger, or about the timing of closing the merger, could impact our ability to retain key employees during the pendency of the merger.\nWe have counterparty risk; the creditworthiness of other financial institutions could expose us to losses on contracts we have with these institutions and adversely affect our ability to provide services to our clients, specifically products and services relating to foreign exchange, interest rate derivatives and letters of credit.\nOur ability to provide certain products and services could be adversely affected by the actions and financial health of other banks. Banks are interrelated as a result of lending, clearing, correspondent, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more banks, or the banking industry generally, have in the past led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of the transactions engaged in by us in the ordinary course of business, particularly in our capital markets group, expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a financial institution counterparty. While we hold collateral in most such transactions, collateral may be insufficient to mitigate our losses, as we may be unable to realize or liquidate at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure. Such losses could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur capital markets group offers to clients a range of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives products. Although we do not engage in any proprietary trading and we structure these client-generated trading activities to mitigate our exposure to market risk, we remain exposed to various risks, the most significant of which is counterparty risk, which may be most significant in foreign exchange transactions where timing differences between settlement centers can result in us paying the counterparty before actually receiving the funds. In addition, for swaps we execute with counterparties to mitigate the market risk of our customer trades, we may be required to post collateral to secure our obligations related to those trades; if such a counterparty invokes the protection of insolvency laws, then the collateral posted to secure our obligations to that counterparty may be trapped with, and potentially subject to claims of creditors of, that counterparty.\nWe are highly regulated and may be adversely affected by a failure to comply with banking laws, regulations and regulatory expectations or changes in such laws, regulations and regulatory expectations.\nWe, like all banking organizations, are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination. This regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies to address not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing consumer protection, fair lending, privacy, information security and anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws), but also capital adequacy, asset quality, risk management, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. Under this structure, the regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine, among other things, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or regulations or are otherwise inconsistent with regulatory expectations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations. For example, regulatory scrutiny of compliance with consumer lending and protection laws and regulations has increased significantly over the past several years since the creation of the CFPB following enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly with respect to \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts or practices and alleged fair lending violations. A failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations or expectations of our regulators (including the CFPB) relating to safe and sound banking or compliance practices could result in regulatory sanctions, civil money penalties or other adverse actions against us, which in turn could increase our compliance burden and costs of doing business, restrict our ability to expand our business or result in damage to our reputation.\nChanges in laws, regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting the financial services industry, and the effects of such changes, are difficult to predict and may have unintended consequences. New regulations or changes in the regulatory environment could limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, the demand for existing products and services, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. We may incur increased costs related to additional staffing, professional services and information technology resources to support compliance or data collection and data analytics to satisfy evolving expectations for enhanced risk and liquidity management processes and new regulatory reporting requirements.\nSince the U.S. federal elections in November 2016, there has been significant discussion about future financial regulatory reform. For example, in February 2017, President Trump issued an executive order calling for the U.S. Treasury Secretary to consult with the federal banking agencies and deliver a report on how existing financial regulation aligns with core principles articulated in the order to guide regulatory reform. Additionally, the Financial CHOICE Act has been introduced in the House Financial Services Committee, which would make intricate changes to the Dodd-Frank Act, such as provide a Dodd-Frank off-ramp for highly-rated banking organizations that satisfy a heightened leverage ratio requirement, repeal the Volcker Rule and Durbin Amendment, revamp\nthe CFPB and eliminate or substantially modify the federal banking agencies\u2019 authority to exercise extraordinary powers in financial crises. At this time, it is uncertain whether or to what extent the executive order or proposed legislation such as the Financial CHOICE Act will result in any material changes to current financial industry laws and regulations and, if so, to what extent such changes would impact the Company, or the competitive landscape in the banking and broader financial services industry.\nChanges in taxes and other assessments may significantly impact us and our clients.\nThe legislatures and administrations in the U.S. and state and local tax jurisdictions in which we operate regularly enact reforms to the tax and other assessment regimes to which we and our clients are subject. Such reforms include changes in the rate of assessments and, occasionally, enactment of temporary taxes. Any change in tax law, such as proposed changes to the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate that has been discussed by Congress and the new U.S. Presidential administration, the current tax depreciation system and the deductibility of interest expense, or any other change made in connection with any comprehensive U.S. federal tax reform, may affect our tax position and the tax position and financial performance of our clients. The effects of these changes and any other changes that result from enactment of potential tax reforms cannot be quantified and there can be no assurance that any such reforms would not have an adverse effect upon our financial performance or our business, in part due to the impact on our clients. For example, if U.S. federal tax reform included a reduction in the deductibility of interest expense, that could impact the cash flow of our borrowers. Although a reduction in the statutory U.S. federal corporate rate may lower our tax provision expense in future periods, it may also significantly decrease the value of our deferred tax asset which would result in a reduction of net income in the period in which the tax change is enacted.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe conduct business in the highly competitive financial services industry, which has been and continues to be impacted by significant and increasing government regulation, increasing technological demands and disruption and the presence of many new non-bank competitors. Our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this environment. With respect to our Commercial Banking business, we compete primarily with super-regional and national commercial banks, asset-based non-bank lenders and commercial mortgage banking companies. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources, lending limits and larger office and branch networks, and greater access to lower cost deposits and capital, than we do and therefore may be able to compete more effectively on loan pricing or terms and/or offer products and services beyond what we offer. In recent years, in which credit costs and interest rates have been low, we have experienced significant competitive pressure in pricing and structuring loans in certain of our loan segments. Because we generate earnings primarily from the difference between the interest earned on loans and the interest we pay on deposits, this pricing pressure has impacted, and is expected to continue impacting, our margins.\nRemaining competitive will require ongoing investments in technology to satisfy expectations of our clients, enhance service delivery, support new products and services and efficiently grow our business. Additionally, increasing our retail deposit gathering capabilities in a competitive environment may require significant investments by us, such as by enhancing digital strategies, opening new branches or acquiring retail deposit franchises, which also could impact our results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to the Merger\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees and clients may have an adverse effect on the Company and, consequently, the surviving corporation. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause clients and others that deal with us to seek to change our existing business relationships. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to uncertainty about the timing of closing the merger, the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, our business prior to the merger (and CIBC\u2019s business following the merger) could be negatively impacted. In addition, until the merger occurs, the merger agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions or entering into new lines of business, entering into or modifying material contracts and taking other specified actions without the consent of CIBC. These restrictions may prevent or delay us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger. The merger agreement also restricts us from increasing our dividend prior to the merger.\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include, among others, the approval of the merger proposal by our stockholders, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals (which include approvals of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada), the Federal Reserve Board and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation) and expiration or termination of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof, the accuracy of representations and warranties under the merger agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement), CIBC\u2019s and the Company\u2019s performance of their respective obligations under the merger agreement in all material respects and each of CIBC\u2019s and the Company\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the merger will be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed by June 29, 2017, either CIBC or the Company may choose not to proceed with the merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after our stockholder approval has been obtained. In addition, CIBC and the Company may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $150 million to CIBC.\nFailure to complete the merger at all, or a material delay in completing the merger, could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders declining to approve the merger agreement or the failure of the parties to obtain the required regulatory approvals, or if we and CIBC experience a material delay in completing the merger, our stock price and ongoing business may be adversely affected. In such case, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets;\n\u2022\nour stock price, as well as the prices for our publicly-traded debt securities, could be materially impacted due to changing expectations from market participants about the timing or likelihood of completion of the merger and our future prospects;\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from our clients, employees and/or vendors, and if there is a material delay in completing the merger, we may find it more challenging to retain our clients and key employees due to the perceived uncertainty about the transaction;\n\u2022\nwe will have incurred substantial transaction-related expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed;\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the merger and such restrictions (the waiver of which is subject to the reasonable consent of CIBC) may prevent or delay us from making certain acquisitions or entering into new lines of business, entering into or modifying material contracts and taking other specified actions without the consent of CIBC during the pendency of the merger;\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the merger (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company; and\n\u2022\nduring the pendency of the merger, our stock price is likely to be impacted by factors affecting CIBC\u2019s ongoing business, prospects and stock price because a majority of the merger consideration is in the form of CIBC common shares; the longer period of time that the merger is pending, the more our stockholders (including employee stockholders) may be exposed to fluctuations in the price of CIBC common shares, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition to the above risks, if the merger agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration CIBC has agreed to provide in the merger.", "PERMNO": 87020, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PVTB"}
