{"cik": "314808", "company": "Ensco plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of significant factors that might cause our future operating results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not specified herein, not currently known to us or currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, operating results and/or cash flows.\nThe success of our business largely depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which can be significantly affected by volatile oil and natural gas prices.\nBrent crude oil prices have fallen during the last five months, from $95 per barrel to $60 per barrel on February 23, 2015. Operators have announced significant declines in capital spending in their 2015 budgets, including the cancellation or deferral of existing programs. These declines in capital spending levels, coupled with additional newbuild supply, have put significant pressure on day rates and utilization. The success of our business largely depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, may continue to significantly affect the level of drilling activity. The decline, or the perceived risk of a further decline, in oil and/or natural gas prices could cause oil and gas companies to further reduce their overall level of activity or spending, in which case demand for our services may further decline and revenues may continue to be adversely affected through lower rig utilization and/or lower day rates. Numerous factors may affect oil and natural gas prices and the level of demand for our services, including:\n\u2022\noil and natural gas supply and demand,\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding future energy prices,\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") to set and maintain production levels and pricing,\n\u2022\ncapital allocation decisions by our customers, including the relative economics of offshore development versus onshore prospects,\n\u2022\nthe level of production by non-OPEC countries,\n\u2022\nU.S. and non-U.S. tax policy,\n\u2022\nlaws and government regulations that limit, restrict or prohibit exploration and development of oil and natural gas in various jurisdictions, or materially increase the cost of such exploration and development,\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration and development technology,\n\u2022\ndisruption to exploration and development activities due to hurricanes and other severe weather conditions and the risk thereof,\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas,\n\u2022\nrate of discovery of new reserves,\n\u2022\nlocal and international political, economic and weather conditions,\n\u2022\nthe development and exploitation of alternative fuels,\n\u2022\nthe worldwide military or political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in oil or natural gas producing areas of the Middle East or geographic areas in which we operate, or acts of terrorism, and\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions.\nAny prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the levels of exploration, development and production activity. In addition, continued hostilities in foreign countries and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks against the United States or other countries could create downward pressure on the economies of the United States and other countries. Moreover, even during periods of high commodity prices, customers may cancel or curtail their drilling programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, including their lack of success in exploration efforts. Advances in onshore exploration and development technologies, particularly with respect to onshore shale plays, could result in our customers allocating more of their capital expenditure budgets to onshore exploration and production activities and less to offshore activities. These factors could cause our revenues and margins to decline, as a result of declines in utilization and day rates, and limit our future growth prospects. Any significant decrease in day rates or utilization of our rigs, particularly our high-specification floaters, could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate or are otherwise required by our contracts.\nDeterioration of the global economy and/or a continued decline in oil and natural gas prices could cause our customers to reduce spending on exploration and development drilling. These conditions also could cause our customers and/or vendors to fail to fulfill their commitments and/or fund their future operations and obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe success of our business largely depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development drilling worldwide. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in these prices, significantly impact the level of worldwide drilling activity.\nA continued decline in oil and natural gas prices, whether caused by OPEC, economic conditions, international or national climate change and/or environmental regulations or other factors, could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of drilling activity and spending. Disruption in the capital markets could also cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of drilling activity and spending. These conditions could cause our customers and vendors to fail to fulfill their commitments to us.\nHistorically, when drilling activity and spending decline, utilization and day rates also decline and drilling may be reduced or discontinued, resulting in an oversupply of drilling rigs. The oversupply of drilling rigs will be exacerbated by the entry of newbuild rigs into the market. When idled or stacked, drilling rigs do not earn revenues, but continue to require cash expenditures for crews, fuel, insurance, berthing and associated items.\nA further decline in oil and natural gas prices, together with a deterioration of the global economy, could substantially reduce demand for drilling rigs and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nThe offshore contract drilling industry historically has been highly competitive and cyclical, with periods of low demand and excess rig availability that could result in adverse effects on our business.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Pricing, safety records and competency are key factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Rig availability, location and technical capabilities also can be significant factors in the determination. In addition, consolidations within the oil and gas industry have reduced the number of available customers, resulting in increased competition for projects. If we are not able to compete successfully, our revenues and profitability may be reduced.\nFinancial operating results in the offshore contract drilling industry historically have been very cyclical and are primarily related to the demand for drilling rigs and the available supply of drilling rigs. Demand for rigs is directly related to the regional and worldwide levels of offshore exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies, which is beyond our control. Offshore exploration and development spending may fluctuate substantially from year-to-year and from region-to-region.\nThe supply of offshore drilling rigs has increased in recent years. There are 200 newbuild drillships, semisubmersibles and jackup rigs reported to be on order or under construction with delivery expected by the end of 2020. Approximately 90 of these rigs are scheduled for delivery during 2015, representing an approximate 11% increase in the total worldwide fleet of offshore drilling rigs. There are no assurances that the market in general or a geographic region in particular will be able to fully absorb the supply of new rigs in future periods.\nThe increase in supply of offshore drilling rigs during 2014 and early 2015 resulted in an oversupply of offshore drilling rigs and a decline in utilization and/or day rates, a situation which, if it persists for the next few years, could be exacerbated by a prolonged decline in demand for drilling rigs. Lower utilization and/or day rates in one or more of the regions in which we operate could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nCertain events, such as limited availability or non-availability of insurance for certain perils in some geographic areas, rig loss or damage due to hurricanes, blowouts, craterings, punchthroughs and other operational events, may also impact the supply of rigs in a particular market and cause rapid fluctuations in utilization and day rates.\nFuture periods of reduced demand and/or excess rig supply may require us to idle additional rigs or enter into lower day rate contracts or contracts with less favorable terms. There can be no assurance that the current demand for drilling rigs will not decline in future periods. A decline in demand for drilling rigs or an oversupply of drilling rigs could adversely affect our financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to secure contracts on economically favorable terms.\nOur ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new contracts and the terms of any such contracts will depend on market conditions. We may be unable to renew our expiring contracts or obtain new contracts for the rigs under contracts that have expired or been terminated, and the day rates under any new contracts may be substantially below the existing day rates, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur customers may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual commitments to us, including their obligations to pay for losses, damages or other liabilities resulting from operations under the contract.\nCertain of our customers are subject to liquidity risk and such risk could lead them to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate our drilling contracts for various reasons. Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers, including with respect to well control and subsurface risks. Our drilling contracts also provide for varying levels of indemnification and allocation of liabilities between our customers and us with respect to loss or damage to property and injury or death to persons arising from the drilling operations we perform. Under our drilling contracts, liability with respect to personnel and property customarily is generally allocated so that we and our customers each assume liability for our respective personnel and property. Our customers typically assume most of the responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss, damage or other liability resulting from pollution or contamination, including clean-up and removal, third-party damages, and fines and penalties arising from operations\nunder the contract when the source of the pollution originates from the well or reservoir, including those resulting from blow-outs or cratering of the well. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to assume their responsibility, or honor their indemnity to us, for such losses. In addition, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, such indemnities are not enforceable if the cause of the damage was our gross negligence or willful misconduct. This could result in our having to assume liabilities not otherwise contemplated in our contracts due to customer balance sheet or liquidity issues.\nWe may suffer losses if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our contracts, if operations are suspended or interrupted or if a rig becomes a total loss.\nOur drilling contracts often are subject to termination without cause upon notice by the customer. Although contracts may require the customer to pay an early termination payment in the event of a termination for convenience (without cause), such payment may not fully compensate for the loss of the contract, and some of our contracts permit termination by the customer without an early termination payment. In periods of rapid market downturn similar to the current environment, our customers may not be able to honor the terms of existing contracts (including contracts for new rigs under construction), may terminate contracts even where there may be onerous termination fees, or may seek to renegotiate contract day rates and terms in light of depressed market conditions.\nDrilling contracts customarily specify automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer in the event of a total loss of the drilling rig and often include provisions addressing termination rights or reduction or cessation of day rates if operations are suspended or interrupted for extended periods due to breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, \"force majeure\" events beyond the control of either party or other specified conditions.\nIf a customer cancels a contract or if we elect to terminate a contract due to the customer\u2019s nonperformance and, in either case, we are unable to secure a new contract on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if a contract is disputed or suspended for an extended period of time or renegotiated, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of a significant customer could adversely affect us.\nWe provide our services to major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies. During 2014, our five largest customers accounted for 49% of our consolidated revenues in the aggregate, with our largest customer representing 16% of our consolidated revenues. Our financial position, operating results and cash flows may be materially adversely affected if a major customer terminates its contracts with us, fails to renew its existing contracts with us, requires renegotiation of our contracts or declines to award new contracts to us.\nOur current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our contract backlog was approximately $9.7 billion. This amount reflects the remaining contractual terms multiplied by the applicable contractual day rate. The contractual revenue may be higher than the actual revenue we receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations. Several factors could cause rig downtime or a suspension of operations, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nbreakdowns of equipment;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, including labor strikes;\n\u2022\nshortages of material and skilled labor;\n\u2022\nsurveys by government and maritime authorities;\n\u2022\nperiodic classification surveys;\n\u2022\nsevere weather, strong ocean currents or harsh operating conditions;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases or any government response to such occurrence or threat;\n\u2022\nthe early termination of contracts; and\n\u2022\nforce majeure events.\nLiquidity issues could lead our customers to go into bankruptcy or could encourage our customers to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate our drilling contracts for various reasons. Some of our drilling contracts permit early termination of the contract by the customer for convenience (without cause), generally exercisable upon advance notice to us and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us. There can be no assurances that our customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us.\nThe recent decline in oil prices, the perceived risk of a further decline in oil prices, and the resulting downward pressure on utilization is causing some customers to consider early termination of select contracts despite having to pay onerous early termination fees in some cases. We are currently in discussions with some of our customers regarding these issues. Customers may request to re-negotiate the terms of existing contracts, or they may request early termination in some circumstances. Therefore, revenues recorded in future periods could differ materially from our current backlog. Our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may have difficulty obtaining or maintaining insurance in the future on terms we find acceptable and our insurance coverage may not protect us against all of the risks and hazards we face, including those specific to offshore operations.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the offshore drilling industry, such as blow-outs, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, uncontrolled formation pressures, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment failures and mechanical breakdowns, punchthroughs, craterings, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, oil spills and pollution. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations and contract terminations. Our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations. Additionally, a security breach of our information systems or other technological failure could lead to a material disruption of our operations, information systems, and/or loss of business information, which could result in an adverse impact to our business. Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers, including with respect to well control and subsurface risks. We also maintain insurance for personal injuries, damage to or loss of equipment and other insurance coverage for various business risks.\nWe generally identify the operational hazards for which we will procure insurance coverage based on the likelihood of loss, the potential magnitude of loss, the cost of coverage, the requirements of our customer contracts and applicable legal requirements. Although we maintain what we believe to be an appropriate level of insurance covering hazards and risks we currently encounter during our operations, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain insurance against all potential risks and hazards.\nFurthermore, our insurance carriers may interpret our insurance policies such that they do not cover losses for which we make claims. Our insurance policies may also have exclusions of coverage for some losses. Uninsured exposures may include radiation hazards, certain loss or damage to property onboard our rigs and losses relating to shore-based terrorist acts or strikes.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain adequate insurance at rates and with deductibles or retention amounts that we consider commercially reasonable, we may choose to forgo insurance coverage and retain the associated risk of loss or damage.\nIf a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe potential for U.S. Gulf of Mexico hurricane related windstorm damage or liabilities could result in uninsured losses and may cause us to alter our operating procedures during hurricane season, which could adversely affect our business.\nCertain areas in and near the U.S. Gulf of Mexico experience hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis. Some of our drilling rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are located in areas that could cause them to be susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these storms, and we have a larger concentration of jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico than most of our competitors. We currently have eight jackup rigs and nine floaters in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could result in rig loss or damage, termination of drilling contracts for lost or severely damaged rigs or curtailment of operations on damaged drilling rigs with reduced or suspended day rates for significant periods of time until the damage can be repaired. Moreover, even if our drilling rigs are not directly damaged by such storms, we may experience disruptions in our operations due to damage to our customers' platforms and other related facilities in the area. Our drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been impacted by hurricanes, including the total loss of one jackup rig during 2004, one platform rig during 2005 and two jackup rigs during 2008, with associated losses of contract revenues and potential liabilities.\nInsurance companies incurred substantial losses in the offshore drilling, exploration and production industries as a consequence of hurricanes that occurred in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2004, 2005 and 2008. Accordingly, insurance companies have substantially reduced the nature and amount of insurance coverage available for losses arising from named tropical storm or hurricane damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (\"windstorm damage\") and have dramatically increased the cost of available windstorm coverage. The tight insurance market not only applies to coverage related to U.S. Gulf of Mexico windstorm damage or loss of our drilling rigs, but also impacts coverage for any potential liabilities to third parties associated with property damage, personal injury or death and environmental liabilities, as well as coverage for removal of wreckage and debris associated with hurricane losses. We have no assurance that the tight insurance market for windstorm damage, liabilities and removal of wreckage and debris will not continue into the foreseeable future.\nWe decided not to purchase windstorm insurance for hull and machinery losses to our floaters arising from windstorm damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico upon renewal of our annual insurance policies effective May 31, 2014, due to the significant premium, high deductible and limited coverage for windstorm damage. We opted out of windstorm insurance for our jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during 2009 and have not since renewed that insurance. We believe it is no longer customary for drilling contractors with similar size and fleet composition to purchase windstorm insurance for rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, for the aforementioned reasons. Accordingly, we have retained the risk of loss or damage for our eight jackup rigs and our nine floaters arising from windstorm damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nWe have established operational procedures designed to mitigate risk to our jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. In addition to procedures designed to better secure the drilling package on jackup rigs, improve jackup leg stability and increase the air gap to position the hull above waves, our procedures involve analysis of prospective drilling locations, which may include enhanced bottom surveys. These procedures may result in a decision to decline to operate on a customer-designated location during hurricane season notwithstanding that the location, water depth and other standard operating conditions are within a rig's normal operating range. Our procedures and the associated regulatory requirements addressing Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season, coupled with our decision to retain (self-insure) certain windstorm-related risks, may result in a significant reduction in the utilization of our jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nOur annual insurance policies are up for renewal effective May 31, 2015, and any retained exposures for property loss or damage and wreckage and debris removal or other liabilities associated with U.S. Gulf of Mexico tropical storms or hurricanes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash\nflows if we sustain significant uninsured or underinsured losses or liabilities as a result of U.S. Gulf of Mexico tropical storms or hurricanes.\nWe may incur asset impairments as a result of future declines in demand for offshore drilling rigs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a pre-tax, non cash loss on impairment of long-lived assets of $2,463.1 million, of which $1,220.8 million was included in (loss) income from continuing operations and $1,242.3 million was included in (loss) income from discontinued operations, net in our consolidated statement of operations. See \"Note 3 - Property and Equipment\" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our property and equipment. As of December 31, 2014, the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled $12.5 billion, which represented 78% of our total assets.\nWe evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment, primarily our drilling rigs, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such rigs may not be recoverable. The offshore drilling industry historically has been highly cyclical, and it is not unusual for rigs to be unutilized or underutilized for significant periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles change. Likewise, during periods of supply and demand imbalance, rigs are frequently contracted at or near cash break-even rates for extended periods of time until day rates increase when the supply/demand balance is restored. However, if the global economy were to deteriorate and/or the offshore drilling industry were to incur a significant prolonged downturn, additional impairment charges may occur with respect to specific individual rigs, groups of rigs, such as a specific type of drilling rig, or rigs in a certain geographic location.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $3.0 billion non-cash loss on impairment of our Floaters reporting unit goodwill. See \"Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities\" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our goodwill. As of December 31, 2014, the carrying value of our goodwill totaled $276.1 million, which represented 2% of total assets.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting units, perform a qualitative assessment of the likelihood that a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, and in certain circumstances estimate each reporting unit's fair value as of the testing date. In most instances, our calculation of the fair value of our reporting units is based on estimates of future discounted cash flows to be generated by our drilling rigs, which reflect management's judgments and assumptions regarding the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, as well as future industry conditions and operations, including expected utilization, day rates, expense levels, capital requirements and terminal values for each of our rigs. If the aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeds our market capitalization, we evaluate the reasonableness of the implied control premium. If we determine the implied control premium is not reasonable, we adjust the discount rate or other assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model and reduce the estimated fair values of our reporting units.\nIf the global economy deteriorates and/or our expectations relative to future offshore drilling industry conditions decline, our expectations of future cash flows may decline and could ultimately result in additional goodwill impairment. Additionally, a significant decline in the market value of our shares could result in additional goodwill impairment.\nOur non-U.S. operations involve additional risks not associated with U.S. operations.\nRevenues from non-U.S. operations were 62%, 61% and 65% of our total revenues during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our non-U.S. operations and shipyard rig construction and enhancement projects are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nterrorist acts, war and civil disturbances,\n\u2022\nexpropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our equipment,\n\u2022\nexpropriation or nationalization of a customer's property or drilling rights,\n\u2022\nrepudiation or nationalization of contracts,\n\u2022\nassaults on property or personnel,\n\u2022\npiracy, kidnapping and extortion demands,\n\u2022\nsignificant governmental influence over many aspects of local economies,\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in law and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws,\n\u2022\nwork stoppages, often due to strikes over which we have little or no control,\n\u2022\ncomplications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations,\n\u2022\nlimitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas,\n\u2022\nimposition of trade barriers,\n\u2022\nwage and price controls,\n\u2022\nimport-export quotas,\n\u2022\nexchange restrictions,\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations,\n\u2022\nchanges in monetary policies,\n\u2022\nuncertainty or instability resulting from hostilities or other crises in the Middle East, West Africa, Latin America or other geographic areas in which we operate,\n\u2022\nchanges in the manner or rate of taxation,\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to recover amounts due,\n\u2022\nincreased risk of government and vendor/supplier corruption,\n\u2022\nincreased local content requirements,\n\u2022\nthe occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases or any government response to such occurrence or threat;\n\u2022\nchanges in political conditions, and\n\u2022\nother forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control.\nWe historically have maintained insurance coverage and obtained contractual indemnities that protect us from some, but not all, of the risks associated with our non-U.S. operations such as nationalization, deprivation, confiscation, political and war risks. However, there can be no assurance that any particular type of contractual or insurance protection will be available in the future or that we will be able to purchase our desired level of insurance coverage at commercially feasible rates. Moreover, we may initiate a self-insurance program through one or more captive insurance subsidiaries. In circumstances where we have insurance protection for some or all of the risks associated with non-U.S. operations, such insurance may be subject to cancellation on short notice, and it is unlikely that we would be able to remove our rig or rigs from the affected area within the notice period. Accordingly, a significant event for which we are uninsured, underinsured or self-insured, or for which we have not received an enforceable contractual indemnity from a customer, could cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various tax laws and regulations in substantially all countries in which we operate or have a legal presence. We evaluate applicable tax laws and employ various business structures and operating strategies to\nobtain the optimal level of taxation on our revenues, income, assets and personnel. Actions by tax authorities that impact our business structures and operating strategies, such as changes to tax treaties, laws and regulations, or the interpretation or repeal of any of the foregoing, changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities, adverse rulings in connection with audits or otherwise, or other challenges may substantially increase our tax expense.\nAs required by law, we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various revenue agencies within the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of existing or future tax assessments.\nOur non-U.S. operations also face the risk of fluctuating currency values, which may impact our revenues, operating costs and capital expenditures. We currently conduct contract drilling operations in certain countries that have experienced substantial fluctuations in the value of their currency compared to the U.S. dollar. In addition, some of the countries in which we operate have occasionally enacted exchange controls. Generally, we have contractually mitigated these risks by invoicing and receiving payment in U.S. dollars (our functional currency) or freely convertible currency and, to the extent possible, by limiting our acceptance of foreign currency to amounts which approximate our expenditure requirements in such currencies. However, not all of our contracts contain these terms and there is no assurance that our contracts will contain such terms in the future.\nA portion of the costs and expenditures incurred by our non-U.S. operations, including a portion of the construction payments for new rigs, are settled in local currencies, exposing us to risks associated with fluctuation in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce this exposure in certain cases.. However, a relative weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the local currencies in these countries may increase our costs and expenditures.\nOur non-U.S. operations are also subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the operation of drilling rigs and the requirements for equipment. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to operate in such countries, which may not be reimbursed by our customers. Governments in some non-U.S. countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of oil, natural gas and mineral concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration of oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry in their countries. In addition, government action, including initiatives by OPEC, may continue to cause oil and/or natural gas price volatility. In some areas of the world, government activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work performed by major international oil companies and may continue to do so. Moreover, certain countries accord preferential treatment to local contractors or joint ventures or impose specific quotas for local goods and services, which can increase our operational costs and place us at a competitive disadvantage. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or activities will not have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by specific customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export and re-export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments also may impose express or de facto economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities.\nThe laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations. Shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations also could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.\nOur employees, contractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nRig construction, upgrade and enhancement projects are subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The risks are concentrated because our three ultra-deepwater drillships currently under construction are at a single shipyard in South Korea and our four jackup rigs currently under construction are at two shipyards in Dubai and Singapore.\nThere are 200 new offshore drilling rigs reported to be on order or under construction with expected delivery dates through 2020. As a result, shipyards and third-party equipment vendors are under significant resource constraints to meet delivery obligations. Such constraints may lead to substantial delivery and commissioning delays and/or equipment failures and/or quality deficiencies. Furthermore, new drilling rigs may face start-up or other operational complications following completion of construction work or other unexpected difficulties including equipment failures, design or engineering problems that could result in significant downtime at reduced or zero day rates or the cancellation or termination of drilling contracts.\nWe currently have three ultra-deepwater drillships and four jackup rigs under construction. In addition, we may construct additional rigs and continue to upgrade the capability and extend the service lives of our existing rigs. Some of these expenditures are unplanned.\nRig construction, upgrade, life extension and repair projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards,\n\u2022\ndelays in equipment deliveries or shipyard construction,\n\u2022\nshortages of materials or skilled labor,\n\u2022\ndamage to shipyard facilities or construction work in progress, including damage resulting from fire, explosion, flooding, severe weather, terrorism, war or other armed hostilities,\n\u2022\nunforeseen design or engineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment,\n\u2022\nunanticipated actual or purported change orders,\n\u2022\nstrikes, labor disputes or work stoppages,\n\u2022\nfinancial or operating difficulties of equipment vendors or the shipyard while constructing, enhancing, upgrading, improving or repairing a rig or rigs,\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases,\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting overall cost,\n\u2022\ninability to obtain the requisite permits or approvals,\n\u2022\nclient acceptance delays,\n\u2022\ndisputes with shipyards and suppliers,\n\u2022\nlatent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions,\n\u2022\nclaims of force majeure events, and\n\u2022\nadditional risks inherent to shipyard projects in a non-U.S. location.\nOur risks are concentrated because our seven rigs currently under construction are at three shipyards.\nTwo of our seven rigs currently under construction, ENSCO DS-8 and ENSCO DS-9, have secured drilling contracts upon completion of construction and are scheduled to be delivered during the first half of 2015. ENSCO DS-10, ENSCO 110, ENSCO 123, ENSCO 140 and ENSCO 141 are scheduled to be delivered beginning in the first half of 2015 through the second half of 2016. There is no assurance that we will secure drilling contracts for these rigs, or future rigs we construct, or that the drilling contracts we may be able to secure will be based upon rates and terms that will provide a reasonable rate of return on these investments. Our failure to secure contractual commitments for these rigs at rates and terms that result in a reasonable return upon completion of construction may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. With respect to our rigs under construction, we are subject to the risk of delays and other hazards that could impact the viability of the contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nOur drilling contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in drilling contracts with non-governmental customers.\nWe currently own and operate 16 rigs and manage four rigs contracted with national oil companies. The terms of these contracts are often non-negotiable and may expose us to greater commercial, political and operational risks than we assume in other contracts, such as exposure to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, under certain conditions that may not provide us an early termination payment, collection risks and political risks. We can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have an adverse impact on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs contracted to national oil companies with commensurate additional contractual risks.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings could affect us adversely.\nWe are involved in litigation, including various claims, disputes and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, many of which are uninsured and relate to intellectual property, commercial, operational, employment, regulatory, or other activities.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption and are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") regulations, the U.K. Bribery Act (\"UKBA\"), other U.S. laws and regulations governing our international operations and similar laws in other countries.\nIn 2010, Pride and its subsidiaries resolved with the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and the SEC their previously disclosed investigations into potential violations of the FCPA. However, Pride has received preliminary inquiries from governmental authorities of certain of the countries referenced in its settlements with the DOJ and SEC. We could face additional fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in these and other relevant jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of our rigs or other assets. At this stage of such inquiries, we are unable to determine what, if any, legal liability may result. Our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests. We could also face other third-party claims by directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, attorneys, agents, stockholders, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of our Company. In addition, disclosure of the subject matter of the investigations and settlements could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients, to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets.\nAny violation of the FCPA, OFAC regulations, the UKBA or other applicable anti-corruption laws, by us, our affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents could result in substantial fines, sanctions,\ncivil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or our availability of funds under our revolving credit facility. Further, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.\nIncreasing regulatory complexity could adversely impact the costs associated with our offshore drilling operations.\nIncreases in regulatory requirements, particularly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, could significantly increase our costs. In recent years, we have seen several significant regulatory changes that have affected the way we operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008 caused damage to a number of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Rigs that were moved off location by the storms damaged platforms, pipelines, wellheads and other drilling rigs. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (\"BOEMRE\"), and one of its successor agencies, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (\"BSEE\"), have issued guidelines for jackup rig fitness requirements during hurricane seasons, which have been in effect through November 2014. As a result of these BOEMRE guidelines, jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are required to operate with a higher air gap (the space between the water level and the bottom of the rig's hull) during hurricane season, effectively reducing the water depth in which they can operate. The guidelines also provide for enhanced information and data requirements from oil and gas companies operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. BSEE may take other steps that could increase the cost of operations or reduce the area of operations. Implementation of BSEE guidelines and regulations may subject us to increased costs and limit the operational capabilities of our rigs.\nSimilarly, as a result of the Macondo well incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued Notices to Lessees (\u201cNTLs\"), implementing new regulations applicable to drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Current or future NTLs or other rules, directives and regulations may further impact our customers' ability to obtain permits and commence or continue deep or shallow water operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Future legislative or regulatory enactments may impose new requirements for well control and blowout prevention equipment that could increase our costs and cause delays in our operations due to unavailability of associated equipment.\nAlso as a result of the Macondo well incident, BOEMRE and BSEE have promulgated regulations regarding safety and environmental management systems (\"SEMS\"). In 2013, BSEE adopted a final rule modifying the SEMS requirements. Although the SEMS requirements are directed primarily at operators, they have an indirect impact on contractors, including requirements for personnel training, written safe work practices and written agreements with operators regarding the application of the operators' and contractors' safety and environmental policies at the worksite. In addition, BSEE has stated that it is considering requiring contractors to have their own SEMS programs and that it might address that possibility in future rulemaking. The current SEMS regulations and the possibility of additional SEMS rules for contractors could expose us to increased costs.\nIn 2012, BSEE also issued an interim policy document for use by BSEE inspectors in issuing incidents of noncompliance (\u201cINCs\u201d) to contractors conducting operations under BSEE jurisdiction on the Outer Continental Shelf of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The stated purpose of the policy is to provide for consistency in application of BSEE enforcement authority by establishing guidelines for issuance of INCs to contractors in addition to operators. The policy indicates that BSEE's enforcement actions will continue to focus primarily on lessees and operators, but makes it clear that BSEE will \u201cin appropriate circumstances\u201d also issue INCs to contractors for \"serious violations\" of BSEE regulations. Further, the industry has adopted new standards, including API Standard 53 relating to the maintenance, inspection and testing of well control equipment. The imposition of INCs on contractors exposes us to fines and penalties for violation of BSEE regulations and the new standards expose us to increased costs and loss of revenue.\nNew regulatory, legislative, permitting or certification requirements in the U.S., including laws and regulations that have or may impose increased financial responsibility, oil spill abatement contingency plan capability requirements, or additional operational requirements and certifications, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nWe anticipate that government regulation in other countries where we operate may follow the U.S. in regard to enhanced safety and environmental regulation, which could also result in governments imposing sanctions on contractors for operators not complying with regulations that impact drilling operations. Even if not a requirement in these countries, most international operating companies, and many others, are voluntarily complying with some or all of the U.S. inspections and safety and environmental guidelines when operating outside the U.S. Such additional governmental regulation and voluntary compliance by operators could increase the cost of our operations and expose us to greater liability.\nLaws and governmental regulations may add to costs, limit our drilling activity or reduce demand for our drilling services.\nOur operations are affected by political developments and by laws and regulations that relate directly to the oil and gas industry, including initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The offshore contract drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas industry. Accordingly, we will be directly affected by the approval and adoption of laws and regulations limiting or curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, safety and other policy reasons. We may be exposed to risks related to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use that could reduce the use of oil or natural gas, thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel and our drilling services. Governments also may pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our drilling services. Furthermore, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures or incur substantial additional costs to comply with new governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or significantly increasing our operating costs.\nGeopolitical events, terrorist attacks, piracy and military action could affect the markets for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business and cost and availability of insurance.\nGeopolitical events have resulted in military actions, terrorist, pirate and other armed attacks, civil unrest, political demonstrations, mass strikes and government responses. Military action by the United States or other nations could escalate, and acts of terrorism, piracy, kidnapping, extortion, acts of war, violence, civil war, or general disorder may initiate or continue. Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours. Such developments have caused instability in the world\u2019s financial and insurance markets in the past. In addition, these developments could lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our products and services. Insurance premiums could increase and coverage for these kinds of events may be unavailable in the future. Any or all of these effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.\nFailure to recruit and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe require skilled personnel to operate our drilling rigs and to provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for skilled and other labor has intensified as additional, more technically advanced, rigs are added to the worldwide fleet. There are 200 newbuild offshore drilling rigs reported to be on order or under construction with delivery expected by the end of 2020. These rigs will require more workers with specialized training and skills to operate. In periods of high utilization, it is more difficult and costly to recruit and retain qualified employees, especially in foreign countries that require a certain percentage of national employees. Competition for such personnel could increase our future operating expenses, with a resulting reduction in net income, or impact our ability to fully staff and operate our rigs. We may also incur additional costs to provide training for prospective employees for skilled positions on our newer rigs.\nWe may be required to maintain or increase existing levels of compensation to retain our skilled workforce, especially if our competitors raise their wage rates. Much of the skilled workforce is nearing retirement age, which may impact the availability of skilled personnel. We also are subject to potential legislative or regulatory action that may impact working conditions, paid time off or other conditions of employment. If such labor trends continue, they could further increase our costs or limit our ability to fully staff and operate our rigs and create the potential for more work stoppages, which may be beyond our control.\nUnionization efforts and labor regulations in certain countries in which we operate could materially increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nA large percentage of our employees in non-U.S. markets are protected by collective bargaining agreements that require periodic salary negotiations, which usually result in higher personnel expenses and other benefits. Efforts have been made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce. In addition, we have been subjected to strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions in certain countries. Additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our costs, reduce our revenues or limit our flexibility.\nCertain legal obligations require us to contribute certain amounts to retirement funds or other benefit plans and restrict our ability to dismiss employees. Future regulations or court interpretations established in the countries in which we conduct our operations could increase our costs and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nCompliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations.\nOur operations are subject to laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, pollution, contamination and hazardous waste disposal or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental laws and regulations specifically applicable to our business activities could impose significant liability on us for damages, clean-up costs, fines and penalties in the event of oil spills or similar discharges of pollutants or contaminants into the environment or improper disposal of hazardous waste generated in the course of our operations. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, and we have not experienced an accident that has exposed us to material liability arising out of or relating to discharges of pollutants into the environment. However, the legislative, judicial and regulatory response to a well incident could substantially increase our and our customers' liabilities. In addition to potential increased liabilities, such legislative, judicial or regulatory action could impose increased financial, insurance or other requirements that may adversely impact the entire offshore drilling industry.\nThe International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation, Marpol 73/78, the U.K. Merchant Shipping Act 1995, the U.K. Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation Convention) Regulations 1998, and other related legislation and regulations and Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (\"OPA 90\"), the Clean Water Act and other U.S. federal statutes applicable to us and our operations, as well as similar statutes in Texas, Louisiana, other coastal states and other non-U.S. jurisdictions, address oil spill prevention and control and significantly expand liability, fine and penalty exposure across many segments of the oil and gas industry. Such statutes and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on us related to the prevention of oil spills, disposal of waste and liability for resulting damages. For instance, OPA 90 imposes strict and, with limited exceptions, joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs as well as a variety of fines, penalties and damages. Although the OPA 90 provides for certain limits of liability, such limits are not applicable where there is any safety violation or where gross negligence is involved. Failure to comply with these statutes and regulations, including OPA 90, may subject us to civil or criminal enforcement action, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. Further, remedies under the Clean Water Act and related legislation and the OPA 90 do not preclude claims under state regulations or civil claims for damages to third parties under state laws.\nEvents in recent years, including the Macondo well incident, have heightened governmental and environmental concerns about the oil and gas industry. From time to time, legislative proposals have been introduced that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas. We are adversely affected by restrictions on drilling in certain areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, including the adoption of associated new safety requirements and policies regarding the approval of drilling permits, restrictions on development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and associated rules, directives and regulations that have and may further impact our operations. If new laws are enacted or other government action is taken that restrict or prohibit offshore drilling in our principal\nareas of operation or impose environmental protection requirements that materially increase the liabilities, financial requirements or operating or equipment costs associated with offshore drilling, exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may limit our liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $5.9 billion in total debt outstanding, representing approximately 42% of our total capitalization. Our current indebtedness may have several important effects on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\na portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest;\n\u2022\ncovenants contained in our debt arrangements require us to meet certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business and may limit our ability to dispose of assets or place restrictions on the use of proceeds from such dispositions, withstand current or future economic or industry downturns and compete with others in our industry for strategic opportunities; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and general corporate or other cash requirements may be limited.\nOur ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to meet our financial obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our future cash flows may be insufficient to meet all of our working capital requirements, debt obligations and contractual commitments, and any insufficiency could negatively impact our business.\nTo the extent we are unable to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due or at maturity with cash on hand or from other sources, we will need to refinance our debt, sell assets or repay the debt with the proceeds from equity offerings. Additional indebtedness or equity financing may not be available to us in the future for the refinancing or repayment of existing indebtedness, or if available, such additional indebtedness or equity financing may not be available on a timely basis, or on terms acceptable to us and within the limitations specified in our then existing debt instruments. In addition, in the event we decide to sell additional assets, we can provide no assurance as to the timing of any asset sales or the proceeds that could be realized by us from any such asset sale.\nIn addition, our access to credit and capital markets depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. A decrease in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to raise capital. In addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. As a result, a downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe have historically made substantial capital expenditures to maintain our fleet, and we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain our competitiveness, to comply with laws and the applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and organizations, or to expand our fleet, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition, result of operations and cash flows.\nWe have historically made substantial capital expenditures to maintain our fleet. These expenditures could increase as a result of changes in:\n\u2022\noffshore drilling technology;\n\u2022\nthe cost of labor and materials;\n\u2022\ncustomer requirements;\n\u2022\nfleet size;\n\u2022\nthe cost of replacement parts for existing drilling rigs;\n\u2022\nthe geographic location of the drilling rigs;\n\u2022\nlength of drilling contracts;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization and technical standards relating to safety, security or the environment; and\n\u2022\nindustry standards.\nChanges in offshore drilling technology, customer requirements for new or upgraded equipment and competition within our industry may require us to make significant capital expenditures in order to maintain our competitiveness. In addition, changes in governmental regulations, relating to safety or equipment standards, as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations, may require us to make additional unforeseen capital expenditures. As a result, we may be required to take our rigs out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding losses of revenues, in order to make such alterations or to add such equipment. In the future, market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable us to operate our older rigs profitably during the remainder of their economic lives.\nAdditionally, in order to expand our fleet, we may require additional capital in the future. If we are unable to fund capital with cash flows from operations or sales of non-core assets, we may be required to either incur additional borrowings or raise capital through the sale of debt or equity securities. Our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by our financial condition at the time, by changes in laws and regulations (or interpretation thereof) and by adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, existing shareholders may experience dilution. Our failure to obtain the funds for necessary future capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant part or equipment shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier\nquality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs, decrease our revenues and adversely impact our operations.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, parts, components and sub-systems used in our operations exposes us to potential volatility in the quality, prices and availability of such items. Certain high-specification parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, or in some cases must be sourced through a single supplier, manufacturer or service provider. Recent industry consolidation has reduced the number of available suppliers. A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers, thus adversely impacting our operations and revenues or increase our operating costs.\nOur long-term contracts are subject to the risk of cost increases, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nIn general, our costs increase as the demand for contract drilling services and skilled labor increases. While many of our contracts include cost escalation provisions that allow changes to our day rate based on stipulated cost increases or decreases, the timing and amount earned from these day rate adjustments may differ from our actual increase in costs and certain contracts do not allow for such day rate adjustments. During times of reduced demand, reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare our rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed. Moreover, as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation. Equipment maintenance expenses\nfluctuate depending upon the type of activity a drilling rig is performing and the age and condition of the equipment. Contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required.\nOur information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.\nWe depend on technologies, systems, and networks to conduct our offshore and onshore operations, to collect payments from customers and to pay vendors and employees. The risks associated with cyber incidents and attacks to our information technology systems could include disruptions of certain systems on our rigs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations; loss of intellectual property, proprietary information or customer data; disruption of our customers' operations; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. If we were to experience a cyber-attack or incident, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTax authorities may challenge our tax positions, and we may not be able to realize expected tax benefits.\nOur tax positions are subject to audit by U.K., U.S. and other foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with our interpretations or assessments of the effects of tax laws, treaties, or regulations or their applicability to our corporate structure or certain transactions we have undertaken. Even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expenses in defending our position and contesting claims or positions asserted by tax authorities. If we are unsuccessful in defending them, such audits could significantly impact our consolidated effective income tax rate in past or future periods.\nWe cannot provide any assurances as to what our consolidated effective income tax rate will be because of, among other matters, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as potential changes in U.K., U.S. and other foreign tax laws, regulations or treaties or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities or any reclassification or other matter (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes or deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. If we are unable to mitigate the negative consequences of any change in law, audit or other matter, this could cause our consolidated effective income tax rate to increase and cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and/or cash flows.\nGovernments may pass laws that subject us to additional taxation or may challenge our tax positions, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere is increasing uncertainty with respect to tax laws, regulations and treaties, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof that may affect our business. In July 2014, the U.K. government enacted tax reforms to ensure that more of the profits generated by offshore drilling contractors in the U.K. are subject to U.K. taxation. The reforms limit the amount of certain types of lease payments that can be deducted for U.K. tax purposes. In addition, the reforms prohibit taxable profits from operations on the U.K. Continental Shelf from being reduced by unrelated losses or expenses. Other countries are evaluating legislative and regulatory reforms that would subject us to additional taxation or otherwise challenge our tax positions. Further, our tax positions are subject to audit by U.K., U.S. and other foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with our interpretations or assessments of the effects of tax laws, treaties, or regulations or their applicability to our corporate structure or certain transactions we have undertaken. Even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expenses in defending our position and contesting claims or positions asserted by tax authorities. If we are unsuccessful in defending them, such audits could significantly impact our consolidated effective income tax rate in past or future periods.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, as well as changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities or any reclassification or other matter (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes or deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, we cannot provide any assurances as to what our consolidated effective income tax rate will be in future periods. If we are unable to mitigate the negative consequences of any change in law, audit or other matter, this could cause our\nconsolidated effective income tax rate to increase and cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and/or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Redomestication to the U.K.\nThere are risks associated with the issuance and trading of our Class A ordinary shares that were not associated with our American Depositary Shares (\"ADS\").\nIn connection with the May 2012 termination of our ADS facility and the conversion of our outstanding ADSs into Class A ordinary shares, we entered into arrangements with The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\") whereby DTC has accepted such shares for deposit, book entry and clearing services. The facilities of DTC are widely-used for rapid electronic transfers of securities between participants within the DTC system, which include numerous major international financial institutions and brokerage firms.\nWe entered into this structure in part so that transfers of our shares held in book entry form through DTC will not be subject to a charge for stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (\u201cSDRT\u201d) in the U.K. Generally, stamp duty and/or SDRT are imposed in the U.K. on certain transfers of chargeable securities (which include shares in companies incorporated in the U.K.) at a rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer. Certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems, such as DTC, are charged at a higher rate of 1.5%. Eligibility for acceptance of foreign securities for deposit, book entry, clearing or other services is at the discretion of DTC and may be revoked by DTC under the terms of our agreement and in accordance with the rules, procedures and bylaws of DTC. A condition for continued eligibility of our shares is that DTC and its affiliates will not be liable for stamp duty or SDRT. We have indemnified DTC for any liability arising from stamp duty or SDRT.\nWe have obtained a favorable ruling from Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (\"HMRC\") in respect of stamp duty and SDRT in relation to both the conversion and also our arrangement with DTC. Furthermore, following decisions of the European Court of Justice and the U.K. First-tier Tax Tribunal, HMRC has announced that they will not seek to apply a charge to stamp duty or SDRT on the issuance of shares (or, where it is integral to the raising of new capital, the transfer of new shares) into depository receipt or clearance systems, such as DTC. However, it is possible that the U.K. government may change or enact laws applicable to stamp duty or SDRT in response to this decision, which could have a material effect on the cost of trading in our shares. If DTC determines at any time that our shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, our shares may become ineligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange or inclusion in the S&P 500, and trading in such shares would be disrupted. In this event, DTC has agreed it will provide us advance notice and assist us, to the extent possible, with efforts to mitigate adverse consequences. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares and a resulting adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and/or cash flows.\nWe have not requested a ruling from HMRC on the U.K. tax aspects of the redomestication, and HMRC may disagree with our conclusion.\nWe believe that our redomestication to the U.K. in December 2009 did not result in any material U.K. corporation tax liability to Ensco plc, based on relevant U.K. corporation tax law and the current U.K.-U.S. income tax treaty. Further, we believe that we have satisfied all SDRT payment and filing obligations in connection with the issuance and deposit of our Class A ordinary shares into the ADS facility pursuant to the deposit agreement governing the ADS facility.\nHowever, if HMRC disagrees with this view, it may take the position that material U.K. corporation tax or SDRT liabilities or amounts on account thereof are payable by Ensco plc as a result of the redomestication, in which case we expect that we would contest such assessment. If we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could be materially adverse to our financial position, operating results and/or cash flows. We have not requested an HMRC ruling on the U.K. tax aspects of the redomestication, and there can be no assurance that HMRC will agree with our interpretations of U.K. corporation tax law or any related matters associated therewith.\nExpected financial, logistical and operational benefits of our redomestication to the U.K. may not be realized.\nWe cannot be assured that all of the goals of the redomestication will be achieved, particularly as achievement of our goals is in many important respects subject to factors that we do not control. These factors include the reactions of U.K. and U.S. tax authorities, the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and conduct business and the reactions of investors and analysts.\nWhether we realize other expected financial benefits of the redomestication will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include changes in the relative rate of economic growth in the U.K. compared to the U.S., our financial performance in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies of the U.K. or the U.S., including changes in taxation or interest rates. It is difficult to predict or quantify the effect of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, in part because the occurrence of any of these events or circumstances may be interrelated. If any of these events or circumstances occur, we may not be able to realize the expected financial benefits of the redomestication, and our expenses may increase to a greater extent than if we had not completed the redomestication.\nRealization of the logistical and operational benefits of the redomestication is also dependent on a variety of factors including the geographic regions in which our drilling rigs are deployed, the location of the business unit offices that oversee our global offshore contract drilling operations, the locations of our customers' corporate offices and principal areas of operation and the location of our investors. If events or changes in circumstances occur affecting the aforementioned factors, we may not be able to realize the expected logistical and operational benefits of the redomestication.\nInvestor enforcement of civil judgments against us may be more difficult.\nBecause our parent company is now a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would have been the case for U.S. judgments obtained against us prior to the redomestication. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.\nWe have less flexibility as a U.K. public limited company with respect to certain aspects of capital management than U.S. corporations due to increased shareholder approval requirements.\nDirectors of Delaware and other U.S. corporations may issue, without further shareholder approval, shares of common stock authorized in their certificates of incorporation that were not already issued or reserved. The business corporation laws of Delaware and other U.S. states also provide substantial flexibility in establishing the terms of preferred stock. However, English law provides that a board of directors may only allot shares with the prior authorization of an ordinary resolution of the shareholders, which authorization must state the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under it and specify the date on which it will expire, which must not be more than five years from the date on which the shareholder resolution is passed. An ordinary resolution was passed by shareholders at our last annual meeting in 2014 to authorize the allotment of additional shares for a one-year term. As this authority will expire in May 2015, an ordinary resolution will be put to shareholders at our next annual shareholder meeting seeking their approval to renew the board's authority to allot shares for an additional one-year term.\nEnglish law also generally provides shareholders pre-emption rights over new shares that are issued for cash. However, it is possible, where the board of directors is generally authorized to allot shares, to exclude pre-emption rights by a special resolution of the shareholders or by a provision in the articles of association. Such exclusion of pre-emption rights will cease to have effect when the general allotment authority to which it relates is revoked or expires. If the general allotment authority is renewed, the authority excluding pre-emption rights may also be renewed by a special resolution of the shareholders. A special resolution was passed, in conjunction with an allotment authority at our last annual shareholder meeting in 2014, to exclude pre-emption rights for a one-year term. As this authority will expire\nin May 2015, a special resolution will be put to shareholders at our next annual shareholder meeting seeking their approval to renew the board's authority to exclude pre-emption rights for an additional one-year term.\nEnglish law prohibits us from conducting \"on-market purchases\" as our shares will not be traded on a recognized investment exchange in the U.K. English law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of \"off-market purchases\" without the approval by a special resolution of the shareholders of the terms of the contract by which the purchase(s) is affected. Such approval may only last for a maximum period of five years after the date on which the resolution is passed. A special resolution was passed at the Company's annual shareholder meeting in May 2013 to permit the Company to make \"off-market\" purchases of its own shares pursuant to certain purchase agreements for a five-year term.\nWe have no assurances that situations will not arise where such shareholder approval requirements for any of these actions would deprive our shareholders of substantial benefits.\nOur articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions.\nCertain provisions of our articles of association have anti-takeover effects, such as the ability to issue shares under the Rights Plan (as defined therein). These provisions are intended to ensure that any takeover or change of control of the Company is conducted in an orderly manner, all members of the Company are treated equally and fairly and receive an optimum price for their shares and the long-term success of the Company is safeguarded. Under English law, it may not be possible to implement these provisions in all circumstances.\nThe Company is not subject to the U.K.'s Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nThe Code only applies to an offer for a public company that is registered in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) and securities of which are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) if the company is considered by the Takeover Panel to have its place of central management and control in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man). This is known as the \"residency test.\" The test for central management and control under the Takeover Code is different from that used by the U.K. tax authorities. Under the Takeover Code, the Panel will look to where the majority of the directors of the company are themselves resident for the purposes of determining where the company has its place of central management and control. Accordingly, the Code does not currently apply to the Company and the Company therefore does not have the benefit of the protections the Code affords, including, but not limited to, the requirement that a person who acquires an interest in shares carrying 30% or more of the voting rights in the Company must make a cash offer to all other shareholders at the highest price paid in the 12 months before the offer was announced.\nEnglish law requires that we meet certain additional financial requirements before we declare dividends and return funds to shareholders.\nUnder English law, we are only able to declare dividends and return funds to our shareholders out of the accumulated distributable reserves on our statutory balance sheet. Distributable reserves are a company\u2019s accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. Realized profits are created through the remittance of profits of certain subsidiaries to our parent company in the form of dividends.\nEnglish law also provides that a public company can only make a distribution if, among other things (a) the amount of its net assets (that is, the total excess of assets over liabilities) is not less than the total of its called up share capital and non-distributable reserves and (b) if, and to the extent that, the distribution does not reduce the amount of its net assets to less than that total.\nWe may be unable to remit the profits of our subsidiaries in a timely or tax efficient manner. If at any time we do not have sufficient distributable reserves to declare and pay quarterly dividends, we may undertake a reduction in the capital of the Company, in addition to the reduction in capital taken in 2014, to reduce the amount of our share\ncapital and non-distributable reserves and to create a corresponding increase in our distributable reserves out of which future distributions to shareholders can be made. To comply with English law, a reduction of capital would be subject to (a) approval of shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting by special resolution; (b) confirmation by an order of the English Courts and (c) the Court order being delivered to and registered by the Registrar of Companies in England. If we were to pursue a reduction of capital of the Company as a course of action, and failed to obtain the necessary approvals from shareholders and the English Courts, we may undertake other efforts to allow the Company to declare dividends and return funds to shareholders.", "PERMNO": 62519, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "VALPQ"}
