{"cik": "932696", "company": "INSIGHT ENTERPRISES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe IT hardware, software and services industry is intensely competitive, and actions of our competitors, including manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business. Competition in the industry is based on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability, quality and breadth of product lines, and, increasingly, on the ability to provide services and tailor specific solutions to client needs. Many of our manufacturer and publisher partners are also our competitors, as many sell directly to business customers, particularly larger corporate customers. In addition to the manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, we compete with a large number and wide variety of providers and resellers of IT hardware, software and services. We believe our industry will see further consolidation as product resellers and direct marketers combine operations or acquire or merge with other resellers, service providers and direct marketers to increase efficiency, service capabilities and market share. Moreover, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their product and service offerings. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share.\nThe competitive landscape in which we operate continues to change as new technologies are developed. While innovation helps our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell, it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. For instance, while cloud-based solutions present an opportunity for us, cloud-based solutions and technologies that deliver technology solutions as-a-service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us, or could reduce the amount of hardware or software we sell, leading to a reduction in our sales and/or profitability. Accordingly, we are dependent on continued innovations by our current vendor partners and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers.\nGenerally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions or higher sales of services, which are typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise. Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins or inventory impairment charges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our competitors in each of our operating segments may have greater technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and client requirements. Many current and potential competitors also may have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to their customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors have higher margins and/or lower operating cost structures, allowing them to price more aggressively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nWe rely on our partners for product availability, competitive products to sell and marketing funds and purchasing incentives, which can change significantly in the amounts made available and the requirements year over year. We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and publishers and indirectly through distributors, and the loss of a significant partner relationship could cause a disruption in the availability of products to us. There can be no assurance that manufacturers and publishers will continue to sell or will not limit or curtail the availability of their product to resellers like us. The loss of, or change in business relationship with, any of our key vendor partners could negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, certain manufacturers, publishers and distributors provide us with substantial incentives in the form of rebates, marketing funds and other investments, purchasing incentives, early payment discounts, referral fees and price protections (collectively, \u201cpartner funding\u201d). Partner funding is used to offset, among other things, inventory costs, costs of goods sold, marketing costs and other operating expenses. Certain of these funds are based on our volume of sales or purchases, growth rate of net sales, increases in customer usage, or purchases and marketing programs. If we do not meet the goals of these programs or if we are not in compliance with the terms of these programs, there could be a material negative effect on the amount of incentives offered or paid to us by manufacturers and publishers. We continue to experience adverse partner funding program changes that reduce the incentives many partners make available to us and that change the requirements for earning such incentives. If we are unable to react timely to remediate and respond to these changes in partner funding programs of publishers and manufacturers, including the elimination of, or significant reductions in, funding for some of the activities for which we have been compensated in the past, the changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This is especially true in connection with the incentive programs of our largest partners: Microsoft, Dell, Cisco Systems, HP Inc. and Lenovo. There can be no assurance that we will continue to receive such incentives in the future.\nChanges in the IT industry and/or rapid changes in technology may reduce demand for the IT hardware, software and services we sell or change who makes purchasing decisions for IT hardware, software and services. Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, shifts in demand for, or availability of, IT hardware, software, peripherals and services, and industry innovation and the introduction of new products and technologies. The IT industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and changing delivery channels and models, which can decrease demand for current products and services and can disrupt purchasing patterns. If we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes, we may experience lower sales and, with respect to hardware, we may have to record write-downs of obsolete inventory. In addition, in order to satisfy client demand, protect ourselves against product shortages, obtain greater purchasing discounts and react to changes in original equipment manufacturers\u2019 terms and conditions, we may decide to carry inventory of products that may have limited or no return privileges. There can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to inventory obsolescence on these products. Additionally, if purchasing power within our clients shifts from centralized procurement functions to business units or individual end users and we are unable to react timely to any such changes, these shifts in purchasing power could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe cloud and \u201cas-a-service\u201d models are transforming the IT market and introducing new products, services and competitors to the market. In many cases, these new distribution models allow enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially licensed, internally operated software with less complexity and lower initial set-up, operational and licensing costs, which increases competition for us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt to, or compete effectively with, current or future distribution channels or competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe acquisition, integration and operation of acquired businesses, including PCM, may disrupt our business and create additional expenses, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. In connection with our strategic initiatives, we regularly acquire new businesses to expand our technical capabilities, product offerings and customer base and to realize cost savings. All acquisitions entail various risks such as difficulties in realizing the benefits of the acquired business, exposure to unexpected liabilities, difficulties in retaining key employees and adverse customer reactions. In addition, integration of an acquired business, such as PCM, involves\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nnumerous risks, including assimilation of operations of the acquired business and difficulties in the convergence of IT systems, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, risks of entering markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience, assumption of unknown or unquantifiable liabilities, the potential loss of key teammates and/or clients, difficulties in completing strategic initiatives already underway in the acquired company, and unfamiliarity with partners of the acquired company, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The continued integration activities of the acquired businesses into our business is difficult and time consuming, particularly with the integration of a company the size of PCM, and we may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies over the long term. We cannot assure that these risks or other unforeseen factors will not offset the intended benefits of the acquisitions, in whole or in part.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly. Our operating results are highly dependent upon our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales, which fluctuates due to numerous factors, including changes in prices from partners, changes in the amount and timing of partner funding, volumes of purchases, changes in client mix, management of our cash conversion cycle, the relative mix of products and services sold during the period, general competitive conditions, and strategic product and services pricing and purchasing actions. As a result of significant price competition and our higher concentration of large enterprise clients, our gross margins are low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the future. Increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for certain IT products and services may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margins. These low gross margins magnify the impact of variations in revenue and operating costs on our operating results. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on anticipated net sales and the anticipated amount and timing of partner funding, and a portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed. Therefore, we may not be able to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected net sales shortfall, and we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to mitigate any further reductions in gross margins in the future. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. In addition, a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our partners could increase our need for and cost of working capital and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our international operations that are different than the risks associated with our operations in the United States, and our exposure to the risks of a global market could hinder our ability to maintain and expand international operations. Outside of the United States, we have operation centers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Philippines and the United Kingdom, as well as sales offices throughout EMEA and APAC. In the regions in which we do not currently have a physical presence, we serve our clients through strategic relationships. In implementing our international strategy, we may face barriers to entry and competition from local companies and other companies that already have established global businesses, as well as the risks generally associated with conducting business internationally. The success and profitability of international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as:\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulation or taxation (foreign and domestic);\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in import/export laws, regulations and customs and duties and tariffs (foreign and domestic);\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions (foreign and domestic);\n\u2022\ndifficulties of conducting business, managing operations, and costs of staffing in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or other changes in labor conditions;\n\u2022\ntaxes and other restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States;\n\u2022\nextended payment terms;\n\u2022\nseasonal reductions in business activity in some parts of the world; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, public health concerns (including health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases such as the coronavirus) and other geopolitical uncertainties.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nIn addition, changes in policies and/or laws of the United States or foreign governments, including data privacy restrictions such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) resulting in, among other changes, higher taxation, tariffs or similar protectionist laws, currency conversion limitations, limitations on business operations, or the nationalization of private enterprises could reduce the anticipated benefits of international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, including intercompany transactions outside the United States, and we currently conduct limited hedging activities. In addition, some currencies may be subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies, which can limit the ability to otherwise react to rapid foreign currency devaluations. We cannot predict with precision the effect of future exchange-rate fluctuations, and significant rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational operations also expose us to currency fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign operations to U.S. dollars.\nGeneral economic conditions, including unfavorable economic conditions in a particular region, business or industry sector, may lead our clients to delay or forgo investments in IT hardware, software and services. Weak economic conditions generally or any broad-based reduction in IT spending adversely affects our business, operating results and financial condition. A prolonged slowdown in the global economy or similar crisis, or in a particular region or business or industry sector, or tightening of credit markets, could cause our clients to have difficulty accessing capital and credit sources, delay contractual payments, or delay or forgo decisions to upgrade or add to their existing IT environments, license new software or purchase products or services (particularly with respect to discretionary spending for hardware, software and services). Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Economic or industry downturns could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of our expectations. A significant deterioration in our ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing under our accounts receivable securitization program.\nOur sales to our public sector customers are also impacted by government spending policies, government shutdowns, budget priorities and revenue levels. An adverse change in government spending policies (including budget cuts at the federal, state and local level), budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public sector customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us. These possible actions or the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations or practices could have a material adverse effect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nPolitical developments, economic instability or natural disasters impacting international trade, including continued uncertainty surrounding the Referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s Membership in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and, trade disputes and increased tariffs, particularly between the United States and China, may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions or drive sentiment that weakens demand for our products and services. Potential adverse consequences of Brexit such as global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face risks related to health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases. For example, there have been recent outbreaks in several countries, including China, of the highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus. The outbreak of such communicable diseases could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries. Since some of our business partners\u2019 and our operations are in China and other Asian countries, an outbreak of communicable diseases in Asia or elsewhere, or the perception that such an outbreak could occur, and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could adversely affect our business, supply chain, financial\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\ncondition or results of operations. Additionally, an outbreak could significantly disrupt our business by limiting our ability to travel or adversely impact the ability of our manufacturers, publishers and distributors to ship materials, thereby forcing temporary disruption in the availability of products that we sell to our clients.\nOur acquisition strategy may increase our outstanding debt and interest expense and decrease the availability under our financing facilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To fund our acquisition initiatives, we increase our total borrowings from time to time, such as with the PCM acquisition. These additional borrowings have the effect of increasing our future interest expenses and require escalating amortization payments. Additionally, certain of our financing facilities have interest rates that vary based on market conditions and on utilization, which increases our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and may result in greater interest expense than we have forecasted.\nOur financing facilities contain covenants that we must comply with in order to avoid an occurrence of an event of default. The covenants include, among other things, limitations on the payment of dividends and compliance with certain minimum fixed charge ratio and minimum receivables requirements, as well as meeting monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. Our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants and to make scheduled payments on our financing facilities depends on our financial and operating performance. If we were unable to maintain compliance or to repay the borrowed amounts, the lenders under our financing facilities could declare an event of default and demand payment within a specified period of time.\nCyberattacks and breaches in the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon automated information technology processes. Privacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border commerce increases. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain proprietary and confidential information, including information about teammates and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes. In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business. Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. We have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches; however, as newer technologies evolve, and the portfolio of the service providers we share confidential information with grows, we could be exposed to increased risks from breaches in security, including those from human error, negligence or mismanagement or from illegal or fraudulent acts, such as cyberattacks.\nThe evolving nature of threats to data security, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists, including computer viruses, malware, phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, make it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our teammates\u2019, partners\u2019 and clients\u2019 confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Malicious individuals or organizations may attempt to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Such individuals or organizations also may develop or deploy viruses, worms, ransomware or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities of our systems or our product offerings, or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, customers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our systems or data. Cyberthreats, data breaches, malware and similar disruptions from unauthorized access or tampering by malicious actors or inadvertent error could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, resulting in\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\ncompromise of confidential or technical business information harming our reputation and competitive position.\nLike many other businesses, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to electronic data attacks and threats, although we do not believe attacks have resulted in the misappropriation of sensitive data in a material way. Additionally, some of the hardware and software products we resell could have defects or otherwise be the subject of security breaches and other attacks. We would consider the consequences of such attacks to be the responsibility of the respective manufacturers and publishers of such products, however, if such circumstances were to arise, we may be required to notify regulators and individuals of a data breach and could be subject to litigation.\nDisruptions in our IT systems and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses. We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our clients. Our ability to provide that level of service is largely dependent on the ease of use, accuracy, quality and utilization of our IT systems, which affects our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems, and the reliability of our voice and data networks and managed services offerings. If our current technology is determined to have a shorter economic life or the value of our current system is impaired, or necessary improvements to our technology are significantly delayed, we could incur additional expense and/or charges. The continuing development of our IT systems is crucial for our success. Accordingly, some of our IT systems are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the information systems. In addition, we plan to migrate our EMEA operations to the same IT system used in North America and APAC. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in these efforts at all times or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties. In addition, a substantial interruption in our IT systems or in our voice and data networks, however caused, could occur and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our commercial and public sector contracts could result in, among other things, damages, fines or other liabilities. Sales to commercial clients are based on stated contractual terms, the terms and conditions on our website or terms contained in purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis. Sales to public sector clients are derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental departments and agencies, as well as to educational institutions, through open market sales and various contracts and programs. Noncompliance with contract terms, particularly to highly regulated public sector clients, or with government procurement regulations and other requirements could result in fines or penalties against us or termination of contracts, and, in the public sector, could also result in civil, criminal, and administrative liability. With respect to our public sector clients, the government\u2019s remedies may include suspension or debarment. In addition, almost all of our contracts have default provisions, and substantially all of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency.\nWe are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and client audits and failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business, results of operations or cash flows. We are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, which include commercial, employment, tort and other litigation. Because of our significant sales to governmental entities, we also are subject to audits by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities in the ordinary course of our business. We also are subject to and currently engage in audits by various vendor partners and large customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. In addition, we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts. Current and future litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome. Additionally, our operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including areas of labor and employment, advertising, e-commerce, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, data privacy requirements, including data privacy restrictions such as the GDPR or the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), anti-competition, and environmental, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business, and the risk of noncompliance. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no guarantee against teammates, contractors, or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\nWe are exposed to accounts receivable risks. We extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales, typically on 30-day payment terms. We are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased, or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced, the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or, in the case of public sector customers, during periods of budget constraints.\nWe rely on independent shipping companies for delivery of products and are subject to price increases or service interruptions from these carriers. We generally ship hardware products to our customers by FedEx, United Parcel Service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges. If we are unable to pass on to our clients future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services, our profitability could be adversely affected. Additionally, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions sustained by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on certain key personnel. We rely on key management teammates to execute our strategy to grow profitable market share. The loss of one or more of these leaders, or a failure to attract and retain new executives, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service and technical teammates, and we make significant investments in the training of our leadership team, sales account executives, architects and services engineers. If we are not able to retain such personnel or to train them quickly enough to meet changing market conditions, we could experience a drop in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales and services teammates, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business. We have warehouse and distribution facilities in the United States and Canada and in the United Kingdom and Germany. If the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence, we could utilize another distribution center or third-party distributors to ship products to our customers. However, this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs. In addition, we operate customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both business-critical data and confidential information of our customers. A natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nChanges in, interpretations of, or enforcement trends related to tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective income tax rates or operating margins and we may be required to pay additional tax assessments. We conduct business globally and file tax returns in various U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in pre-tax income in various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022\nincreases in corporate tax rates and the availability of deductions or credits in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, and/or interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to U.S. federal and state regulations or interpretations resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017;\n\u2022\ntax effects related to acquisition accounting; and\n\u2022\nresolutions of issues arising from tax examinations and any related interest or penalties.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation, judgment and complex calculations in situations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain. Our determination of tax liabilities is always subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, unpatented proprietary know-how, and patents, as well as confidentiality, invention assignment, non-solicitation and non-competition agreements. There can be no assurance that these measures will afford us sufficient protection of our intellectual property, and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. The disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our registered trademarks and trade names are subject to challenge by third parties. This may affect our ability to continue using those marks and names. Likewise, many businesses are actively investing in, developing and seeking protection for intellectual property in the areas of search, indexing, e-commerce and other Web-related technologies, as well as a variety of on-line business models and methods, all of which are in addition to traditional research and development efforts for IT products and application software, and non-practicing entities continue to invest in acquiring patent portfolios for the purpose of turning the portfolios into income-generating assets, whether through licensing campaigns or litigation. If there is a determination that we have infringed the proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial monetary liability, be forced to stop selling infringing products or providing infringing services, be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, if available, or be prevented from using the rights, which could force us to change our business practices or hardware, software or services offerings in the future. These types of claims and challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have important consequences to our business. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had $859.4 million of total long-term debt outstanding, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), and an additional $253.7 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements. We also have the ability to borrow an additional $629.3 million under our senior secured credit facility. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the following:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to comply with restrictive covenants in our senior secured debt facility, which limits the manner in which we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less-leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\npaying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of notes do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net current assets.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the notes, could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s reported financial results. Under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 470-20, \u201cDebt with Conversion and Other Options,\u201d an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component is treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash at the election of the issuer and are in the money at the reporting date may be included in the treasury stock method under ASC 260, \u201cEarnings Per Share.\u201d To the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount, the shares issuable upon conversion of such notes are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share thus increasing the number of shares included in this calculation. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are required to include the notes in the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nFuture sales of the Company\u2019s common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock. In the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, restricted stock units, upon conversion of the notes and in connection with the warrants to be issued in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or equity-linked securities, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities.\nThe Company is subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of such option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nThe Company may face risk associated with the discontinuation of and transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark interest rate. The Company has outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on LIBOR, and it is anticipated that LIBOR will be discontinued as of the year ending 2021. The expected discontinuation of LIBOR will require lenders and their borrowers to transition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark interest rate, which could have an impact on and risk to the Company if not completed in a timely manner. The Company\u2019s current material loan documents include an alternative benchmark interest rate. At this time, however, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates in the future. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact our contracts which terminate after 2021. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates in the future may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 81220, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "NSIT"}
