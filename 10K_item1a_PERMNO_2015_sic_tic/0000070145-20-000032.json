{"cik": "70145", "company": "NATIONAL FUEL GAS CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A Risk Factors\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nThe Company is dependent on capital and credit markets to successfully execute its business strategies.\nThe Company relies upon short-term bank borrowings, commercial paper markets and longer-term capital markets to finance capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations. The Company is dependent on these capital sources to provide capital to its subsidiaries to fund operations, acquire, maintain and develop properties, and execute growth strategies. The availability and cost of credit sources may be cyclical and these capital sources may not remain available to the Company. Continued turmoil in credit markets, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, may make it difficult for the Company to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, or to refinance maturing debt. These difficulties could adversely affect the Company's growth strategies, operations and financial performance.\nThe Company's ability to borrow under its credit facilities and commercial paper agreements, and its ability to issue long-term debt under its indentures, depend on the Company's compliance with its obligations under the facilities, agreements and indentures. For example, to issue incremental long-term debt, the Company must meet an interest coverage test under its 1974 indenture. In general, the Company\u2019s operating income, subject to certain adjustments, over a consecutive 12-month period within the 15 months preceding the debt issuance, must be not less than two times the total annual interest charges on the Company\u2019s long-term debt, taking into account the incremental issuance. In addition, the Company must maintain a ratio of long-term debt to consolidated assets (as defined under the 1974 indenture) of not more than 60%. Depending on their magnitude, factors that reduce the Company\u2019s operating income and/or consolidated assets, including impairments (i.e., write-downs) of the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas properties, could contribute to the Company\u2019s inability to meet the interest coverage test or debt-to-assets ratio. In light of impairments recognized in fiscal 2020, and potentially in fiscal 2021, the Company will be precluded from issuing incremental long-term debt for several quarters in fiscal 2021. The 1974 indenture would not preclude the Company from issuing long-term debt to replace maturing long-term debt, including the Company\u2019s 4.90% notes, in the principal amount of $500 million, maturing in December 2021.\nIn addition, the Company's short-term bank loans and commercial paper are in the form of floating rate debt or debt that may have rates fixed for very short periods of time, resulting in exposure to interest rate fluctuations in the absence of interest rate hedging transactions. The cost of long-term debt, the interest rates on the Company's short-term bank loans and commercial paper and the ability of the Company to issue commercial paper are affected by its credit ratings published by S&P, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings. A downgrade in the Company's credit ratings could increase borrowing costs, negatively impact the availability of capital from banks, commercial paper purchasers and other sources, and require the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to post letters of credit, cash or other assets as collateral with certain counterparties. On March 27, 2020, the Company was downgraded by S&P to a rating of BBB- with a negative outlook, which S&P revised on June 3, 2020 to a rating of BBB- with a stable outlook. Combined with current ratings from other credit rating agencies, that downgrade increased the Company's short-term borrowing costs under its Credit Agreement. Additionally, $600 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding long-term debt would be subject to an interest rate increase if certain fundamental changes occur that involve a material subsidiary and result in a downgrade of a credit rating assigned to the notes below investment grade. In addition to the $600 million, another $500 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding long-term debt would be subject to an interest rate increase based solely on a downgrade of a credit rating assigned to the notes below investment grade, regardless of any additional fundamental changes. If the Company is not able to maintain investment-grade credit ratings, it may not be able to access commercial paper markets.\nClimate change, and the regulatory, legislative and capital access developments related to climate change, may adversely affect operations and financial results.\nClimate change could create physical risks, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. Physical risks include changes in weather conditions, which could cause demand for gas to increase or decrease. If there were to be any impacts from climate change to the Company\u2019s operations and financial results, the Company expects that they would likely occur over a long period of time and thus are difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. Extreme weather events may result in adverse physical effects on portions of the country\u2019s gas infrastructure, which could disrupt the Company\u2019s supply chain and ultimately its operations. Disruption of production activities, and transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency, and customer service interruption.\nClimate change, and the laws, regulations and other initiatives to address climate change, may impact the Company\u2019s financial results. On November 4, 2020, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement, the international effort to establish emissions reduction goals for signatory countries. It is not possible at this time to predict whether changes in the federal administration may change the country\u2019s participation in or the terms on which the U.S. may reenter the Paris Agreement. Despite the recent federal withdrawal, state and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and financial institutions have made, and will likely continue to make, more aggressive efforts to reduce emissions and advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed or adopted in recent years in an attempt to limit the effects of climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, could have significant impacts on the energy industry including government-imposed limitations, prohibitions or moratoriums on the use of gas and oil as well as accelerated depreciation of assets and/or stranded assets. For example, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered bills that would establish a cap-and-trade program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. A number of states have adopted energy strategies or plans with goals that include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Pennsylvania has a methane reduction framework for the oil and gas industry which has resulted in permitting changes with the stated goal of reducing methane emissions from well sites, compressor stations and pipelines. With respect to its operations in California, the Company currently complies with California cap-and-trade guidelines, which increases the Company\u2019s cost of environmental compliance in its Exploration and Production segment operation. In addition, the NYPSC initiated a proceeding to consider climate-related financial disclosures at the utility operating level, and the NY State legislature passed the CLCPA, which created emission reduction and electric generation mandates, and could ultimately impact the Utility segment\u2019s customer base and the Utility segment\u2019s business. Legislation or regulation that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could also include greenhouse gas emissions limits and reporting requirements, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates to conserve energy or use renewable energy sources. Additionally, the trend toward increased conservation, competition from renewable energy sources, and technological advances to address climate change may reduce the demand for natural gas. For further discussion of the risks associated with environmental regulation to address climate change, refer to Item 7, MD&A under the heading \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d and subheading \u201cEnvironmental Regulation.\u201d\nFurther, recent trends directed toward a low-carbon economy could shift funding away from, or limit or restrict certain sources of funding for, companies focused on fossil fuel-related development or carbon-intensive investments. To the extent financial markets view climate change and greenhouse gas emissions as a financial risk, the Company\u2019s cost of and access to capital could be negatively impacted.\nOrganized opposition to the oil and gas industry could have an adverse effect on Company operations.\nOrganized opposition to the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production activity and pipeline expansion and replacement projects, may continue to increase as a result of, among other things, safety incidents involving gas facilities, and concerns raised by politicians, financial institutions and advocacy groups about greenhouse gas emissions, hydraulic fracturing, or fossil fuels generally. This opposition may lead to increased regulatory and legislative initiatives that could place limitations, prohibitions or moratoriums on the use of gas and oil, impose costs tied to carbon emissions, provide cost advantages to alternative energy sources, or impose mandates that increase operational costs associated with new natural gas infrastructure and\ntechnology. This opposition may also lead to increased litigation that could cause operational delays or restrictions, and increase the Company\u2019s operating costs. In turn, these factors could impact the competitive position of natural gas, ultimately affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nDelays or changes in plans or costs with respect to Company projects, including regulatory delays or denials with respect to necessary approvals, permits or orders, could delay or prevent anticipated project completion and may result in asset write-offs and reduced earnings.\nConstruction of the Pipeline and Storage segment\u2019s planned pipelines and storage facilities, as well as the expansion of existing facilities, is subject to various regulatory, environmental, political, legal, economic and other development risks, including the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms, or at all. Existing or potential third party opposition, such as opposition from landowner and environmental groups, which are beyond our control, could materially affect the anticipated construction of a project. In addition, third parties could impede the Gathering segment\u2019s acquisition, expansion or renewal of rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms. Any delay in project construction may prevent a planned project from going into service when anticipated, which could cause a delay in the receipt of revenues from those facilities, result in asset write-offs and materially impact operating results or anticipated results. Additionally, delays in pipeline construction projects could impede the Exploration and Production segment's ability to transport its production to premium markets, or to fulfill obligations to sell at contracted delivery points.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nAs a holding company, the Company depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nThe Company is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its operating subsidiaries. In order to meet its financial needs, the Company relies exclusively on repayments of principal and interest on intercompany loans made by the Company to its operating subsidiaries and income from dividends. Such operating subsidiaries may not generate sufficient net income to pay upstream dividends or generate sufficient cash flow to make payments of principal or interest on such intercompany loans.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by economic conditions and their impact on our suppliers and customers.\nPeriods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased energy consumption, particularly by industrial and large commercial companies. As a consequence, national or regional recessions or other downturns in economic activity, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and cash flows or restrict its future growth. The Company is monitoring and responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic across its businesses. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company. However, the Company cannot predict the extent or duration of the outbreak or whether this rapidly evolving situation will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s workforce, supply chain, operations or financial results, including potential regulatory responses to the financial impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and its customers. Economic conditions in the Company\u2019s utility service territories, along with legislative and regulatory prohibitions on terminations of service, also impact its collections of accounts receivable. For instance, New York enacted legislation in June 2020 that prohibits residential utility terminations for nonpayment for the duration of the New York State COVID Disaster Emergency (currently running until December 3, 2020), and thereafter, the law prohibits terminations for nonpayment through March 31, 2021 for residential customers that attest to Distribution that they have experienced a change in financial circumstances due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. All of the Company\u2019s segments are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness or performance of key suppliers and customers, many of which may be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets, including volatility caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These conditions could result in financial instability or other adverse effects at any of our suppliers or customers. For example, counterparties to the Company\u2019s commodity hedging arrangements or commodity sales contracts might not be able to perform their obligations under these arrangements or contracts. Customers of the Company\u2019s Utility segment may have\nparticular trouble paying their bills during periods of declining economic activity or high commodity prices, potentially resulting in increased bad debt expense and reduced earnings; the PaPUC has directed utilities to track extraordinary, nonrecurring incremental COVID-19 related expenses, and has authorized the creation of a utility regulatory asset but only for incremental uncollectible expenses incurred above those embedded in rates, therefore it is unclear at this time to what extent the PaPUC will, and whether the NYPSC will at all, allow rate recovery for COVID-19 pandemic related expenses. Similarly, if reductions were to occur in funding of the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, bad debt expense could increase and earnings could decrease. In addition, oil and gas exploration and production companies that are customers of the Company\u2019s Pipeline and Storage segment may decide not to renew contracts for the same transportation capacity during periods of reduced production due to persistent low commodity prices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChanges in interest rates may affect the Company\u2019s financing and its regulated businesses\u2019 rates of return.\nRising interest rates may impair the Company\u2019s ability to cost-effectively finance capital expenditures and to refinance maturing debt. In addition, the Company\u2019s authorized rate of return in its regulated businesses is based upon certain assumptions regarding interest rates. If interest rates are lower than assumed rates, the Company\u2019s authorized rate of return could be reduced. If interest rates are higher than assumed rates, the Company\u2019s ability to earn its authorized rate of return may be adversely impacted.\nFluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nOperations in the Company\u2019s Exploration and Production segment are materially dependent on prices received for its oil and gas production. Both short-term and long-term price trends affect the economics of exploring for, developing, producing, gathering and processing oil and gas. Oil and gas prices can be volatile and can be affected by: weather conditions, natural disasters, the supply and price of foreign oil and gas, the level of consumer product demand, national and worldwide economic conditions, economic disruptions caused by terrorist activities, acts of war or major accidents, political conditions in foreign countries, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the proximity to, and availability of, sufficient capacity on transportation facilities, regional levels of supply and demand, energy conservation measures, and government regulations. The Company sells the oil and gas that it produces at a combination of current market prices, indexed prices or through fixed-price contracts. The Company hedges a significant portion of future sales that are based on indexed prices utilizing the physical sale counter-party or the financial markets. The prices the Company receives depend upon factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the factors affecting price mentioned above. The Company believes that any prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices could restrict its ability to continue the level of exploration and production activity the Company otherwise would pursue, which could have a material adverse effect on its revenues, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn the Company\u2019s Pipeline and Storage segment, significant changes in the price differential between equivalent quantities of gas at different geographic locations could adversely impact the Company. For example, if the price of gas at a particular receipt point on the Company\u2019s pipeline system increases relative to the price of gas at other locations, then the volume of gas received by the Company at the relatively more expensive receipt point may decrease, or the price the Company charges to transport that gas may decrease. Changes in price differentials can cause shippers to seek alternative lower priced gas supplies and, consequently, alternative transportation routes. In some cases, shippers may decide not to renew transportation contracts due to changes in price differentials. While much of the impact of lower volumes under existing contracts would be offset by the straight fixed-variable rate design, this rate design does not protect Supply Corporation or Empire where shippers do not contract for expiring capacity at the same quantity and rate. If contract renewals were to decrease, revenues and earnings in this segment may decrease. Significant changes in the price differential between futures contracts for gas having different delivery dates could also adversely impact the Company. For example, if the prices of gas futures contracts for winter deliveries to locations served by the Pipeline and Storage segment decline relative to the prices of such contracts for summer deliveries (as a result, for instance, of increased production of gas within the segment\u2019s geographic area or other factors), then\ndemand for the Company\u2019s gas storage services driven by that price differential could decrease. These changes could adversely affect revenues, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company has significant transactions involving price hedging of its oil and gas production as well as its fixed price sale commitments.\nTo protect itself to some extent against unusual price volatility and to lock in fixed pricing on oil and gas production for certain periods of time, the Company\u2019s Exploration and Production segment regularly enters into commodity price derivatives contracts (hedging arrangements) with respect to a portion of its expected production. These contracts may extend over multiple years, covering as much as approximately 80% of the Company\u2019s expected energy production during the current fiscal year, and lesser percentages of subsequent years' expected production. These contracts reduce exposure to subsequent price drops but can also limit the Company\u2019s ability to benefit from increases in commodity prices.\nUse of energy commodity price hedges also exposes the Company to the risk of nonperformance by a contract counterparty. These parties might not be able to perform their obligations under the hedge arrangements.\nIt is the Company\u2019s practice that the use of commodity derivatives contracts comply with various policies in effect in respective business segments. For example, in the Exploration and Production segment, commodity derivatives contracts must be confined to the price hedging of existing and forecast production. The Company maintains a system of internal controls to monitor compliance with its policy. However, unauthorized speculative trades, if they were to occur, could expose the Company to substantial losses to cover positions in its derivatives contracts. In addition, in the event the Company\u2019s actual production of oil and gas falls short of hedged forecast production, the Company may incur substantial losses to cover its hedges.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act increased federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets and certain entities that participate in those markets. Although regulators have issued certain regulations, other rules that may be relevant to the Company have yet to be finalized. For discussion of the risks associated with the Dodd-Frank Act, refer to Item 7, MD&A under the heading \u201cMarket Risk Sensitive Instruments.\u201d\nYou should not place undue reliance on reserve information because such information represents estimates.\nThis Form 10-K contains estimates of the Company\u2019s proved oil and gas reserves and the future net cash flows from those reserves, which the Company\u2019s petroleum engineers prepared and independent petroleum engineers audited. Petroleum engineers consider many factors and make assumptions in estimating oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows. These factors include: historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas; the assumed effect of governmental regulation; and assumptions concerning oil and gas prices, production and development costs, severance and excise taxes, and capital expenditures. Lower oil and gas prices generally cause estimates of proved reserves to be lower. Estimates of reserves and expected future cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may differ substantially. Ultimately, actual production, revenues and expenditures relating to the Company\u2019s reserves will vary from any estimates, and these variations may be material. Accordingly, the accuracy of the Company\u2019s reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.\nIf conditions remain constant, then the Company is reasonably certain that its reserve estimates represent economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows. If conditions change in the future, then subsequent reserve estimates may be revised accordingly. You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from the Company\u2019s proved reserves is the current market value of the Company\u2019s estimated oil and gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves on a 12-month average of historical prices for oil and gas (based on first day of the month prices and adjusted for hedging) and on costs as of the date of the estimate, which are all discounted at the SEC mandated discount rate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially\nfrom those used in the net present value estimate. Any significant price changes will have a material effect on the present value of the Company\u2019s reserves.\nPetroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and other hydrocarbons that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex. The process involves significant assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Future economic and operating conditions are uncertain, and changes in those conditions could cause a revision to the Company\u2019s reserve estimates in the future. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including historical production from the area compared with production from other comparable producing areas, and the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies. Because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves: the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered, the timing of the recovery of oil and gas reserves, the production and operating costs to be incurred, the amount and timing of future development and abandonment expenditures, and the price received for the production.\nFinancial accounting requirements regarding exploration and production activities may affect the Company's profitability.\nThe Company accounts for its exploration and production activities under the full cost method of accounting. Each quarter, the Company must perform a \"ceiling test\" calculation, comparing the level of its unamortized investment in oil and gas properties to the present value of the future net revenue projected to be recovered from those properties according to methods prescribed by the SEC. In determining present value, the Company uses a 12-month historical average price for oil and gas (based on first day of the month prices and adjusted for hedging) as well as the SEC mandated discount rate. If, at the end of any quarter, the amount of the unamortized investment exceeds the net present value of the projected future cash flows, such investment may be considered to be \"impaired,\" and the full cost accounting rules require that the investment must be written down to the calculated net present value. Such an instance would require the Company to recognize an immediate expense in that quarter, and its earnings would be reduced. Depending on the magnitude of any decrease in average prices, that charge could be material. Under the Company's existing indenture covenants, an impairment could restrict the Company's ability to issue incremental long-term unsecured indebtedness for a period of time, beginning with the fourth calendar month following the impairment. For the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized pre-tax impairment charges on its oil and natural gas properties of $253.4 million and $449.4 million, respectively, and the Company will be precluded from issuing incremental long-term unsecured indebtedness for several quarters in fiscal 2021. The Company could potentially record non-cash impairments in future quarters depending on the commodity price environment.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe actual or perceived effects of a widespread public health concern or pandemic, such as COVID-19, could negatively affect our business and results of operations. While to date the Company has not experienced any material negative effects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation continues to rapidly evolve and could result in material negative effects on our business and results of operations. The Company and its Pandemic Response Team are closely monitoring and responding to the impacts of the pandemic on the Company\u2019s workforce, customers, contractors, suppliers, business continuity, and liquidity.\nThe protracted slowdown of broad sectors of the economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the current demand for oil and has the potential to decrease the demand for natural gas, which could reduce the Company's revenues. Additionally, significant changes in legislation or regulatory policy to address the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact the Company. Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows or financial positions, such impacts that may be material include, but are not limited to: (i) a significant reduction in near-term demand for natural gas and/or oil; (ii) increased late or uncollectible customer payments;\n(iii) the inability for the Company\u2019s contractors or suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations; (iv) significant changes in the Company\u2019s human capital management approach, increased cybersecurity threats associated with work-from-home arrangements, and increased purchases of personal protective equipment as the Company prepares its return-to-work plan; (v) difficulties in obtaining financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, or to refinance maturing debt; and (vi) impacts on natural gas and oil pricing and the potential impairment of the recorded value of certain assets as a result of reduced projected cash flows. To the extent the duration of any of these conditions extends for a longer period of time, the adverse impact will generally be more severe.\nThe nature of the Company\u2019s operations presents inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s operations in its various reporting segments are subject to inherent hazards and risks such as: fires; natural disasters; explosions; blowouts during well drilling; collapses of wellbore casing or other tubulars; pipeline ruptures; spills; and other hazards and risks that may cause personal injury, death, property damage, environmental damage or business interruption losses. Additionally, the Company\u2019s facilities, machinery, and equipment may be subject to sabotage. These events, in turn, could lead to governmental investigations, recommendations, claims, fines or penalties. As protection against operational hazards, the Company maintains insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. The Company also seeks, but may be unable, to secure written indemnification agreements with contractors that adequately protect the Company against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. The occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, the imposition of fines, penalties or mandated programs by governmental authorities, the failure of a contractor to meet its indemnification obligations, or the failure of an insurance company to pay valid claims could result in substantial losses to the Company. In addition, insurance may not be available, or if available may not be adequate, to cover any or all of these risks. It is also possible that insurance premiums or other costs may rise significantly in the future, so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive.\nHazards and risks faced by the Company, and insurance and indemnification obtained or provided by the Company, may subject the Company to litigation or administrative proceedings from time to time. Such litigation or proceedings could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines or penalties against the Company or be resolved on unfavorable terms, the result of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThird party attempts to breach the Company\u2019s network security could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and adversely affect its financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems are subject to attempts by others to gain unauthorized access, or to otherwise introduce malicious software. These attempts might be the result of industrial or other espionage, or actions by hackers seeking to harm the Company, its services or customers. These more sophisticated cyber-related attacks, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error, pose a risk to the security of the Company\u2019s systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company\u2019s and its customers\u2019 data. That data may be considered sensitive, confidential, or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. While the Company employs reasonable and appropriate controls to protect data and the Company\u2019s systems, the Company may be vulnerable to material security breaches, lost or corrupted data, programming errors and employee errors and/or malfeasance that could lead to the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of the sensitive, confidential or personal information. Attempts to breach the Company\u2019s network security may result in disruption of the Company\u2019s business operations and services, delays in production, theft of sensitive and valuable data, damage to our physical systems, and reputational harm. Significant expenditures may be required to remedy breaches, including restoration of customer service and enhancement of information technology systems. The Company seeks to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents, but in some cases the Company might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. In addition to existing risks, the adoption of new technologies may also increase the Company\u2019s exposure to data breaches or the Company\u2019s ability to detect and remediate effects of a breach. The Company has experienced attempts to breach its network security and has\nreceived notifications from third-party service providers who have experienced data breaches where Company data was potentially impacted. Although the scope of such incidents is sometimes unknown, they could prove to be material to the Company. Even though insurance coverage is in place for cyber-related risks, if such a breach were to occur, the Company\u2019s operations, earnings and financial condition could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance.\nThe amount and timing of actual future oil and gas production and the cost of drilling are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates, which may reduce the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThere are many risks in developing oil and gas, including numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The future success of the Company\u2019s Exploration and Production and Gathering segments depends on its ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable, and its failure to do so may reduce the Company\u2019s earnings. The total and timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates. The Company\u2019s drilling of development wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, success rates, and cost overruns, and these risks can be affected by lease and rig availability, geology, and other factors. Drilling for oil and gas can be unprofitable, not only from non-productive wells, but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. Also, title problems, weather conditions, governmental requirements, including completion of environmental impact analyses and compliance with other environmental laws and regulations, and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services can delay drilling operations or result in their cancellation. The cost of drilling, completing, and operating wells is significant and often uncertain, and new wells may not be productive or the Company may not recover all or any portion of its investment. Production can also be delayed or made uneconomic if there is insufficient gathering, processing and transportation capacity available at an economic price to get that production to a location where it can be profitably sold. Without continued successful exploitation or acquisition activities, the Company\u2019s reserves and revenues will decline as a result of its current reserves being depleted by production. The Company cannot make assurances that it will be able to find or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs.\nREGULATORY RISKS\nThe Company\u2019s need to comply with comprehensive, complex, and the sometimes unpredictable enforcement of government regulations may increase its costs and limit its revenue growth, which may result in reduced earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of federal and state laws, regulations and policies. Existing statutes and regulations, including current tax rates, may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to the Company, which may increase the Company's costs, require refunds to customers or affect its business in ways that the Company cannot predict. Administrative agencies may apply existing laws and regulations in unanticipated, inconsistent or legally unsupportable ways, making it difficult to develop and complete projects, and harming the economic climate generally.\nVarious aspects of the Company's operations are subject to regulation by a variety of federal and state agencies with respect to permitting and environmental requirements. In some areas, the Company\u2019s operations may also be subject to locally adopted ordinances. Administrative proceedings or increased regulation by these agencies could lead to operational delays or restrictions and increased expense for one or more of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\nThe Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The PHMSA issues regulations and conducts evaluations, among other things, that set safety standards for pipelines and underground storage facilities. If as a result of these or similar new laws or regulations the Company incurs material compliance costs that it is unable to recover fully through rates or otherwise offset, the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to Supply Corporation, Empire and some transactions performed by other Company subsidiaries. The FERC, among other things, approves the rates that Supply Corporation and Empire may charge to their gas transportation and/or storage customers. Those approved rates also impact the returns that Supply Corporation and Empire may earn on the assets that are dedicated to those operations. Pursuant to the petition of a customer or state commission, or on the FERC's own initiative, the FERC has the authority to investigate whether Supply Corporation's and Empire's rates are still \"just and reasonable\" as required by the NGA, and if not, to adjust those rates prospectively. If Supply Corporation or Empire is required in a rate proceeding to adjust the rates it charges its gas transportation and/or storage customers, or if either Supply Corporation or Empire is unable to obtain approval for rate increases, particularly when necessary to cover increased costs, Supply Corporation's or Empire's earnings may decrease. In addition, the FERC exercises jurisdiction over the construction and operation of interstate gas transmission facilities and also possesses significant penalty authority with respect to violations of the laws and regulations it administers.\nThe operations of Distribution Corporation are subject to the jurisdiction of the NYPSC, the PaPUC and, with respect to certain transactions, the FERC. The NYPSC and the PaPUC, among other things, approve the rates that Distribution Corporation may charge to its utility customers. Those approved rates also impact the returns that Distribution Corporation may earn on the assets that are dedicated to those operations. If Distribution Corporation is unable to obtain approval from these regulators for the rates it is requesting to charge utility customers, particularly when necessary to cover increased costs, earnings may decrease.\nEnvironmental regulation significantly affects the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including obtaining and complying with permits, leases, approvals, consents and certifications from various governmental and permit authorities. These laws and regulations concern the generation, storage, transportation, disposal, emission or discharge of pollutants, contaminants, hazardous substances and greenhouse gases into the environment, the reporting of such matters, and the general protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. For example, currently applicable environmental laws and regulations restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of materials that can be released into the environment in connection with regulated activities, limit or prohibit activities in certain protected areas, and may require the Company to investigate and/or remediate contamination at certain current and former properties regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the Company\u2019s actions or whether such actions were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations at the time they were taken. Moreover, spills or releases of regulated substances or the discovery of currently unknown contamination could expose the Company to material losses, expenditures and environmental, health and safety liabilities. Such liabilities could include penalties, sanctions or claims for damages to persons, property or natural resources brought on behalf of the government or private litigants that could cause the Company to incur substantial costs or uninsured losses.\nCosts of compliance and liabilities could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, compliance with environmental laws, regulations or permit conditions could require unexpected capital expenditures at the Company\u2019s facilities, temporarily shut down the Company\u2019s facilities or delay or cause the cancellation of expansion projects or oil and gas drilling activities. Because the costs of such compliance are significant, additional regulation could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nIncreased regulation of exploration and production activities, including hydraulic fracturing, could adversely impact the Company.\nDue to the Marcellus and Utica Shale gas plays in the northeast United States, together with the fiscal difficulties faced by state agencies in Pennsylvania, various state legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding the exploration and production business have been proposed or adopted. These initiatives include potential new or updated statutes and regulations governing the drilling, casing, cementing, testing, abandonment and monitoring of wells, the protection of water supplies and restrictions on water use and water rights, hydraulic fracturing operations, surface owners\u2019 rights and damage compensation, the spacing of wells, use and disposal\nof potentially hazardous materials, and environmental and safety issues regarding gas pipelines. New permitting fees and/or severance taxes for oil and gas production are also possible. Additionally, legislative initiatives in the U.S. Congress and regulatory studies, proceedings or rule-making initiatives at federal, state or local agencies focused on the hydraulic fracturing process, the use of underground injection control wells for produced water disposal, and related operations could result in operational delays or prohibitions and/or additional permitting, compliance, reporting and disclosure requirements, which could lead to increased operating costs and increased risks of litigation for the Company.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by the disallowance of purchased gas costs incurred by the Utility segment.\nTariff rate schedules in each of the Utility segment\u2019s service territories contain purchased gas adjustment clauses which permit Distribution Corporation to file with state regulators for rate adjustments to recover increases in the cost of purchased gas. Assuming those rate adjustments are granted, increases in the cost of purchased gas have no direct impact on profit margins. Distribution Corporation is required to file an accounting reconciliation with the regulators in each of the Utility segment\u2019s service territories regarding the costs of purchased gas. There is a risk of disallowance of full recovery of these costs if regulators determine that Distribution Corporation was imprudent in making its gas purchases. Any material disallowance of purchased gas costs could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and earnings.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe Company\u2019s credit ratings may not reflect all the risks of an investment in its securities.\nThe Company\u2019s credit ratings are an independent assessment of its ability to pay its obligations. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in the Company\u2019s credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the specific debt instruments that are rated, as well as the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company\u2019s credit ratings, however, may not reflect the potential impact on the value of its common stock of risks related to structural, market or other factors discussed in this Form 10-K.\nThe increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the amount of income or expense it expends or records for employee benefit plans. This is particularly true for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns and factors used to determine the value and current costs of plan benefit obligations. In addition, if medical costs rise at a rate faster than the general inflation rate, the Company might not be able to mitigate the rising costs of medical benefits. Increases to the costs of pension, other post-retirement and medical benefits could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nSignificant shareholders or potential shareholders may attempt to effect changes at the Company or acquire control over the Company, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nShareholders of the Company may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over the Company. Campaigns by shareholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term shareholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Additionally, activist shareholders may submit proposals to promote an environmental, social or governance position. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting the Company\u2019s operations and diverting the attention of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. As a result, shareholder campaigns could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 25590, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "NFG"}
