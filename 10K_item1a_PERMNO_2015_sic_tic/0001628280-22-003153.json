{"cik": "932696", "company": "INSIGHT ENTERPRISES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry\nThe IT hardware, software and services industry is intensely competitive, and actions of our competitors, including manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business. Competition in the industry is based on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability, quality and breadth of product lines, and, increasingly, on the ability to provide services and tailor specific solutions to client needs. Many of our manufacturer and publisher partners are also our competitors, as many sell directly to business customers, particularly larger corporate customers. In addition to the manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, we compete with a large number and wide variety of providers and resellers of IT hardware, software and services. We believe our industry will see further consolidation as product resellers and direct marketers combine operations or acquire or merge with other resellers, service providers and direct marketers to increase efficiency, service capabilities and market share. Moreover, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their product and service offerings. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share.\nThe competitive landscape in which we operate continues to change as new technologies are developed. While innovation helps our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell, it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. For instance, while cloud-based solutions present an opportunity for us and make up a significant part of our business and future, cloud-based solutions and technologies developed by manufacturer and publisher partners could be sold directly to customers rather than utilizing solutions providers like us, or such partners could otherwise reduce the amount of hardware or software we sell, leading to a reduction in our sales and/or profitability. Accordingly, we are dependent on continued innovations by our current vendor partners and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers.\nGenerally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions or higher sales of services, which are typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise. Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins or inventory impairment charges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our competitors in each of our operating segments may have greater technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and client requirements. Many current and potential competitors also may have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to their customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors have higher margins and/or lower operating cost structures, allowing them to price more aggressively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our partners for product availability, competitive products to sell and marketing funds and purchasing incentives, which can change significantly in the amounts made available and the requirements year over year. We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and publishers and indirectly through distributors, and the loss of a significant partner relationship could cause a disruption in the availability of products to us. There can be no assurance that manufacturers and publishers will continue to sell or will not limit or curtail the availability of their product to resellers like us. The loss of, or change in business relationship with, any of our key vendor partners could negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, certain manufacturers, publishers and distributors provide us with substantial incentives in the form of rebates, marketing funds and other investments, purchasing incentives, early payment discounts, referral fees and price protections (collectively, \u201cpartner funding\u201d). Partner funding is used to offset, among other things, inventory costs, costs of goods sold, marketing costs and other operating expenses. Certain of these funds are based on our volume of sales or purchases, growth rate of net sales, increases in client usage, or purchases and marketing programs. If we do not meet the goals of these programs or if we are not in compliance with the terms of these programs, there could be a material negative effect on the amount of incentives offered or paid to us by manufacturers and publishers. We\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\ncontinue to experience adverse partner funding program changes that reduce the incentives many partners make available to us and that change the requirements for earning such incentives. If we are unable to react timely to remediate and respond to these changes in partner funding programs of publishers and manufacturers, including the elimination of, or significant reductions in, funding for some of the activities for which we have been compensated in the past, the changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This is especially true in connection with the incentive programs of our largest partners: Microsoft, Dell, Cisco Systems, HP Inc. and Lenovo. There can be no assurance that we will continue to receive such incentives in the future.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with rapidly evolving technological advances and the evolving competitive marketplace in which we sell our service offerings. Our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and market demand to serve the needs of our clients. For example, cloud, security, and digital-related solutions are continuously evolving, and there is rapid development and technological evolution in areas such as IoT, edge-computing, computer vision, advanced machine learning and AI, automation, augmented reality, blockchain and as-a-service solutions. If we do not invest sufficiently in new technologies, successfully adapt to industry developments and evolving client demand at sufficient speed and scale, we may be unable to develop or maintain a competitive advantage in the market and execute on our growth strategy and initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, results of operations and financial condition. The widespread outbreak of any other illnesses or communicable diseases could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. We could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of an illness, any other communicable disease or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions, including the disruption of global supply chains. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in government authorities around the world implementing various measures to try to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, \"shelter-in-place,\" \"stay-at-home,\" total lock-down orders, business limitations or shutdowns and similar orders. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and workforce participation, and initially created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. More recently, new variants of COVID-19, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, that are significantly more contagious than previous strains, have emerged. The spread of these new strains is causing many government authorities and businesses to reimplement prior restrictions in an effort to lessen the spread of COVID-19 and its variants.\nOur business operations have been, and could continue to be, adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as may our financial performance and results of operations. For example, we observed a pronounced impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 financial results when compared to internal expectations and minimal negative impact on our 2021 financial results. We anticipate demand for our products and services may continue to be impacted going into 2022 as suppliers encounter product shortages and clients continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses, their profitability and their liquidity. While we experienced a decline in hardware bookings in response to COVID-19 in 2020, bookings in 2021 have increased significantly and we exited 2021 with elevated bookings going into the first quarter of 2022. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - COVID-19 and Supply Chain Constraints Update\u201d for additional information.\nAdditionally, our business operations, financial performance and results of operations have been and could be further adversely impacted in a number of ways, which may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\u2022disruptions to our operations, including any closures of our offices and facilities; restrictions on our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts; and interruptions to our other important business activities;\n\u2022further reduced demand for our products and services due to disruptions to the businesses and operations of our clients;\n\u2022interruptions, availability or delays in global shipping to transport our products;\n\u2022further disruptions, slowdowns or stoppages in the supply chain for our products;\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n\u2022limitations on employee resources and availability, including due to sickness, government restrictions, labor supply shortages, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people or mass transit disruptions;\n\u2022the ability of our clients to pay for our products, services and solutions;\n\u2022a continuation or worsening of general economic conditions, including increased inflation;\n\u2022the willingness of clients in the travel, hospitality, retail and other industries significantly impacted by the pandemic to continue with current and expected projects;\n\u2022a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates, which could result from market uncertainties;\n\u2022an increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing, which could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities;\n\u2022changes to the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets; and\n\u2022an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility, which could hinder our ability to execute strategic business activities, including acquisitions, as well as negatively impact our stock price.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including suspending most teammate travel, allowing remote teammate work locations, and the cancellation or limitation of physical participation in most meetings, events and conferences), and we anticipate taking further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our clients, partners and teammates. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. Further, should any key teammates become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work, the attention of the management team could be diverted.\nThe potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our other risk factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations, financial performance and results of operations, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, is currently unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, continuously evolving and cannot be predicted. This includes, but is not limited to, the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and its severity; the emergence and severity of its variants; the availability and efficacy of vaccines (particularly with respect to emerging strains of the virus) and potential hesitancy to utilize them; other protective actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, such as restrictions on travel and transportation; general economic factors, such as increased inflation; supply chain constraints; labor supply issues; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nGeneral economic and political conditions, including unfavorable conditions in a particular region, business or industry sector, may lead our clients to delay or forgo investments in IT hardware, software and services. Weak economic conditions generally or any broad-based reduction in IT spending, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affects our business, operating results and financial condition. A prolonged slowdown in the global economy or similar crisis, or in a particular region or business or industry sector, or tightening of credit markets, could cause our clients to have difficulty accessing capital and credit sources, delay contractual payments, or delay or forgo decisions to upgrade or add to their existing IT environments, license new software or purchase products or services (particularly with respect to discretionary spending for hardware, software and services). Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Economic or industry downturns could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of our expectations. A significant deterioration in our ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing under our accounts receivable securitization program.\nOur sales to public sector clients are also impacted by government spending policies, government shutdowns, budget priorities and revenue levels. An adverse change in government spending policies (including budget cuts at the federal, state and local level), budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public sector clients to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us. These possible actions or the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations or practices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWorldwide economic conditions and market volatility as a result of political leadership in certain countries and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets, including increases in\ninflation and interest rates, may impact future business activities. External factors, such as potential terrorist attacks, acts of war, geopolitical and social turmoil or epidemics and other similar outbreaks in many parts of the world, could prevent or hinder our ability to do business, increase our costs and negatively affect our stock price. More generally, these geopolitical, social and economic conditions could result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. Political developments, economic instability or natural disasters impacting international trade, including continued\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nuncertainty surrounding the Referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s Membership in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and, trade disputes and increased tariffs, particularly between the United States and China, may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions or drive sentiment that weakens demand for our products and services. Potential adverse consequences of Brexit such as global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the IT industry and/or rapid changes in technology may reduce demand for the IT hardware, software and services we sell or change who makes purchasing decisions for IT hardware, software and services. Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, shifts in demand for, or availability of, IT hardware, software, peripherals and services, and industry innovation and the introduction of new products and technologies. The IT industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and changing delivery channels and models, which can decrease demand for current products and services and can disrupt purchasing patterns. If we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes, we may experience lower sales and, with respect to hardware, we may have to record write-downs of obsolete inventory. In addition, in order to satisfy client demand, protect ourselves against product shortages, obtain greater purchasing discounts and react to changes in original equipment manufacturers\u2019 terms and conditions, we may decide to carry inventory of products that may have limited or no return privileges. There can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to inventory obsolescence on these products. Additionally, if purchasing power within our clients shifts from centralized procurement functions to business units or individual end users and we are unable to react timely to any such changes, these shifts in purchasing power could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe cloud and \u201cas-a-service\u201d models are transforming the IT market and introducing new products, services and competitors to the market. In many cases, these new distribution models allow enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially licensed, internally operated software with less complexity and lower initial set-up, operational and licensing costs, which increases competition for us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt to, or compete effectively with, current or future distribution channels or competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to accounts receivable risks. We extend credit to our clients for a significant portion of our net sales, typically on 30-day payment terms. We are subject to the risk that our clients may not pay for the products and services they have purchased, or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced, the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or, in the case of public sector clients, during periods of budget constraints.\nWe rely on independent shipping companies for delivery of products and are subject to price increases or service interruptions from these carriers. We generally ship hardware products to our clients by FedEx, United Parcel Service and other commercial delivery services and invoice clients for delivery charges. If we are unable to pass on to our clients current and future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services, our profitability could be adversely impacted. Additionally, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, sustained by such shippers could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our international operations that are different than the risks associated with our operations in the United States, and our exposure to the risks of a global market could hinder our ability to maintain and expand international operations. Outside of the United States, we have operation centers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, the Philippines and the United Kingdom, as well as sales offices throughout EMEA and APAC. In the regions in which we do not currently have a physical presence, we serve our clients through strategic relationships. In implementing our international strategy, we may face barriers to entry and competition from local companies and other companies that already have established global businesses, as well as the risks generally associated with conducting business internationally. The success and profitability of international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as:\n\u2022political or economic instability;\n\u2022changes in governmental regulation or taxation (foreign and domestic);\n\u2022currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022changes in import/export laws, regulations and customs and duties and tariffs (foreign and domestic);\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\n\u2022trade restrictions (foreign and domestic);\n\u2022difficulties of conducting business, managing operations, and costs of staffing in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions;\n\u2022taxes and other restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States;\n\u2022extended payment terms;\n\u2022seasonal reductions in business activity in some parts of the world; and\n\u2022natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, public health concerns (including health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other geopolitical uncertainties.\nIn addition, changes in policies and/or laws of the United States or foreign governments, including data privacy restrictions such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) resulting in, among other changes, higher taxation, tariffs or similar protectionist laws, currency conversion limitations, limitations on business operations, or the nationalization of private enterprises could reduce the anticipated benefits of international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, including intercompany transactions outside the United States, and we currently conduct limited hedging activities. In addition, some currencies may be subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies, which can limit the ability to otherwise react to rapid foreign currency devaluations. We cannot predict with precision the effect of future exchange-rate fluctuations, and significant rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational operations also expose us to currency fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign operations to U.S. dollars.\nA natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities could damage our business. We have warehouse and distribution facilities in the United States and Canada and in the United Kingdom and Germany. If the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged, or negatively impacted, by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence, we could utilize another distribution center or third-party distributors to ship products to our clients. However, this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our clients and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs. In addition, we operate numerous sales offices which may contain both business-critical data and confidential information of our clients. A natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of our major sales offices, including any closures or restrictions on operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Technology, Data and Intellectual Property\nDisruptions in our IT systems and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses. We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our clients. Our ability to provide that level of service is largely dependent on the ease of use, accuracy, quality and utilization of our IT systems, which impacts our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems, and the reliability of our voice and data networks and managed services offerings. If our current technology is determined to have a shorter economic life or the value of our current system is impaired, or necessary improvements to our technology are significantly delayed, we could incur additional expense and/or charges. The continuing development of our IT systems is crucial for our success. Accordingly, some of our IT systems are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the information systems. In addition, we recently migrated our EMEA operations to the same core IT systems and tools used in North America and APAC. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in these efforts at all times or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties. In addition, a substantial interruption in our IT systems or in our voice and data networks, however caused, could occur and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nCyberattacks, data incidents and breaches in the security (i) of our information systems and networks, (ii) of the products we sell and services we provide, and (iii) of the electronic and confidential information in our possession could materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and relationships with clients, partners, vendors, and teammates. We are dependent upon automated information technology processes. Privacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border commerce increases. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store or have access to certain proprietary confidential, and personal information, including information about teammates and information about partners, vendors, and clients which may be entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes. In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors and partners who assist us with certain aspects of our business. Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. The protection and security of our network systems, our clients\u2019 systems, applications, and platforms to which we have access, and our own information, as well as information relating to our clients, partners, vendors, and teammates, is vitally important to us as the compromise, loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access to such networks or information could lead to significant reputational or competitive harm, result in litigation involving us or our business partners, expose us to regulatory proceedings, and cause us to incur substantial liability or expenses.\nThe frequency, intensity, and sophistication of cyberattacks and data security incidents has significantly increased in recent years and is constant. As with many other businesses, we are continually subject to cyber-attacks and the risk of data security incidents. Due to the increased risk of these types of attacks and incidents, we expend significant resources on information technology and data security tools, measures, and processes designed to protect our networks systems, services, and the personal, confidential or proprietary information in our possession, and to ensure an effective response to any cyber-attack or data security incident. We have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to detect, prevent, and/or mitigate cyberattacks and data security incidents. Whether or not these policies, tools, and measures are ultimately successful, the expenditures could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and divert management\u2019s attention from pursuing our strategic objectives. As newer technologies evolve, and the portfolio of the service providers we share confidential information with grows, we could be exposed to increased risks from cyberattacks, data security events, and data breaches, including those from human error, negligence or mismanagement or from illegal or fraudulent acts.\nAlthough we take the security of our network systems and information seriously, there can be no assurance that the security measures we employ will effectively prevent unauthorized persons from obtaining unauthorized access to our systems and information due to the evolving nature and intensity of cyberattacks and threats to data security, in light of new and sophisticated tools and methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists to penetrate and compromise systems, including computer viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, which make it increasingly challenging to anticipate, harder to detect, and more difficult to adequately mitigate these risks. Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of our network systems and the proprietary, confidential, and personal data in our possession, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of proprietary, confidential and personal information, could result in costly investigations and remediation, business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our teammates\u2019, partners\u2019 and clients\u2019 confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Malicious individuals, organizations, and nation-state threat actors may attempt to penetrate or compromise our network systems, the products we sell, or services we provide in order to access, acquire, misappropriate, disclose, alter, or otherwise compromise our teammates\u2019, clients\u2019, and partners\u2019 proprietary, confidential, technical business, and/or personal information in our possession or to which we have access, create system disruptions, cause system or operations shutdowns or perpetrate secondary attacks against our clients, partners, and teammates. Such individuals or organizations also may develop or deploy viruses, worms, ransomware or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities of our systems or our product offerings, or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, clients or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our systems, data, or client environments. Cyberthreats, cyberattacks, data security incidents, data breaches, malware and similar disruptions from unauthorized access or tampering by malicious actors or inadvertent error could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data, resulting in the unauthorized access to, acquisition, misappropriation,\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\ndisclosure, alteration, or compromise of confidential, proprietary or technical business information or personal information and thereby could harm our reputation, client relationships, business, and competitive position.\nLike many other businesses, we have been, are, and expect to continue to be, subject to cyberattacks, and data security incidents. Additionally, some of the hardware and software products we resell could have defects, viruses, vulnerabilities, or otherwise be the subject of cyberattacks, data security events, or data breaches. We would consider the consequences of such attacks to be the responsibility of the respective manufacturers and publishers of such products, however, if such circumstances were to arise, we may be required to notify clients, regulators and individuals and thereby could be subject to litigation, regulatory inquiry, loss of business, and reputational harm.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, unpatented proprietary know-how, and patents, as well as confidentiality, invention assignment, non-solicitation and non-competition agreements. There can be no assurance that these measures will afford us sufficient protection of our intellectual property, and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. The disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our registered trademarks and trade names are subject to challenge by third parties. This may impact our ability to continue using those marks and names. Likewise, many businesses are actively investing in, developing and seeking protection for intellectual property in the areas of search, indexing, e-commerce and other Web-related technologies, as well as a variety of on-line business models and methods, all of which are in addition to traditional research and development efforts for IT products and application software, and non-practicing entities continue to invest in acquiring patent portfolios for the purpose of turning the portfolios into income-generating assets, whether through licensing campaigns or litigation. If there is a determination that we have infringed the proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial monetary liability, be forced to stop selling infringing products or providing infringing services, be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, if available, or be prevented from using the rights, which could force us to change our business practices or hardware, software or services offerings in the future. These types of claims and challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nWe are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and client audits and failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business, results of operations or cash flows. We are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, which include commercial, employment, tort and other litigation. Because of our significant sales to governmental entities, we also are subject to audits by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities in the ordinary course of our business. We also are subject to and currently engaged in audits by various vendor partners and large clients, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. In addition, we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts. Current and future litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome. Additionally, our operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including areas of labor and employment, advertising, e-commerce, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, data privacy requirements, including data privacy restrictions such as the GDPR or the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), data breach notification laws, and certain data security regulations, anti-competition, and environmental, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business, and the risk of noncompliance. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no guarantee against teammates, contractors, or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\nThe failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our commercial and public sector contracts could result in, among other things, damages, fines or other liabilities. Sales to commercial clients are based on stated contractual terms, the terms and conditions on our website or terms contained in purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis. Sales to public sector clients are derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental departments and agencies, as well as to educational institutions, through open market sales and various contracts and programs. Noncompliance with contract terms, or stated terms and conditions on our website, particularly to highly regulated public sector clients,\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nor with government procurement regulations and other requirements could result in fines or penalties against us or termination of contracts, and, in the public sector, could also result in civil, criminal, and administrative liability. With respect to our public sector clients, the government\u2019s remedies may include suspension or debarment. In addition, almost all of our contracts have default provisions, and substantially all of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency.\nChanges in, interpretations of, or enforcement trends related to tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective income tax rates or operating margins and we may be required to pay additional tax assessments. We conduct business globally and file tax returns in various U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022changes in pre-tax income in various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022increases in corporate tax rates and the availability of deductions or credits in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022changes in tax laws, regulations, and/or interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to U.S. federal and state regulations or interpretations;\n\u2022tax effects related to acquisition accounting; and\n\u2022resolutions of issues arising from tax examinations and any related interest or penalties.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation, judgment and complex calculations in situations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain. Our determination of tax liabilities is always subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have important consequences to our business. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had $361.6 million of total long-term debt outstanding, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), and an additional $311.9 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements. We also have the ability to borrow an additional $1.1 billion under our senior secured credit facility. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the following:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022requiring us to comply with restrictive covenants in our senior secured debt facility, which limits the manner in which we conduct our business;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less-leveraged competitors;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, which has been triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes continues to be triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, we would be required to settle the principal portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of Notes do not elect to convert their Notes, we would be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net current assets.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Call Spread Transactions. The option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of such option counterparties may default under the Call Spread Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If any option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the Call Spread Transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock.\nWe may face risk associated with the discontinuation of and transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark interest rate. We may face risk associated with the discontinuation of and transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark interest rate. We have outstanding U.S. Dollar denominated debt with variable interest rates based on LIBOR, and it is anticipated that LIBOR for all U.S. Dollar tenors will be discontinued as of the year ending 2023. The expected discontinuation of LIBOR for all U.S. Dollar tenors will require lenders and their borrowers to transition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark interest rate, which could have an impact on and risk to the Company if not completed in a timely manner. The Company\u2019s current material loan documents include an alternative benchmark interest rate for U.S. Dollars based initially on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. At this time, however, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates in the future. While various bodies, including governmental agencies, are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace LIBOR, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, there is uncertainty regarding which alternative reference rate will replace LIBOR. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact our contracts which terminate after 2023. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates in the future may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur acquisition strategy may increase our outstanding debt and interest expense and decrease the availability under our financing facilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To fund our acquisition initiatives, we increase our total borrowings from time to time, such as with the PCM acquisition. These additional borrowings have the effect of increasing our future interest expenses and require escalating amortization payments. Additionally, certain of our financing facilities have interest rates that vary based on market conditions and on utilization, which increases our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and may result in greater interest expense than we have forecasted.\nOur financing facilities contain covenants that we must comply with in order to avoid an occurrence of an event of default. The covenants include, among other things, limitations on the payment of dividends and compliance with certain minimum fixed charge ratio and minimum receivables requirements, as well as meeting monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. Our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants and to make scheduled payments on our financing facilities depends on our financial and operating performance. If we were unable to maintain compliance or to repay the borrowed amounts, the lenders under our financing facilities could declare an event of default and demand payment within a specified period of time.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly. Our operating results are highly dependent upon our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales, which fluctuates due to numerous factors, including changes in prices from partners, changes in the amount and timing of partner funding, volumes of purchases, changes in client mix, management of our cash conversion cycle, the relative mix of products and services sold during the period, general competitive conditions, and strategic product and services pricing and purchasing actions, some of which have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of significant price competition and our higher concentration of large enterprise clients, our gross margins are low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the future. Increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for certain IT products and services may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margins. These low gross margins magnify the impact of variations in revenue and operating costs on our operating results. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on anticipated net sales and the anticipated amount and timing of partner funding, and a portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed. Therefore, we may not be able to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected net sales shortfall, and we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to mitigate any further reductions in gross margins in the future. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure, our business, financial condition and results of\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\noperations could suffer. In addition, a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our partners could increase our need for and cost of working capital and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on certain key management personnel and our ability to attract, train and retain skilled teammates to satisfy client demand, including highly skilled technical resources with experience in key digital areas. We rely on key management to execute our strategy to grow profitable market share. The loss of one or more of these leaders, or a failure to attract and retain new executives, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified management, sales, service and technical teammates, and we make significant investments in the development of our leadership team, sales executives, solution architects, services engineers, project managers and other IT resources. If we are not able to retain such personnel or to train them quickly enough to meet changing market conditions, we could experience a drop in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales and services teammates, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, competition for skilled and non-skilled workers is intense and there are risks of sustained labor shortages in various regions. In some jurisdictions in which we operate, there is increasing demand for qualified resources to fill open positions. Our business has experienced and may continue to experience teammate attrition, which may cause us to incur increased costs to hire new teammates with the desired management and technical skills. Costs associated with recruiting, training and retaining teammates are significant. If we are unable to hire or deploy resources with the needed technical skill set or if we are unable to adequately equip our teammates with the skills needed, this could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to maintain an environment for teammates that is competitive and appealing, it could have an adverse effect on engagement and retention, and a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe acquisition, integration and operation of acquired businesses may disrupt our business and create additional expenses, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. In connection with our strategic initiatives, we regularly acquire new businesses to expand our technical capabilities, product and service offerings and client base and to realize cost savings. All acquisitions entail various risks such as difficulties in realizing the benefits of the acquired business, exposure to unexpected liabilities, difficulties in retaining key employees and adverse client reactions. In addition, integration of an acquired business involves numerous risks, including assimilation of operations of the acquired business and difficulties in the convergence of IT systems, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, risks of entering markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience, assumption of unknown or unquantifiable liabilities, the potential loss of key clients, difficulties assimilating and retaining teammates of those businesses into our culture and organizational structure, difficulties in completing strategic initiatives already underway in the acquired company, and unfamiliarity with partners of the acquired company, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The continued integration activities of the acquired businesses into our business is difficult and time consuming, and we may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies over the long term. We cannot assure that these risks or other unforeseen factors will not offset the intended benefits of the acquisitions, in whole or in part.\nFuture sales of the Company\u2019s common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock. In the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, restricted stock units, upon conversion of the Notes and in connection with the warrants to be issued in connection with the Call Spread Transactions. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or equity-linked securities, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities.", "PERMNO": 81220, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "NSIT"}
