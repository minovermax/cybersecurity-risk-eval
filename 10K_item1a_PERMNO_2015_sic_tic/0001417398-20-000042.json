{"cik": "1417398", "company": "Hillenbrand, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn this section of the Form 10-K, we describe the risks we believe are most important for you to think about when you consider investing in, selling, or owning securities. This information should be assessed along with the other information we provide you in this Form 10-K and that we file from time to time with the SEC. Like most companies, our business involves risks. The risks described below are not the only risks we face, but these are the ones we currently think have the potential to significantly affect stakeholders in our Company if they were to develop adversely (due to size, volatility, or both). We exclude risks that we believe are inherent in all businesses broadly as a function of simply being \u201cin business.\u201d As described herein, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business and financial results and may also have the effect of heightening many of the other\nrisks described in this section. Additional risks not currently known or considered immaterial by us at this time and thus not listed below could also result in adverse effects on our business.\n1.The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and the various government, industry and consumer actions related thereto, are having and are likely to continue to have negative impacts on our business and have created or could create or intensify adverse conditions described in our other risk factors. These impacts and conditions include, but are not limited to, potential significant volatility or decreases in demand for our products, changes in customer behavior and preferences, disruptions in or closures of our manufacturing operations or those of our customers and suppliers, disruptions within our supply chain, limitations on our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel, potential increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security due to widespread remote working arrangements, potential financial difficulties of customers and suppliers, significant changes in economic or political conditions, including rapidly changing government orders and regulations and our efforts to comply with them, and related financial and commodity volatility, including volatility in raw material and other input costs (including but not limited to oil prices), any of which could last for extended periods. Disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Company\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic could also increase the Company\u2019s exposure to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. For example, the continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts access to capital.\nDespite our efforts to manage through the current circumstances, the degree to which COVID-19 and related actions ultimately impact our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows may depend on certain factors beyond our control, including the duration, spread, and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain COVID-19 and mitigate its public health effects, the impact on the U.S. and global economies and demand for our products, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume or become impacted by long-lasting changes. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business, while likely to continue to be significant, cannot be predicted with certainty.\n2.We may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of Hillenbrand and Milacron and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nOn November 21, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Milacron. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of Hillenbrand and Milacron, which previously operated as independent public companies, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation opportunities, and operational efficiencies, in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier, and employee relations nor result in decreased revenue due to losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers. If the Company is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline.\nThe integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management\u2019s attention to the integration;\n\u2022managing a larger combined business;\n\u2022maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u2022retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n\u2022the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u2022consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations;\n\u2022coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems.\nSome of these factors are outside of the Company\u2019s control, including certain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic discussed elsewhere in our risk factors, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenue or synergies, and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the merger with Milacron and we expect to incur further expenses in order to integrate a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies, and systems of Milacron in connection with the merger.\n3.A key component of our growth strategy is making significant acquisitions, some of which may be outside the industries in which we currently operate. We may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from these acquisitions. If an acquisition were to perform unfavorably, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nAll acquisitions involve inherent uncertainties, which may include, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022successfully identify the most suitable targets for acquisition;\n\u2022negotiate reasonable terms;\n\u2022properly perform due diligence and determine all the significant risks associated with a particular acquisition;\n\u2022successfully integrate the acquired company into our business and achieve the desired performance;\n\u2022avoid diversion of Company management\u2019s attention from other important business activities; and\n\u2022where applicable, implement restructuring activities without an adverse impact to business operations.\nWe may acquire businesses with unknown liabilities, contingent liabilities, internal control deficiencies, or other risks. We have plans and procedures to review potential acquisition candidates for a variety of due diligence matters, including compliance with applicable regulations and laws prior to acquisition. Despite these efforts, realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position, or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.\nWe generally seek indemnification from sellers covering these matters; however, the liability of the sellers is often limited, and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot be assured that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of our acquisitions. Under such circumstances, management could be required to spend significant amounts of time and resources in the transition of the acquired business, and we may not fully realize benefits anticipated from application of the HOM. We may also decide to sell previously acquired businesses, or portions thereof, that no longer meet our strategic objectives, potentially resulting in a loss, accounting charge, or other negative impact. As a result of these factors, our business, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nIf we acquire a company that operates in an industry that is different from the ones in which we currently operate, our lack of experience with that company\u2019s industry could have a material adverse impact on our ability to manage that business and realize the benefits of that acquisition.\n4.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n5.Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, which are subject to periodic impairment evaluations, represent a significant portion of our total assets. An impairment charge on these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe acquired intangible assets with the acquisitions of Milacron, Coperion, K-Tron (including TerraSource Global), Rotex, Abel, Red Valve, and BM&M, portions of which were identified as either goodwill or indefinite-lived assets. We periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures, and market capitalization declines may impair these assets, and any of these factors may be increasingly present during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs required by applicable accounting standards, we review goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment either annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The risk of impairment to goodwill is higher during the early years following an acquisition. This is because the fair values of these assets align very closely with what we paid to acquire the reporting units to which these assets are assigned. As a result, the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its fair value (typically referred to as \u201cheadroom\u201d) is smaller at the time of acquisition. Until this headroom grows over time, due to business growth or lower carrying value of the reporting unit, a relatively small decrease in reporting unit fair value can trigger impairment charges. When impairment charges are triggered, they tend to be material due to the size of the assets involved. The recency and relative size of the Milacron acquisition have elevated and could further elevate the risk of such impairment charges, including material impairment charges. Future acquisitions could present the same risks.\nAny charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.\n6.The performance of the Company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology, cyber-attacks, or catastrophic losses affecting infrastructure.\nThe Company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions. Computer systems are important to production planning, customer service, and order management, as well as other critical processes.\nDespite efforts to prevent such situations and the existence of established risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks, the Company\u2019s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from, among other causes, power outages, system failures, or computer viruses. Computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations, such as email, telephone and other functionality, is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various geographies in which the Company operates.\nIn addition, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the Company\u2019s information technology systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. Cyber-attacks, security breaches, and other cyber incidents could include, among other things, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and other attacks. These risks may be heightened given our employees\u2019 increased use of remote working environments in response the COVID-19 pandemic. Sensitive information is also stored by our vendors and on the platforms and networks of third-party providers. Cyber-attacks on the Company, our vendors, or our third-party providers could result in inappropriate access to intellectual property, personally identifiable information of our global workforce, suppliers, or customers, or personal credit card or other payment information of our customers. Potential consequences of a successful cyber-attack or other cybersecurity incident include remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack, litigation and legal risks including governmental or regulatory enforcement actions, increased insurance premiums, reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence, and damage to the Company\u2019s competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value. While we have taken steps to maintain and enhance the appropriate cybersecurity and address these risks by implementing enhanced security technologies, internal controls, and business continuity plans, these measures may not be adequate.\nRegulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations. For example, the European Union and other jurisdictions, including some U.S. states, have enacted, and others may enact, new and expanded sets of compliance requirements on companies, like ours, that collect or process personal data. Failure to comply with these or other data protection regulations could expose us to potentially significant liabilities. If the Company suffers a loss or disclosure of protected information due to security breaches or other reasons, and if business continuity plans do not effectively address these issues on a timely basis, the Company may incur fines or penalties, or suffer interruption in its ability to manage\noperations, as well as reputational, competitive, or business harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n7.We operate in highly competitive industries, many of which are currently subject to intense price competition, and if we are unable to compete successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMany of the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Our products may not compete successfully with those of our competitors. The markets for plastic processing equipment and related products, material handling equipment, complete equipment systems, mold components, burial caskets, and minerals and mining equipment, are highly competitive and include a number of North American, European, and Asian competitors. Principal competitive factors in the plastic processing industry, material handling equipment, and complete equipment systems include price, lead time, product features, technology, total cost of ownership, performance, reliability, quality, delivery, and customer service. Principal competitive factors in the mold components industry include technology, price, quality, performance, and delivery. Principal competitive factors in the burial caskets industry include product, price, quality, delivery, and customer service. Principal competitive factors in the minerals and mining industry include product features, performance, price, delivery, and customer service.\nOur competitors may be positioned to offer more favorable pricing to customers, resulting in reduced volume and profitability. In certain cases, we have lost business to competitors who offered prices lower than ours. Competition may also limit our ability to pass on the effects of increases in our cost structure. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and less debt than we do, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage in the future. These competitors may be better able to withstand and respond to changes in conditions within our industry.\nCompetition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes, reduced prices, and increased costs of manufacturing, distributing and selling our products.\n8.We derive significant revenue from the plastics industry. Decrease in demand for base resin or engineering plastics or equipment used in the production of these products, or changes in technological advances, or changes in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe majority of Molding Technology Solutions\u2019 sales are realized from the manufacture, distribution, and service of highly engineered and customized systems within the plastic technology and processing market. Advanced Process Solutions sells equipment, including highly engineered extruders, feeders, and conveying systems, to the plastics industry for the production of base resins, durable engineering grade plastics, and other compounded plastics (including bioplastics and recycled plastic product). Sales volume is dependent upon the need for equipment used to produce these products, which may be significantly influenced by the demand for plastics, the capital investment needs of companies in the plastics industry, changes in technological advances, or changes in laws or regulations such as, but not limited to, those related to single-use plastics and recycling. Unfavorable developments in the plastics industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n9.We rely upon our employees, agents, and business partners to comply with laws in many different countries and jurisdictions. We establish policies and provide training to assist them in understanding our policies and the regulations most applicable to our business; however, our reputation, ability to do business, and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by these parties.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback, false claims, competition, export and import compliance, including the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations, trade sanctions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), anti-money laundering, and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries, including us, from making improper payments to government officials or other parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree. Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of various governments and regulatory agencies outside of the U.S., which may bring our personnel into contact with foreign officials responsible for issuing or renewing permits, licenses or approvals or for enforcing other governmental regulations. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. Our global operations expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, the foregoing or other anti-corruption laws. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions; could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary, and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits; could cause us to incur significant legal fees; and could damage our reputation.\n10.We have a significant amount of debt, which could adversely affect the Company and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or make future desirable acquisitions.\nAs of September 30, 2020, our outstanding debt was $1,552.6. The amount of debt could increase if additional levels of liquidity are needed, including as a result of conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This level of debt (and additional debt we may incur after that date) has important consequences to our businesses. For example:\n\u2022We may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, because we have lower borrowing capacity.\n\u2022We may be required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts and acquisitions, working capital requirements, and capital expenditures.\n\u2022We will continue to be exposed to the risk of increased interest rates, because a portion of our borrowings is at variable rates of interest.\n\u2022We may be more limited in our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which they operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness.\n\u2022We may be more vulnerable to credit rating downgrades which could have an impact on our ability to secure future financing at attractive interest rates.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated economic impact, our credit rating was downgraded by Moody\u2019s, S&P Global, and Fitch, and we may be vulnerable to additional downgrades. This downgrade and/or additional downgrades could have an impact on our ability to secure future financing on terms commercially acceptable to us, to access the credit and capital markets, or to negotiate favorable covenants in any future amendments to our financial documents or new financings.\nWhile we have publicly stated that we will seek to deleverage our business, there can be no assurances that we will successfully achieve our deleveraging targets within our anticipated timeline or at all, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business and cash flows. In order to achieve our targeted leverage ratios, we currently plan to curtail material acquisitions and share repurchases, and as a result, may forego opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to the Company. Additionally, at any time and from time to time, we may evaluate or pursue one or more strategic options, including potential sale transactions. There can be no assurances if or when the Company would enter into any such transaction or the terms thereof or whether any such transaction would result in the Company achieving its desired leverage targets. The failure to achieve such deleveraging targets could result in a negative impact to the Company\u2019s credit ratings, impair its ability to raise future indebtedness, or otherwise adversely impact its operating or financial condition or performance.\n11.If we are unable to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements, our business, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Credit Agreement, the L/G Facility Agreement, and the Shelf Agreement contain financial and other restrictive covenants. These covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our financial and operating flexibility as well as our ability to plan for and react to market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business, and to meet our capital needs. Our failure to comply with these covenants, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business, could result in events of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay indebtedness before its due date, and we may not have the financial resources or be able to arrange alternative financing to do so. Any event that requires us to repay any of our debt before it is due could require us to borrow additional amounts at unfavorable borrowing terms, cause a significant reduction in our liquidity, and impair our ability to pay amounts due on our indebtedness. Moreover, if we are required to repay any of our debt before it becomes due, we may be unable to borrow additional amounts or otherwise obtain the cash necessary to repay that additional debt when due, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity. Furthermore, the current market volatility and economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the rates at which we are able to borrow and our ability to borrow under the Revolver or any other credit facility in the future, or pursuant to other available sources. In addition, in light of the impacts to our ability to generate cash from operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, our results may be further negatively impacted by our payment obligations (including interest) with respect to our outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and our other credit agreements.\n12.Global market and economic conditions, including those related to the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Continuing uncertainties in the eurozone, including the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, future implications from the voluntary exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and uncertainties in China and emerging markets may depress demand in these areas and create additional risk to our financial results.\nInstability in the global economy and financial markets can adversely affect our business in several ways, including limiting our customers\u2019 ability to obtain sufficient credit or pay for our products within the terms of sale. Competition could further intensify among the manufacturers and distributors with whom we compete for volume and market share, resulting in lower net revenue due to steeper discounts and product mix-down. In particular, if certain key or sole suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies.\nSubstantial losses in the equity markets could have an adverse effect on the assets of the Company\u2019s pension plans. Volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns could require greater contributions to the defined benefit plans in the future.\n13.International economic, political, legal, and business factors could negatively affect our operating results, cash flows, financial condition, and growth.\nWe derived approximately 53%, 51%, and 48% of our net revenue from our operations outside the U.S. for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. This net revenue is primarily generated in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, South America, and Canada. In addition, we have manufacturing operations, suppliers, and employees located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S., we expect to continue to increase our revenue and presence outside the U.S., including in emerging markets.\nOur international business is subject to risks that are often encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:\n\u2022interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers, including conditions where recovery from natural disasters may be delayed due to country-specific infrastructure and resources;\n\u2022differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;\n\u2022local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic condition, including with respect to safety and health issues;\n\u2022trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including unfavorable changes with respect to tax, trade, or sanctions compliance matters;\n\u2022limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022differing labor regulations;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing contract and property rights under local law;\n\u2022difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and\n\u2022differing protection of intellectual property.\nSuch risks may be more likely or pronounced in emerging markets, where our operations may be subject to greater uncertainty due to increased volatility associated with the developing nature of their economic, legal, and governmental systems.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n14.We operate in cyclical industries.\nAs an industrial capital goods supplier, we serve industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as packaging, automotive, construction, consumer goods, electronics, chemicals, and plastics industries. The performance of many of our businesses is directly related to the production levels of our customers. In particular, prices for plastic resins used to make plastic products and parts tend to fluctuate to a greater degree than our customers can adjust for in the pricing of their products. When resin prices increase, certain of our customers\u2019 profit margins decrease, which may result in lower demand for our products. Therefore, our business is affected by fluctuations in the price of resin, which could have an adverse effect on our business and ability to generate operating cash flows.\nDuring periods of economic expansion, when capital spending normally increases, the Advanced Process Solutions and Molding Technology Solutions reportable segments generally benefit from greater demand for their products. During periods of economic contraction, such as during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, when capital spending normally decreases, Advanced Process Solutions and Molding Technology Solutions reportable segments generally are adversely affected by declining demand for new equipment orders, and may be subject to increases in uncollectible receivables from customers who become insolvent. There can be no assurance that economic expansion or increased demand will be sustainable, and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n15.Continued fluctuations in mortality rates and increased cremations may adversely affect the sales volume of our burial caskets.\nThe life expectancy of U.S. citizens has increased since the 1950s. However, we do anticipate a modest increase in deaths for the foreseeable future driven by the aging U.S. population. Cremations as a percentage of total U.S. deaths have increased steadily since the 1960s and are expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. The increase in the number of cremations in the U.S. has resulted in a contraction in the demand for burial caskets. This has been a contributing factor to lower burial casket sales volumes for Batesville in recent years. We expect these trends will continue in the foreseeable future and will likely continue to negatively impact burial casket volumes. If cremations as a percentage of total U.S. deaths increase at an accelerated pace, the demand for burial caskets could further contract.\nIn addition, the number of deaths can vary over short periods of time and among different geographical areas due to a variety of factors, including the timing and severity of seasonal outbreaks of illnesses such as pneumonia and influenza. Such variations could cause the sale of burial caskets and cremation products to fluctuate, or more rapidly decrease, from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n16.Batesville\u2019s business is dependent on several major contracts with large national funeral providers. The relationships with these customers pose several risks.\nBatesville has contracts with a number of national funeral home customers that constitute a sizeable portion of its overall sales volume. Also, while contracts with national funeral service providers give Batesville important access to purchasers of death care products, they may obligate Batesville to sell products at contracted prices for extended periods of time, therefore limiting Batesville\u2019s ability, in the short or medium term, to raise prices in response to significant increases in raw material prices or other factors. Any decision by national funeral home customers to discontinue or limit purchases from Batesville could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n17.Batesville is facing competition from caskets manufactured abroad and imported into North America and from a number of non-traditional sources.\nSome foreign casket manufacturers, mostly from China, import caskets into the U.S. and Canada. In addition, non-traditional death care product providers, such as large discount retail stores, casket stores, and internet casket retailers could present more of a competitive threat to Batesville and its sales channel than is currently anticipated. Sales from these foreign and non-traditional providers are estimated to represent less than 10% of total casket sales in North America, but this percentage could grow. It is not possible to quantify the financial impact that these competitors will have on Batesville in the future. These competitors and any new entrants into the funeral products business may drive pricing and other competitive actions in an industry that already has domestic production over-capacity. Such competitive developments could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\n18.The effective tax rate of the Company may be negatively impacted by changes in the mix of earnings as well as future changes to tax laws in global jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various other global jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, or if there is a change to the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a material increase in our effective tax rate.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could have a material impact on our effective tax rate. Many countries in the European Union, as well as several other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Certain proposals could include recommendations that could increase our tax obligations in those countries where we do business. Any changes in the taxation of our activities in such jurisdictions may result in a material increase in our effective tax rate.\n19.We are exposed to a number of different tax uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are required to pay taxes in multiple jurisdictions. We determine the tax liability we are required to pay based on our interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We may be subject to unfavorable changes, including retroactive changes, in the tax laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nWe are subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the United States and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions, which are inherently uncertain. Negative or unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations. Tax controls and changes in tax laws or regulations or the interpretation given to them may expose us to negative tax consequences, including interest payments and potential penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n20.We are involved from time to time in claims, lawsuits, and governmental proceedings relating to our operations, including environmental, antitrust, patent infringement, business practices, commercial transactions, and other matters. The ultimate outcome of these claims, lawsuits, and governmental proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty but could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to other potential claims, including product and general liability, workers compensation, auto liability, and employment-related matters. While we maintain insurance for certain of these exposures, the policies in place are often high-deductible policies. It is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation or other potential claims, and the ultimate outcome of claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For a more detailed discussion of claims, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statement included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\n21.Uncertainty in the United States political environment could negatively impact our business.\nThe political environment in the United States, particularly surrounding the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, has created significant uncertainty with respect to, and could result in additional changes in, or potential gridlock hindering legislation (including additional COVID-19 stimulus relief), regulation, international relations, and government policy, or possible civil unrest or other disturbances in connection with the election outcomes. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such additional changes or disturbances could occur, any such events, including at the local, state or federal level, could significantly impact our business and the industries in which we compete. To the extent such disturbances or changes in the political or regulatory environment have a negative impact on the Company or the markets in which we operate, it may materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the periods to come.\n22.Uncertainty in the United States global trade policy could negatively impact our business.\nThe U.S. government has at times indicated a willingness to significantly change, and has in some cases significantly changed, trade policies and/or agreements. Specific legislative and regulatory developments and proposals that could have a material impact on us involve matters including (but not limited to) changes to existing trade agreements or entry into new trade agreements, sanctions policies, import and export regulations, tariffs, taxes and customs duties, public company reporting requirements, environmental regulation, and antitrust enforcement. In addition, certain countries that are central to our businesses have imposed and/or been subject to imposition or have threatened imposition of retaliatory tariffs in response to tariffs imposed by the U.S. upon various raw materials and finished goods, including steel and others that are important to our businesses. This exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our raw materials, and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins. Changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships or agreements, or tax law could reduce the supply of goods available to us or increase our cost of goods. Although such changes would in many cases have implications across the entire industry, we may fail to effectively adapt to and manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes. In addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business opportunities or fail to effectively adapt our\nbusiness strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes. These risks could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the periods to come.\nFurther, the level of impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and the reactions of governmental authorities and others thereto may have significant adverse effects on international trade policy and the impact of any changes in international trade policy on the economy or on the businesses of the Company and those of its customers and its suppliers remains uncertain.\n23.We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue. In addition, since our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. The Company\u2019s predominant exposures are the Euro, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Mexican peso, Chinese Renminbi, and Indian Rupee (along with others to a lesser degree). In preparing financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using weighted-average exchange rates. With respect to the effects on translated earnings, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, the Company\u2019s earnings could be negatively impacted. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.\n24.Increased prices for, poor quality of, or extended inability to source raw materials or services used in our products could adversely affect profitability.\nOur profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. These prices fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel-related delivery costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates, and, in some cases, government regulation. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials that cannot be recovered through increases in the price of our products could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot guarantee that the prices we are paying for raw materials today will continue in the future or that the marketplace will continue to support current prices for our products or that such prices can be adjusted to fully or partially offset raw material price increases in the future. Any increases in prices resulting from a tightening supply of these or other commodities could adversely affect our profitability. We do not engage in hedging transactions for raw material purchases, but we do enter into some fixed-price supply contracts.\nOur dependency upon regular deliveries of supplies and the quality of those supplies upon delivery from particular suppliers means that interruptions, stoppages, or deterioration of quality in such deliveries could adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers could be made. Several of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products currently are procured from a single source. In some cases, we also outsource certain services to suppliers, including but not limited to, engineering, assembly, shipping, and commissioning services. If a supplier were unable to deliver these materials or services, or unable to deliver quality materials or services, for an extended period of time as a result of financial difficulties, catastrophic events affecting their facilities, or other factors, or if we were unable to negotiate acceptable terms for the supply of materials or services with these suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. We may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs. Extended inability to source a necessary raw material or service could cause us to cease manufacturing one or more products for a period of time, which could also lead to loss of customers, as well as reputational, competitive, or business harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n25.The Company could face labor disruptions that would interfere with operations.\nAs of September 30, 2020 and 2019, approximately 26% and 43%, respectively, of Hillenbrand\u2019s employees work under collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Although we have not experienced any significant work stoppages in the past 20 years as a result of labor disagreements, we cannot ensure that such a stoppage will not occur in the future. Inability to negotiate satisfactory new agreements or a labor disturbance at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n26.Increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers could adversely affect our business.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a skilled workforce. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on a thoroughly trained and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineers. In many of the geographies where we operate, we face a potential shortage of qualified employees. The increasing competition for highly skilled and talented employees could result in higher compensation costs, difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce, and leadership succession planning challenges. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n27.Provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and facets of Indiana law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, as well as Indiana law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of our shareholders. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our Company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable our Board of Directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that the Board of Directors believes is not in the best interests of shareholders, but which some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests.\nThese provisions include, among others:\n\u2022the division of our Board of Directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022the inability of our shareholders to act by less than unanimous written consent;\n\u2022rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors.\nIndiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe believe these provisions are important for a public company and protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise potentially unfair takeover tactics by encouraging potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with appropriate time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make our Company immune from takeovers; however, they may apply if the Board of Directors determines that a takeover offer is not in the best interests of our shareholders, even if some shareholders believe the offer to be beneficial.", "PERMNO": 92597, "SIC": 3530, "TIC": "HI"}
