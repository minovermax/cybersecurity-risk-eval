{"cik": "23197", "company": "COMTECH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-10-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following describes major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur fiscal 2017 business outlook, which now includes our assumptions related to the TCS business, is difficult to forecast and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and are likely to be volatile.\nOur new orders, net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors including: sales mix; fluctuating market demand; price competition; new product introductions by our competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unexpected changes in the timing of delivery of components or subsystems; the financial performance of acquisitions; new accounting standards relating to acquisitions and revenue recognition; political instability; regulatory developments; changes in income tax rates or tax credits; the price and expected volatility of our stock (which will impact, among other items, the amount of stock-based compensation expense we may record); and general global economic conditions.\nWe have experienced, and will experience in the future, significant fluctuations in new orders, net sales and operating results from period to period. A large portion of our Commercial Solutions segment net sales are derived from products such as satellite earth station equipment and certain traveling wave tube amplifier products that generally have short lead times. As a result, bookings and backlog related to these products are extremely sensitive to short-term fluctuations in customer demand.\nA large portion of our Government Solutions segment net sales are derived in part from large U.S. Government programs or large foreign government opportunities that are subject to lengthy sales cycles and are therefore difficult to predict.\nOn February 23, 2016, we completed the acquisition of TCS. Pursuant to accounting rules, the acquisition of TCS is expected to result in a material increase in annual amortization expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 related to intangibles and possible other fair value adjustments. We have completed a preliminary analysis of such amortization expense but have not yet finalized our analysis of these fair value adjustments. Additionally, our ability to accurately forecast future performance will be dependent upon our ability to fully familiarize ourselves with the variability of the business and environment in which TCS operates.\nOur fiscal 2016 operating results were and our fiscal 2017 operating results, to a lesser extent, are expected to be impacted by approximately $48.0 million of expenditures relating to the acquisition of TCS. Additional unanticipated acquisition-related costs may be incurred.\nThe continued effects of the adverse global economic climate and volatile political conditions have had and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business outlook and our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor the past several years, many of the end-markets for our products and services have been significantly impacted by adverse global economic conditions. For example, many of our international end-customers are located in emerging and developing countries that are undergoing sweeping economic and political changes. Many governments around the world have also cut their spending budgets and are under pressure to further reduce them. In recent years global oil and natural gas prices plunged, significantly impairing the ability of our customers in the oil and gas producing regions of the world to invest in telecommunications products and infrastructure. Additionally, the U.S. dollar strengthened against many international currencies, resulting in lower purchasing power for many of our international end-customers because virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We generate significant sales from Brazil, Russia, India and China as well as other emerging and developing countries. Political conditions around the world are unstable and current and potential future economic sanctions could be imposed on some of our end-customers which could adversely impact our sales. Global international monetary issues and concerns continue to be unsettled and it remains possible that another worldwide credit crisis or recession could occur.\nWe believe that the aggregation of adverse global economic conditions has resulted in the ongoing suppression of end-market demand for many of the products that we sell and services that we provide. We believe that nearly all of our customers are challenged by capital and operating budget constraints and a difficult credit environment. The impact, severity and duration of these conditions are impossible to predict with precision. Many of our international customers (including our Middle Eastern and African customers) rely on European bank financing to procure funding for large systems, many of which include our equipment. We believe that European financing has been and continues to be difficult to obtain. Volatility of interest rates may cause our customers to be reluctant to spend funds required to purchase our equipment or projects could be postponed or canceled.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and the U.K.\u2019s future relationships with European Union member states. Adverse consequences concerning Brexit or the European Union could include deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.\nOur overall business has not been immune from these adverse conditions and we face an uncertain economic environment. These adverse conditions have impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nDifficulty in forecasting our results of operations - It is difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations as we cannot predict the severity or the duration of the current adverse economic environment or the impact it will have on our current and prospective customers. If our current or prospective customers materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we anticipate, our business outlook will prove to be inaccurate.\n\u2022\nAdditional reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may occur - Our businesses have been negatively affected by uncertain economic environments in the overall market and, more specifically, in the telecommunications sector. Our customers have reduced their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems and in some cases postponed or reduced the purchase of our products and systems. As a result of the ongoing difficult global economic environment, our customers may reduce their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems which would negatively impact both of our reporting operating segments. If this occurs, it would adversely affect our business outlook, net sales, profitability and the recoverability of our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill.\n\u2022\nOur customers may not be able to obtain financing - Although many of our products are relatively inexpensive when compared to the total systems or networks that they are incorporated into, our sales are affected by our customers' ability to obtain the financing they may require to build out their total systems or networks and fund ongoing operations. Many of our emerging market customers obtain financing for network build-outs from European commercial banks and/or governments. Our customers' inability to obtain sufficient financing would adversely affect our net sales. In addition, if the current economic environment and lack of financing results in insolvencies for our customers, it would adversely impact the recoverability of our accounts receivable which would, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisition of TCS and related merger and integration activity may divert our resources and management attention.\nThe acquisition of TCS has a number of unique risks, including:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to manage organizational changes associated with the TCS acquisition - As of February 1, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of TCS, we reorganized our business into two reporting operating segments: Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions. We may further change our business and organizational structure and streamline and further consolidate certain business processes to achieve greater operating efficiencies. We will face operational and administrative challenges as we work to integrate TCS's operations into our business. In particular, the acquisition of TCS has significantly expanded the types of products and services that we sell, expanded the businesses in which we engage, and increased the number of facilities we operate, thereby presenting us with significant challenges in managing the substantial increase in scale of our business. These challenges include the integration of a large number of systems, both operational and administrative. We may not be able to successfully manage these organizational changes and the unanticipated disruption to our business that might result from these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention to these matters and away from other business concerns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe may not realize the benefits of merger integration costs - Although we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of the acquisition of TCS, we cannot provide assurance that such benefits will be achieved at all or, if achieved, to what extent. In particular, the success of the acquisition of TCS depends, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated efficiencies and cost savings, primarily through the elimination of redundant functions and the integration of certain operations. No assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve these efficiencies and cost savings within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\n\u2022\nWe may experience a loss or adverse effect on customer relationships - The acquisition of TCS may adversely affect the relationships that the combined company has with its customers, service providers and employees. As a result of the acquisition, we may experience a loss of, or changes to, TCS\u2019s relationships with its customers or Comtech\u2019s legacy customers, which could negatively impact our business outlook. Our future growth depends in part on expanding relationships with key distribution channels for TCS products such as Next Generation 911 solutions. If we are unable to capitalize on those relationships or if we lose existing relationships, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain personnel could adversely affect our future business, operations and financial results.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our ability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel, particularly in sales and marketing and research and development. If we are unable to do so, our business could be harmed.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness under a Secured Credit Facility, and may not be able in the future to service that debt.\nIn connection with the acquisition of TCS, we entered into a Secured Credit Facility which provides for borrowing availability of up to $400.0 million. As of July 31, 2016, we had approximately $256.5 million of borrowings under the Secured Credit Facility of which $172.6 million is from a $250.0 million Term Loan A and $83.9 million of drawings under a revolving credit line. The Secured Credit Facility requires interim payments and payment in full by February 23, 2021. If we do not have sufficient funds to repay our debt when due, it may be necessary to refinance our debt through additional debt or equity financings. If, at the time of any refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates on such refinancing, increases in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. If we are unable to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses, as we have pledged substantially all of our assets to the lenders as security for our payment obligations.\nOur Secured Credit Facility contains various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and, as a result, reduce our profitability.\nOur Secured Credit Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our ability to, among other things, permit liens on our property, change the nature of our business, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person. In addition, the agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios such as a maximum net leverage ratio of 2.75x Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Secured Credit Facility) by the end of our fiscal 2017. Even if we achieve expected financial results in fiscal 2017, it is possible that we may not be able to meet such covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations.\nOur substantial debt obligations could impede, restrict or delay the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. For example:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes, including business development efforts, capital expenditures, dividends or strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022\nif we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may have to take actions such as selling assets or raising additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures, or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to fund future working capital, capital investments and other business activities;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to pay dividends or make certain other distributions;\n\u2022\nwe may become more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or a worsening of general economic or industry-specific conditions; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nFuture acquisitions of companies and investments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value or adversely affect operating results or the market price of our common stock.\nWe expect to continue to consider future acquisitions and investments as part of our growth plans. Future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, incurrence of large amounts of debt, increases to amortization expense and future write-offs of intangibles acquired. Acquisitions and investments involve risks that include failing to:\n\u2022\nproperly evaluate the technology;\n\u2022\naccurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses;\n\u2022\nintegrate the technologies, products and services, research and development, sales and marketing, support and other operations;\n\u2022\nintegrate and retain key management personnel and other key employees;\n\u2022\nretain and cross-sell to acquired customers; and\n\u2022\ncombine potentially different corporate cultures.\nAcquisitions and investments could also:\n\u2022\ndivert management\u2019s attention away from the operation of our businesses;\n\u2022\nresult in significant goodwill and intangibles write-offs in the event an acquisition or investment does not meet expectations; and\n\u2022\nincrease expenses, including expenses of managing the growth of such acquired businesses.\nThere can be no assurance that any future acquisition or investment will be successful within the anticipated time frame, or at all, will be as valuable as the amount we eventually pay to acquire it, and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if we consummate future acquisitions using our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is highly dependent on the budgetary decisions of our government customers, including the U.S. government (including prime contractors to the U.S. government), and changes in the U.S. government\u2019s fiscal policies or budgetary priorities may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring our fiscal years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government) were $167.5 million, $94.0 million and $97.3 million or 40.8%, 30.6% and 28.0% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. Following the TCS acquisition, we expect that our sales to the U.S. government will increase as a percentage of total sales. A large portion of our existing backlog consisted of orders related to U.S. government contracts and our business outlook for fiscal 2017 and beyond depends, in part, on new orders from the U.S. government, which is currently under extreme budgetary pressures.\nWe rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on our communication solutions, and our backlog depends in large part on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we participate. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of spending. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and Congress\u2019s failure to appropriate funds, or Congress\u2019s actions to delay spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, U.S. government programs which we participate in, could negatively affect our results of operations. Because many of the items we sell to the U.S. government are included in large programs realized over a period of several years, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine specific amounts that are or will be appropriated for our products and services. As such, our assessments relating to the impact of changes in U.S. government spending may prove to be incorrect.\nThe impact of a legislation process known as sequestration (or mandated reductions) remains a significant risk. Part I of the Budget Control Act of 2011 provided for a reduction in planned defense budgets by at least $487 billion over a ten year period. A two-year budget agreement set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 lessened the across-the-board cuts of sequestration; however, sequestration continues to be in effect, including for the U.S. Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security. Sequestration has already negatively affected some of the defense programs in which we participate and we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by the continuing effects of sequestration or other defense spending delays and cuts.\nThe federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular. The failure of Congress to approve future budgets and/or increase the debt ceiling of the U.S. on a timely basis could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. A decrease in Department of Defense or Department of Homeland Security expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how budget reductions will be applied and what challenges the reductions will present.\nUltimately the U.S. government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities. If the U.S. government budget process results in a prolonged shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, we may experience delayed orders, delayed payments and declines in net sales, profitability and cash flows. We may experience related supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors. All of the aforementioned conditions and factors could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Additionally, cost cutting, efficiency initiatives, reprioritization, other affordability analyses, and changes in budgetary priorities by our governmental customers, including the U.S. government, could adversely impact our Government Solutions segment. We are unable to predict the impact these or similar events could have on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks.\nWe depend on the U.S. government for a significant portion of our revenues. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique business and commercial risks, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions;\n\u2022\nunpredictable order placements, reductions, delays or cancellations;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed-price; and\n\u2022\nunpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures, including government audit and approval of final indirect rates.\nAll of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience or upon an event of default by us. Termination for convenience provisions provide us with little to no recourse: our potential recovery of costs incurred or costs committed, potential settlement expenses and hypothetical profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the U.S. government\u2019s right to terminate, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary funding. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract may not be fully funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if, and when, appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of awards or lead to changes in program content. We obtain certain of our U.S. government contracts through a competitive bidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win additional contracts or that actual contracts that are awarded will ultimately be profitable.\nIn addition, we could be disqualified as a supplier to the U.S. government. As a supplier to the U.S. government, we must comply with numerous regulations, including those governing security, contracting practices and classified information. Failure to comply with these regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on, or for award of, new government contracts. If we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies, we would lose most, if not all, of our U.S. government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly.\nOur contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits that could result in penalties and a reduction in contract value.\nAll of our U.S. government contracts can be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\") and other U.S. government agencies and we can be subject to penalties arising from post-award contract audits (sometimes referred to as a Truth in Negotiations Act or \"TINA\" audit) or cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced. If costs are found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract, those costs will not be reimbursed, and any such costs already reimbursed would be required to be refunded. Although we record contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize upon final audit, we cannot predict the outcome of any such future audits and adjustments and we may be required to materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.\nOur dependence on sales to international customers exposes us to risks.\nSales for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) represented approximately 30.0%, 56.2% and 59.4% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future. These sales expose us to certain risks, including barriers to trade, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which may make our products less price-competitive), political and economic instability, exposure to public health epidemics, availability of suitable export financing, tariff regulations, and other U.S. and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products. Although we take steps to mitigate our risk with respect to international sales, we may not be able to do so in every instance for any of the following reasons, among others:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to continue to structure our international contracts to reduce risk - We attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers, contracts denominated in U.S. dollars, advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor. However, we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries in all instances. In such cases, billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectability risk and may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government.\n\u2022\nWe rely on a limited number of international sales agents - In some countries, we rely upon one or a small number of sales agents, exposing us to risks relating to our contracts with, and related performance of, those agents. We attempt to reduce our risk with respect to sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices where it is practical and by engaging, where practicable, more than one independent sales representative in a territory. It is our policy to require all sales agents to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Violations of any of these laws, rules or regulations, and other business practices that are regarded as unethical, could interrupt the sales of our products and services, result in the cancellation of orders or the termination of customer relationships, and could damage our reputation, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe currently price virtually all of our products in U.S. dollars - Today, virtually all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Over the last few years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly against many international currencies. As such, many of our international customers experienced a drop in their purchasing power as it relates to their ability to purchase our products. To date, we have not materially changed our selling prices and have experienced lower sales volumes. It is possible, that the strength in the U.S. dollar will continue or that it will further increase against many international currencies. If this occurs, our customers may reduce their spending or postpone purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses, and such failure would materially adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need a license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected.\nU.S. laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the IEEPA, the ITAR, the EAR and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (\"OFAC\"). In addition, we are subject to the FCPA and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, which generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or subsidiaries will not violate our policies. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we have conducted virtually no business with states designated as sponsors of terrorism. In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the DDTC and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance and maintain certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance.\nIn October 2014, we self-disclosed to OFAC that we learned during a routine assessment of the adequacy of our export control compliance procedures that we had inadvertently neglected to obtain an OFAC license for a shipment of modems to a Canadian customer who, we learned after the transaction had begun, intended to incorporate our modems in a communication system the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority. OFAC regulations prohibit U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly in Sudan and from facilitating transactions by non-U.S. persons which would be illegal if done by a U.S. person. In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena to us seeking further information about the previously voluntarily disclosed transaction and any other transactions involving Sudan. We have responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech\u2019s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon after which time the modems were rerouted to Sudan without Comtech\u2019s knowledge.\nOFAC has not responded to our submission of further information and we cannot predict when the agency will complete its review and determine whether any violations occurred. While OFAC could decide not to impose penalties and only issue a no action or cautionary letter, we could face civil and criminal penalties and may suffer reputational harm if we are found to have violated U.S. sanctions laws. Even though we take precautions to prevent transactions with U.S. sanctions targets, any such measures, or any new measures we may implement in the future, may be ineffective. As a result, there is risk that in the future we could provide our products to or permit our products to be downloaded or accessed by such targets despite these precautions. This could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.\nWe continue to implement policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. In the future, we may be subjected to compliance audits in the future that may uncover improper or illegal activities that would subject us to material remediation costs, civil and criminal fines and/or penalties and/or an injunction. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these outcomes could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries, the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country. If we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in those countries could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOur investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, further deterioration of the global economy or if we change our reporting unit structure.\nAs of July 31, 2016, goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $287.6 million. Additionally, as of July 31, 2016, net intangibles recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet aggregated $284.7 million. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\" we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the required Step One test as described in FASB ASC 350, we would do a Step Two test which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nIt is possible that, during future financial periods, business conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could deteriorate from the current state and our current or prospective customers could materially postpone, reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. If assumed net sales and cash flow projections are not achieved in future periods, our Commercial Solutions or Government Solutions reporting units could be at risk of failing Step One of the goodwill impairment test and goodwill and intangibles assigned to the respective reporting units could be impaired.\nFor purposes of reviewing impairment and the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, both the Government Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments constitute a reporting unit and we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of each respective reporting unit. Reporting units are defined by how our President and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") manages the business, which includes resource allocation decisions. We may, in the future, change our management approach which in turn may change the way we define our reporting units, as such term is defined by FASB ASC 350. A change to our management approach may require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and ultimately record impairment charges in a future period.\nOn August 1, 2016 (the first day of our fiscal 2017), we performed our annual quantitative assessment (commonly referred to as a Step One test) and estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approach. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 11.8% and 40.5%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. If we had not utilized the market approach, our Commercial Solutions reporting unit's goodwill would be at risk of impairment. During interim periods, if our expected financial results materially decline below our initial expectations or if other events and circumstances change which indicate the potential for impairment (e.g., a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock (considered on both absolute terms and relative to peers)), we may be required to record interim impairment charges when we perform and fail an interim test or in other future periods. In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2017 (the start of our fiscal 2018).\nIn addition to our impairment analysis of goodwill, we also review net intangibles with finite lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. No events were identified during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. As such, we believe that the carrying values of our net intangibles were recoverable as of July 31, 2016. Any impairment charges that we may record in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nWe could be negatively impacted by a systems failure or security breach through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, by other significant disruption of our IT networks or those we operate for certain customers, or third party data center facilities, servers and related systems.\nWe face the risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems, including third party data center facilities, whether through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT network and systems, as well as third party data center facilities, have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer\u2019s IT networks and related systems which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. We may incur significant costs to prevent such systems disruptions.\nAs a communications company, and particularly as a government contractor and a provider of 911 systems, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our IT networks, third party data center facilities and related systems and to certain of our equipment used on some of our customer\u2019s IT networks and related systems. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions will not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, data centers, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.\nA security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could:\n\u2022\nDisrupt the proper functioning of these networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers;\n\u2022\nResult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u2022\nCompromise national security and other sensitive government functions;\n\u2022\nRequire significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; and\n\u2022\nDamage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.\nIn addition, the cost of continually defending against cyber-attacks and breaches has increased in recent years and future costs and any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe measures we have implemented to secure information we collect and store or enable access to may be breached, which could cause us to breach agreements with our partners and expose us to potential investigation and penalties by authorities and potential claims for contract breach, product liability damages, credits, penalties or termination by persons whose information was disclosed.\nWe take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect and store and to prevent unauthorized access to third party data to which we enable access through our products, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access despite our efforts. If such unauthorized disclosure or access does occur, we may be required to notify persons whose information was disclosed or accessed under existing and proposed laws. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We also may be subject to claims of breach of contract for such disclosure, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities and potential claims by persons whose information was disclosed. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential customers and end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our products and services. We may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damages caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our services. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end user\u2019s mobile device to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOur U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns are subject to audit and a resulting tax assessment or settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.\nThe final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) has recently audited our federal income tax return for fiscal 2014 and our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2013 and 2015 remain subject to potential future IRS audits. In addition, TCS's federal income tax returns for calendar year 2013 through 2015 are subject to potential future IRS audit. In addition to income tax audits, TCS is subject to ongoing state and local tax audits by the Washington State Department of Revenue and the City of Seattle. Although adjustments relating to past audits of our federal tax returns (including the audit of fiscal 2014) were immaterial, a resulting tax assessment or settlement for other periods or other jurisdictions that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe have significant operations in Arizona, Florida, California, Washington State, New York and other locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a terrorist attack and government responses thereto or significant disruptions (including natural disasters) to our business.\nTerrorist attacks, the U.S. and other governments' responses thereto, and threats of war could materially adversely impact our business, results of operation and financial condition. For example, our 911, hosted location-based services and satellite teleport services operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and equipment and systems in effective working order, and to protect our systems against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, sabotage, unauthorized access to our system or similar events. Although all of our mission-critical systems and equipment are designed with built-in redundancy and security, any unanticipated interruption or delay in our operations or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a terrorist attack, threat, system failure or a breach of security. Insurance may not be available to us at all or, if available, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona. We expect intercompany manufacturing to increase from current levels in future periods and we intend to maximize the use of our high-volume technology manufacturing center by continuing to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us. A terrorist attack or similar future event may disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers. If a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred with respect to our high-volume technology manufacturing center, we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities and, as a result, our business, results of operation and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nWe design and manufacture our over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred in the past, and traveling wave tube amplifiers in Santa Clara, California, an area close to major earthquake fault lines, and also manufacture amplifiers in Melville, New York, an area subject to hurricanes. Additionally, certain of our Commercial Solutions segment activities are conducted in Washington State which is also near a fault line. Our operations in these and other locations (such as in our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona), could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and man-made disasters or disruptions.\nWe cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience hardware or software failure, intentional disruptions of service by third parties, an act of God or an act of war. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data, and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business.\nIn the event of any such disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities.\nWe engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (\"RoHS\") directive which restricts the use of lead, mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products. The failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, the handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted, or could in the future result, in contamination requiring investigation or remediation, or lead to other liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe success of our business is dependent on compliance with FCC rules and regulations and similar foreign laws and regulations.\nMany of our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various U.S. government regulations, including those of the FCC, as well as similar international laws and regulations. As a result, our business faces increased risks including the following:\n\u2022\nWe must obtain various licenses from the FCC - We operate FCC licensed teleports that are subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the FCC Act, and the rules and regulations of the FCC. We cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant renewals when our existing licenses expire, nor are we assured that the FCC will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses. We may, in the future, be required to seek FCC or other government approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds certain specified criteria. Failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the FCC, or denial of certain contracts from other U.S. government agencies.\n\u2022\nWe are dependent on the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum - Adverse regulatory changes related to the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment, could materially harm our business by: (i) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (ii) making our current products less attractive or obsolete, or (iii) increasing the opportunity for additional competition. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services. The reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused, and may continue to cause, our customers to cancel, postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite, over-the-horizon microwave, or terrestrial line-of-sight microwave communication systems. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers. Changes in, or our failure to comply with, applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely harm our business, results of operation, and financial condition.\n\u2022\nOur future growth is dependent, in part, on developing NG911 compliant products - The FCC requires that certain location information be provided to network operators for public safety answering points when a subscriber makes a 911 call. Technical failures, greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities, time delays or the significant costs associated with developing or installing improved location technology could slow down or stop the deployment of our mobile location products. If deployment of improved location technology is delayed, stopped or never occurs, market acceptance of our products and services may be materially adversely affected. Because we rely on some third-party location technology instead of developing all of the technology ourselves, we have little or no influence over its improvement. The technology employed with NG911 services generally anticipates a migration to internet-protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) based communication. Since many companies are proficient in IP-based communication protocols, the barriers to entry to providing NG911 products and services are lower than exist for the traditional switch-based protocols. If we are unable to develop unique and proprietary solutions that are superior to and more cost effective than other market offers, our 911 business could get replaced by new market entrants, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\n\u2022\nUnder the FCC\u2019s mandate, our 911 business is dependent on state and local governments - Under the FCC\u2019s mandate, wireless carriers are required to provide 911 services only if state and local governments request the service. As part of a state or local government\u2019s decision to request 911, they have the authority to develop cost recovery mechanisms. However, cost recovery is no longer a condition to wireless carriers\u2019 obligation to deploy the service. If state and local governments do not widely request that 911 services be provided or we become subject to significant pressures from wireless carriers with respect to pricing of 911 services, our 911 business would be harmed and future growth of our business would be reduced.\nRegulation of the mobile industry and VoIP is evolving, and unfavorable changes or our failure to comply with existing and potential new legislation or regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nAs the mobile industry continues to evolve, we believe greater regulation by federal, state or foreign governments or regulatory authorities is likely and face certain risks including:\n\u2022\nWe must adhere to existing and potentially new privacy rules related to mobile-location based services - We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information, could affect our customers\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing our ability to utilize this information for the purpose of continued improvement of the overall mobile subscriber experience. In order for mobile location products and services to function properly, wireless carriers must locate their subscribers and store information on each subscriber\u2019s location. Although data regarding the location of the wireless user resides only on the wireless carrier\u2019s systems, users may not feel comfortable with the idea that the wireless carrier knows and can track their location. Carriers will need to obtain subscribers\u2019 permission to gather and use the subscribers\u2019 personal information, or they may not be able to provide customized mobile location services which those subscribers might otherwise desire. If subscribers view mobile location services as an annoyance or a threat to their privacy, that could reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe may face increased compliance costs in connection with health and safety requirements for mobile devices - If wireless handsets pose health and safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations and demand for our products and services may decrease. Media reports have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would decrease demand for our services. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment, including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and other medical devices. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to market and sell our products and services.\n\u2022\nThe regulatory environment for VoIP services is developing - The FCC has determined that VoIP services are not subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional wireline and wireless telephone services. If the regulatory environment for VoIP services evolves in a manner other than the way we anticipate, our 911 business would be significantly harmed and future growth of our business would be significantly reduced. For example, the regulatory scheme for wireless and wireline service providers requires those carriers to allow service providers such as us to have access to certain databases that make the delivery of a 911 call possible. No such requirements exist for VoIP service providers so carriers could prevent us from continuing to provide VoIP 911 service by denying us access to the required databases.\nAll of our business activities are subject to rapid technological change, new entrants, the introduction of other distribution models and long development and testing periods each of which may harm our competitive position, render our product or service offerings obsolete and require us to continuously develop technology and/or obtain licensed technology in order to compete successfully.\nWe are engaged in business activities characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product announcements and enhancements, and changing customer demands. The introduction of products and services on future industry standards embodying new technologies such as multi-frequency time-division multiple access (\"MF-TDMA\") based technologies could render any of our products and services obsolete or non-competitive. The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon wireless network operators launching and maintaining mobile location services, our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team, our ability to create new network software products and adapt our existing products to rapidly changing technologies, industry standards and customer needs. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product offerings, new technologies may require long development and testing periods. Additionally, new products may not achieve market acceptance or our competitors could develop alternative technologies that gain broader market acceptance than our products. If we are unable to develop and introduce technologically advanced products that respond to evolving industry standards and customer needs, or if we are unable to complete the development and introduction of these products on a timely and cost effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition or could result in our technology becoming obsolete.\nNew entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. For example, many companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition and some of our products may become commoditized. Our DoubleTalk\u00ae Carrier-in-Carrier\u00ae bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party that maintains patents associated with the technology. Other competitors have developed similar technologies and some may have also licensed parts or all of this compression technology.\nOur Commercial Solutions segment provides various technologies that are utilized on mobile phones. Applications from competitors for location-based or text-based messaging platforms may be preloaded on mobile devices by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or offered by OEMs directly. Increased competition from providers of location-based services which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carrier\u2019s branded location-based services, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these location-based or text-based services may be offered for free or on a onetime fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a onetime fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in our average revenue per user if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services.\nOur expected growth and our financial position depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies. We may not have the financial or technological resources to keep pace with such changes and developments or be successful in our research and development and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost-effective fashion. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our business.\nOur business is highly competitive and some of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, which could result in a loss of customers, market share and/or market acceptance.\nOur business is highly competitive. We will continue to invest in research and development for the introduction of new and enhanced products and services designed to improve capacity, data processing rates and features. We must also continue to develop new features and to improve functionality of our software. Research and development in our industry is complex, expensive and uncertain. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. If we continue to expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, but our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of product and service enhancements that are competitive in the marketplace, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nSeveral of our potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, larger competitors have certain advantages over us which could cause us to lose customers and impede our ability to attract new customers, including: larger bases of financial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources; more established relationships with wireless carriers and government customers; more funds to deploy products and services; and the ability to lower prices (or not charge any price) of competitive products and services because they are selling larger volumes. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nContract cost growth on our fixed price contracts, including most of our government contracts, cost reimbursable type contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks.\nA substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts inherently have more risk than flexibly priced contracts. This means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological, manufacturing, supply or other problems, price increases or other increases in the cost of performance. Future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates which could negatively impact our profitability. Operating margin is materially adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred. This cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect, or if estimates to complete increase. To a lesser extent, we provide products and services under cost reimbursable type contracts which carry the entire burden of costs exceeding a negotiated contract ceiling price.\nThe cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOngoing compliance with the provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards could unexpectedly materially increase our costs and compliance related expenses.\nBecause we are a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with provisions of securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards. Because securities laws, related regulations and financial reporting standards pertaining to our business are relatively complex, our business faces increased risks including the following:\n\u2022\nIf we identify a material weakness in the future, our costs may unexpectedly increase - Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, we are required to furnish a report of management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to and provide a separate opinion. To issue our report, we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion, and then we test and evaluate the results. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses, if any, that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. There likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. In fiscal 2016, we transitioned from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") 1992 Internal Control - Integrated Framework to the COSO 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework. In accordance with the rules and regulations related to Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are taking a one-year exemption related to the controls of TCS. We have begun the process of implementing new controls related to TCS, and in the future, we may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and incur additional costs.\n\u2022\nStock-based compensation accounting standards could negatively impact our stock - Since our inception, we have used stock-based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock-based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. We apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation,\" which requires us to record compensation expense in our statement of operations for employee and director stock-based awards using a fair value method. The ongoing application of this standard has had a significant effect on our reported earnings, and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock-based awards (including long-term performance shares which are subject to the achievement of three-year goals which are based on several performance metrics). The ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility. To the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock-based awards to employees, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe must adopt new complex revenue recognition rules - The accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex. Accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. The FASB has recently issued new guidance for revenue recognition. The new guidance replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety. Given the impact of our recent acquisition of TCS on February 23, 2016, we have not yet selected a transition method and continue to evaluate the impact that this guidance will have on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Regardless of the transition method, the application of this new guidance may result in certain adjustments to our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income. Because of the uncertainty of the estimates, judgments and assumptions associated with our accounting policies, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022\nChanges in securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards are increasing our costs - The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 required changes in some of our corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices. These changes have resulted in increased costs. The SEC has promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement to use the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (commonly referred to as \"XBRL\") in our financial statements, which we began including in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). In April 2016, as part of its Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative, the SEC published a concept release which considers various business and financial disclosures that public companies make in investor reports and seeks the public\u2019s input on ways to further improve that disclosure. The issues raised by the SEC in the concept release have the potential to dramatically change the way in which companies prepare and deliver disclosure to investors and the burdens of preparing that disclosure. In August 2012, the SEC adopted new rules establishing additional disclosure, supply chain verification and reporting requirements regarding a public company's use of Conflict Minerals procured from Covered Countries (as both of those terms are defined by the SEC). These SEC rules and reporting requirements have resulted in us incurring additional costs to document and perform supplier due diligence. As these rules impact our suppliers, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and/or raw material prices could increase. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage and could harm our reputation.\nOur costs to comply with the aforementioned and other regulations continue to increase and we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs to comply with ongoing or future requirements. In addition, the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\"NASDAQ\") routinely changes its requirements for companies, such as us, that are listed on NASDAQ. These changes (and potential future changes) have increased and may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage. We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee, and qualified executive officers.\nOur backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in a decline in sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory.\nWe currently have a backlog of orders, mostly under contracts that our customers may modify or terminate. Almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. A portion of our backlog is determined based on contracts received from our customers (such as the U.S. government and large telephone companies) and in certain cases, is computed by multiplying the most recent month\u2019s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements. There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. There is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual receipt of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, the program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised not being exercised.\nWe record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors, including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If orders in our backlog are canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face a number of risks relating to the expected growth of our business. Our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage this growth.\nThese risks include:\n\u2022\nThe loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business - Our future success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel. Many of our key technical management personnel would be difficult to replace, and are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements. We currently have research and development employees in areas that are located a great distance away from our U.S. headquarters. Managing remote product development operations is difficult and we may not be able to manage the employees in these remote centers successfully. Our expected growth and future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations is intense. Although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and retaining key personnel, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to grow and operate profitably. Also, the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we grow and diversify.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to improve our processes and systems to keep pace with anticipated growth - The future growth of our business may place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In order to manage that growth, we must be prepared to improve and expand our management, operational and financial systems and controls. We also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and technology transitions. If we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\n\u2022\nOur markets are highly competitive and there can be no assurance that we can continue our success - The markets for our products are highly competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own. We expect the Department of Defense\u2019s increased use of commercial off-the-shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market. Also, although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries, we believe competition will continue to intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources greater than ours.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient components to meet expected demand - Our dependence on component availability, government furnished equipment, subcontractors and key suppliers, including the core manufacturing expertise of our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona, exposes us to risk. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors. A significant interruption in the delivery of such items, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, if our high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain affordable credit insurance may become more difficult - In the normal course of our business, we purchase credit insurance to mitigate some of our domestic and international credit risk. Although credit insurance remains generally available, upon renewal, it may become more expensive to obtain or may not be available for existing or new customers in certain international markets and it might require higher deductibles than in the past. If we acquire a company with a different customer base, we may not be able to obtain credit insurance for those sales. As such, there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain credit insurance on a basis consistent with our past practices.\nWe rely upon various third party companies and their technology to provide services to our customers and if we are unable to obtain such services at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks from our reliance with these third parties include:\n\u2022\nThe loss of mapping and third party content - The wireless data services provided to our customers are dependent on real-time, continuous feeds from map data, points of interest data, traffic information, gas prices, theater, event and weather information from vendors and others. Any disruption of this third party content from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds or other disruption could result in delays in our subscribers\u2019 ability to receive information. We obtain this data that we sell to our customers from companies owned by current and potential competitors, who may act in a manner that is not in our best interest. If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location-based services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide the services of our wireless applications business would be materially adversely affected. Our gross margins may also be materially adversely affected if the cost of third party data and content increases substantially.\n\u2022\nThird party data centers or third party networks may fail - Many products and services of our advanced communication solutions, in particular our public safety and enterprise technology solutions, are provided through a combination of our servers, which we house at third party data centers, and the networks of our wireless carrier partners. As such, our business relies to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third party data centers we use. Our hosted data centers are currently located in third party facilities located in the Irvine and San Francisco, California areas, and we may use others as required. We also use third party data center facilities in the Phoenix, Arizona area to provide for disaster recovery. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third party data center facilities or in our servers maintained at their location could affect the performance of the products and services of our wireless applications and 911 business and harm our reputation and our revenue. The ability of our subscribers to receive critical location and business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers. Any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could also result in delays in our subscribers\u2019 ability to receive information.\n\u2022\nWe must integrate our technologies and routinely upgrade them - We may not be able to upgrade our location-based services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions, or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual obligations. In addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our location-based services platform, may materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe rely upon \u201copen-source\u201d software - We have incorporated some types of open source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs. Thus far, we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open source software. However, as the use of open source software becomes more widespread, certain open source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nTCS is a party to lawsuits and other disputes related to intellectual property and contract obligations. The resolutions of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions in certain of our customer contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses related to third-party intellectual property claims. Some customers seek indemnification under their contractual arrangements with the Company for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, and the use of our products and services in combination with products and services of other vendors. In some cases we have agreed to assume the defense of the case. In others, the Company will negotiate with these customers in good faith because the Company believes its technology does not infringe the cited patents and due to specific clauses within the customer contractual arrangements that may or may not give rise to an indemnification obligation. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount the Company may spend under these agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.\nTCS is currently a party to a number of legal proceedings, including lawsuits relating to customers seeking indemnification under contractual arrangements for claims and other costs associated with defending lawsuits alleging infringement of patents through their use of our products and services, including in combination with products and services of other vendors. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 31, 2016 includes a $28.1 million liability, which represents the preliminary estimated fair value for pre-acquisition contingencies related to certain intellectual property legal proceedings and contractual obligations that existed as of the date of acquisition. These preliminary estimated fair values reflect market participant assumptions, as required by FASB ASC 805 \"Business Combinations,\" and do not reflect our settlement position or amounts we actually may pay if an unfavorable resolution occurs. For additional information, see \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (14)(b) Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings and Other Matters\" included in \"Part II-Item 8.- Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company's assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period.\nWe are, from time to time, and could become a party to additional litigation or subject to claims, including patent infringement and product liability claims, relating to our software, government investigations and other proceedings that could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in commercial disputes and civil litigation relating to our businesses. Our agreements with customers may require us to indemnify such customers. Direct claims against us or claims against our customers may relate to infringement of third party intellectual property rights, defects in or non-conformance of our products, or our own acts of negligence and non-performance. Occasionally, we are called upon also to provide information in connection with litigation involving other parties or government investigations. Product liability and other forms of insurance are expensive and may not be available in the future. We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at acceptable costs or in sufficient amounts or that our insurer will not disclaim coverage as to a future claim. Any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nBecause our software may contain defects or errors, and our hardware products may incorporate defective components, our sales could decrease if these defects or errors adversely affect our reputation or delay shipments of our products.\nProducts as complex as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products may not be error or defect free after delivery to customers, which could damage our reputation, cause revenue losses, result in the rejection of our products or services, divert development resources and increase service and warranty costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nSoftware products such as our 911 call handling software solutions, must meet the stringent technical requirements of our customers and satisfy our warranty obligations to our customers. In August 2016, AT&T, a distributor of a small TCS product line that we refer to as our 911 call handling software solution, informed us that they do not believe we met certain contractual specifications related to performance and usability and has requested a refund of certain payments made by them. In addition, AT&T has requested that we make certain changes to our 911 call handling software and provide those enhancements to them at no additional cost.\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 31, 2016 includes a $7.2 million liability, reflecting the preliminary estimated fair value of this contingent liability, as required by FASB ASC 805 \"Business Combinations.\" The estimated fair value was based on a review of contractual obligations and estimates of costs to enhance the software. We do not anticipate deploying additional 911 call handling software solutions sold through AT&T until this issue is resolved. In fiscal 2016, we sold an aggregate of approximately $4.5 million of 911 call handling software solutions, a majority of which was derived from our relationship with AT&T. Sales in our fiscal 2017 for this product line are expected to be similar to what we achieved in fiscal 2016. Although we expect to resolve this issue amicably with AT&T, we may not be able to so.\nOur hardware products are also subject to warranty obligations and integrate a wide variety of components from different vendors. We must quickly develop new products and product enhancements to keep pace with the rapidly changing software and telecommunications markets in which we operate.\nProtection of our intellectual property is limited and pursuing infringers of our patents and other intellectual property rights can be costly.\nOur businesses rely, in large part, upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know-how and production techniques. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and unfair competition laws, restrictions in licensing agreements, confidentiality provisions and various other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and related proprietary rights, but these legal means provide only limited protection. Although a number of patents have been issued to us and we have obtained a number of other patents as a result of our acquisitions, we cannot assure you that our issued patents will be upheld if challenged by another party. Additionally, with respect to any patent applications which we have filed, we cannot assure you that any patents will issue as a result of these applications.\nThe departure of any of our key management and technical personnel, the breach of their confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others. We may fail to do so. In addition, the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property rights is also subject to the terms of future government contracts. We cannot assure you that the federal government will not demand greater intellectual property rights or restrict our ability to disseminate intellectual property. We are also a member of standards-setting organizations and have agreed to license some of our intellectual property to other members on fair and reasonable terms to the extent that the license is required to develop non-infringing products.\nPursuing infringers of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to pursue infringers could result in our competitors utilizing our technology and offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Protecting our know-how is difficult especially after our employees or those of our third party contract service providers end their employment or engagement. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse-engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology or prevent others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The costs and diversion of resources could significantly harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it.\nThird parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights and we could be prevented from selling our products, or suffer significant litigation expense, even if these claims have no merit.\nOur competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Third parties, however, may claim that we, our products, operations or any products or technology we obtain from other parties are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our assets, technology and products. From time to time we receive letters from third parties who allege we are infringing their intellectual property and ask us to license such intellectual property. We review the merits of each such letter and respond as we deem appropriate.\nFrom time to time our customers are parties to allegations of intellectual property infringement claims based on our customers\u2019 incorporation and use of our products and services, which may lead to demands from our customers for us to indemnify them for costs in defending those allegations. Any litigation regarding patents, trademarks, copyrights or intellectual property rights, even those without merit, and the related indemnification demands of our customers, can be costly and time consuming, and divert our management and key personnel from operating our business. The complexity of the technology involved and inherent uncertainty and cost of intellectual property litigation increases our risks. If any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties, which may be costly or impractical. This also may require us to stop selling our products as currently engineered, which could harm our competitive position. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our products or services and may result in a material loss of revenue.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our products and client applications, discontinue the sale of our products or services in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nIf our wireless carrier partners change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our products to their end-customers or do not continue to provide our services at all, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, potential future business combinations among wireless network operators could result in a loss of revenue for our business.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that are wireless carriers such as AT&T and Verizon. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end users who subscribe to our service on a standalone basis or in a bundle with other services. To date, a relatively small number of end users have subscribed for our services in connection with their wireless plans compared to the total number of mobile phone users. Our future growth depends heavily on achieving significantly increased subscriber adoption of the wireless communication solutions we sell either through standalone subscriptions to our solutions or as part of bundles from our existing wireless carrier partners. Our success also depends on achieving widespread deployment of our solutions by attracting and retaining additional wireless carrier partners. Future revenue will depend on the pricing and quality of those services and subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, and the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nPoor performance in or disruptions of the services including in our advanced communication solutions could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities (including breach of contract claims brought by our customers and third-party damages claims brought by end-users). Our wireless carrier agreements and certain customers require us to meet specific requirements including operational uptime requirements or be subject to penalties.\nIf we are unable to meet contractual requirements with our wireless carrier partners, such as AT&T, they could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us.\nCompetitors offer technology that has functionality similar to ours for free, under different business models. Competition from these free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners can offer these location-based services to their subscribers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe telecommunications industry generally is currently undergoing a consolidation phase. Many of our customers, specifically wireless carrier customers of our Commercial Solutions segment, have or may become the target of acquisitions. If the number of our customers is significantly reduced as a result of this consolidation trend, or if the resulting companies do not utilize our product offerings, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe stock market in general and the stock prices of technology-based companies, in particular, experience extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well. Factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include, among others:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate TCS and manage our combined company;\n\u2022\nstrategic transactions, such as acquisitions and divestures;\n\u2022\nissuance of potentially dilutive equity or equity-type securities;\n\u2022\nissuance of debt;\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nreceipt or non-receipt of substantial orders for products and services;\n\u2022\nquality deficiencies in services or products;\n\u2022\nresults of technological innovations;\n\u2022\nnew commercial products;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the status or outcome of government audits;\n\u2022\nproprietary rights or product or patent litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. government policies;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions generally, particularly in the telecommunications sector;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities market conditions, generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in the status of litigation and legal matters (including changes in the status of export matters);\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks;\n\u2022\nenergy blackouts;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism or war;\n\u2022\ninflation or deflation; and\n\u2022\nrumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices.\nShortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of our shares of common stock could dilute your ownership interest in Comtech and reduce the market price of our shares of common stock.\nIn the future we may issue additional securities to raise capital. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in Comtech and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Comtech.\nWe have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving Comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nFor example, we have a classified board and the employment contract with our President and CEO, and agreements with other of our executive officers, provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of Comtech. In the future, we may adopt a stockholder rights plan which could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder, and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, this statute provides that, except in certain limited circumstances, a corporation shall not engage in any \"business combination\" with an \"interested stockholder\" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nA \"business combination\" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an \"interested stockholder\" is a person who, together with affiliates, owns, or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Comtech.\nA disruption in our dividend program could negatively impact our stock price.\nSince September 2010, we have paid quarterly dividends pursuant to an annual targeted dividend amount established by our Board of Directors. The current annual targeted dividend for fiscal 2017 is $1.20 per common share.\nOur dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and maintain compliance with our Secured Credit Facility. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our Board of Directors began further assessing our capital needs generally and the appropriate level of future dividends. Future dividends also remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under the Company's Secured Credit Facility as well as Board approval. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time.\nAdditionally, our ability to declare and pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock may also be restricted by the terms of our Secured Credit Facility and may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we enter into in the future.", "PERMNO": 26201, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "CMTL"}
