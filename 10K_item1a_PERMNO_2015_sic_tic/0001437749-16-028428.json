There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual long-term impact that such laws, regulations and programs will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility, liquidity and confidence issues, and limited credit availability recently experienced. The failure of such laws, regulations and programs to continue to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current national and international financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our common stock.\nRecent levels of market volatility are unprecedented.\nOver the past several years, the volatility and disruption of financial and credit markets reached unprecedented levels for recent times. In some cases, the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. If recent and current levels of market disruption and volatility continue, recur, or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and government sponsored enterprises. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or other obligation due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nOur primary source of funding for our operations is deposits from customers in our local market. Should other banks in or near our market areas fail, it could cause our deposit customers to lose confidence in banks and cause them to withdraw or substantially restrict their deposits with us. If such activity reached a high enough level, it could substantially disrupt our business. There is no assurance that such disruptions, were they to occur, would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nMarket developments in recent years may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nDramatic declines in the housing market during recent years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps, other derivative securities, as well as loans, have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. The resulting lack of available credit, lack of confidence in the financial sector, increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely, directly or indirectly, affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation which could change and increase our cost of doing business or have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies. Most of this regulation is designed to protect our depositors and other customers, not our shareholders. Our compliance with the requirements of these agencies is costly and may limit our growth and restrict certain of our activities, including, payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, locations of offices, and compensation of our officers. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by federal authorities and our failure to meet those guidelines could result in limitations being imposed on our activities or, in an extreme case, in our bank\u2019s being placed in receivership.\nVarious laws, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (\u201cEESA\u201d), and the Dodd-Frank Act, and related regulations are structured to spread the governmental costs of problems in the financial industry broadly over the financial industry in order to prevent the taxpayers from having to pay such costs. As a result, assessments by the FDIC to pay for deposit insurance have increased, and will likely continue to increase, perhaps substantially, and the total our bank will be required to pay could increase enough to materially affect our income and our ability to operate profitably. Additionally, EESA contains a provision for the financial industry to be required to absorb, in an as yet undetermined fashion, any losses suffered by the government on account of its acquiring troubled assets under the Troubled Assets Relief Program of EESA. The Dodd-Frank Act made numerous changes in the way financial institutions are regulated, and creates a new agency to regulate consumer protection as well as expanding and modifying consumer protection laws.\nWe are also subject to the extensive and expensive requirements imposed on public companies by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and some regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act are yet to be adopted, thus we cannot predict the impact of these changes on our business or profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nWe are susceptible to changes in monetary policy and other economic factors which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nChanges in governmental, economic and monetary policies may affect the ability of our bank to attract deposits and make loans. The rates of interest payable on deposits and chargeable on loans are affected by governmental regulation and fiscal policy as well as by national, state and local economic conditions. National and international economic conditions and governmental efforts to control such conditions affect us directly and indirectly. All of these matters are outside of our control and affect our ability to operate profitably.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on the services of a number of key personnel, and a loss of any of those personnel could disrupt our operations and result in reduced revenues.\nThe success of our business depends to a great extent on our customer relationships. Our growth and development to date have depended in large part on the efforts of our senior management team. These senior officers have primary contact with our customers and are extremely important in maintaining personalized relationships with our customer base, a key aspect of our business strategy, and in increasing our market presence. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and possibly result in reduced revenues if we were unable to find suitable replacements promptly.\nWe may be unable to successfully manage our sustained growth.\nWe grew rapidly in our first 12 years of operations. Although we have not grown significantly since 2009, and do not expect to continue to grow as fast in the future as we have in the past, it is our intention to continue to expand our asset base. Our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to manage growth successfully. Our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions and interest rate trends. If we grow too quickly and are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, growth could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur future growth or regulatory requirements may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or be unavailable on favorable terms.\nAlthough we are currently well capitalized, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to support additional growth or to meet increasing regulatory requirements. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend, among other things, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. If we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be limited and, if we cannot continue to meet regulatory capital requirements, our existence could also be limited.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate markets could hurt our business.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, which provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. However, the property may deteriorate in value before the loan is repaid, as was the case in recent years. The real estate market was substantially impacted by the recent recessionary economic environment, increased levels of inventories of unsold homes, and higher foreclosure rates. As a result, property values declined substantially. In some cases, this downturn resulted in impairment to the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Real estate values in our markets have recently begun to improve, but any future deterioration in the real estate market may result in a negative impact on the level of credit quality in our loan portfolio, and may lead to an additional increase in our provisions for loan losses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to higher credit risk by commercial real estate, commercial business, and construction lending.\nCommercial real estate, commercial business and construction lending usually involves higher credit risks than single-family residential lending. These types of loans may involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. Commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties, as well as the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period, but have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment typically depends on being able to either refinance the loan or sell the underlying property in a timely manner.\nRisk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of construction (including interest) and the availability of permanent financing. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate, or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by foreclosure.\nCommercial business loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow and general liquidity of the borrower, and secondarily on the value of the underlying collateral and/or repayment capacity of any guarantor. The borrower\u2019s cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use. In addition, business assets may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Accordingly, the repayment of commercial business loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral value provided by the borrower and liquidity of the guarantor.\nCommercial real estate, commercial business, and construction loans are also more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. Our underwriting, review, and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans. Furthermore, the banking regulators are more closely scrutinizing commercial real estate lending, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement enhanced underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels.\nOur assets include significant amounts of real estate acquired through foreclosure or in settlement of loans, which we may not be able to sell without incurring additional losses.\nWe have acquired, and may continue to acquire, significant amounts of real estate through foreclosure or settlement of loans in default. When we acquire such real estate, it is written down to its estimated fair market value less the estimated costs of selling. If we cannot sell the property for that amount we will incur additional loss which, for one or more properties, could materially reduce our earnings.\nIf our loan customers do not pay us as they have contracted to, we may experience losses, and the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover such losses.\nOur principal revenue producing business is making loans. If the loans are not repaid, we will suffer losses. Even though we maintain an allowance for loan losses, the amount of the allowance may not be adequate to cover the losses we experience. We attempt to mitigate this risk by a thorough review of the creditworthiness of loan customers. Nevertheless, there is risk that our credit evaluations will prove to be inaccurate due to changed circumstances or otherwise, which could result in a significant adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner, or rely on financial statements that do not comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) or are materially misleading.\nOur business is concentrated in Greater Charleston, and a prolonged downturn in the economy of the Charleston area, decline in Charleston area real estate values or other events in our market area may adversely affect our business.\nSubstantially all of our business is located in the Greater Charleston area. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are affected by changes in the Charleston economy. Over the past several years, we have experienced the adverse effects of the economic recession in the form of increased nonpayment and delinquent payment of loans, and decreases in the value of collateral securing loans and of real estate acquired through foreclosures. As was the case over the past several years, economic recession and general decline in Charleston area real estate values or other adverse economic conditions would be expected to result in decreases in demand for our services, increases in nonpayment of loans and decreases in the value of collateral securing loans. The existence of adverse economic conditions, declines in real estate values or the occurrence of other adverse economic conditions in Charleston and South Carolina could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in an area susceptible to hurricane and other weather related damage which could disrupt our business and reduce our profitability.\nNearly all of our business and our customers are located in coastal South Carolina, an area that often experiences damage from hurricanes and other weather phenomena. We attempt to mitigate such risk with insurance and by requiring insurance on property we take as collateral. However, catastrophic weather damage to a large portion of our market area could cause substantial disruptions to our business and our customers\u2019 businesses which would reduce our profitability for some period.\nWe face strong competition from larger, more established competitors which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nWe encounter strong competition from financial institutions operating in the greater Charleston, South Carolina area. In the conduct of our business, we also compete with credit unions, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial institutions, some of which are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending abilities than we have and offer services, such as investment banking, trust and international banking services that we do not provide. We believe that we have competed, and will continue to be able to compete, effectively with these institutions because of our experienced bankers and personalized service, as well as through loan participations and other strategies and techniques. However, we cannot promise that we are correct in our belief. If we are wrong, our ability to operate profitably may be negatively affected.\nTechnological changes affect our business, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to enabling financial institutions to serve customers better, the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success may depend, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may need to make significant additional capital investments in technology in the future, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As client, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks.\nAlthough we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks, and our clients\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, and other third parties, including the South Carolina Department of Revenue, which had records exposed in a 2012 cyber attack, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\nWhile we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected because we are exposed to conditions or assumptions different from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies included in this report describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. If future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures could be materially affected.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations and financial condition.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely impact our financial condition.\nOur deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain deposit insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Although we cannot predict what the insurance assessment rates will be in the future, either deterioration in our risk-based capital ratios or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material diverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur profitability and liquidity are affected by changes in interest rates and economic conditions.\nOur profitability depends upon our net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on our interest-bearing assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income is adversely affected when market interest rates change such that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments or, conversely, when the interest we earn on loans and investments decreases faster than the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings. Interest rates, and consequently our results of operations, are affected by general economic conditions (domestic and foreign) and fiscal and monetary policies. Monetary and fiscal policies may materially affect the level and direction of interest rates. Increases in interest rates generally decrease the market values of interest-bearing investments and loans held and therefore may adversely affect our liquidity and earnings. Increased interest rates also generally affect the volume of mortgage loan originations, the resale value of mortgage loans originated for resale, and the ability of borrowers to perform under existing loans of all types. Decreases in interest rates generally have the opposite effect on market values of interest-bearing assets, the volume of mortgage loan originations, the resale value of mortgage loans originated for resale, and the ability of borrowers to perform under existing loans of all types from the effect of increases in interest rates.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock has a limited trading market, which may limit your ability to sell your stock.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cSOCB.\u201d Since January 1, 2015, the average daily trading volume has been less than 10,000 shares. Accordingly, a shareholder who wishes to sell a large number of shares may experience a delay in selling the shares or have to sell them at a lower price in order to sell them promptly.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline.\nThe market prices of many financial institution equity securities, including ours, declined significantly from 2008 to 2012 in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and the lingering effects of the related recession. There can be no assurance that significant declines in the market price of our common stock will not be experienced in the future.\nWe may issue additional securities, which could affect the market price of our common stock and dilute your ownership.\nWe may issue additional securities to raise additional capital, to support growth, or to make acquisitions. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception by the market that those sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of common stock or to use our common stock in future acquisitions. The issuance of substantial amounts of additional securities could reduce your proportionate ownership of the Company.\nWe do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We plan to use the funds that might otherwise be available to pay dividends to increase our capital.\nDeclaration and payment of dividends are within the discretion of our board of directors. Our bank will be our most likely source of funds with which to pay cash dividends. Our bank\u2019s declaration and payment of future dividends to us are within the discretion of the bank\u2019s board of directors, and are dependent upon its earnings, financial condition, its need to retain earnings for use in the business and any other pertinent factors. Payment of dividends is also subject to various regulatory requirements and considerations. Furthermore, as long as there are preferred securities of the Southcoast Capital Trust III outstanding and the Company has elected to defer making interest payments with respect to the preferred securities as permitted by the terms of the preferred securities, the Company may not declare or pay dividends on its common stock or redeem or repurchase any shares of its common stock, subject to certain minor exceptions, including payment of stock dividends.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and South Carolina law may discourage or prevent takeover attempts, and these provisions may have the effect of reducing the market price for our stock.\nOur articles of incorporation include several provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing hostile takeover attempts, and therefore of making the removal of incumbent management difficult. The provisions include staggered terms for our board of directors and requirements of supermajority votes to approve certain business transactions. In addition, South Carolina law contains several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors, and may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. To the extent that these provisions are effective in discouraging or preventing takeover attempts, they may tend to reduce the market price for our stock.\nOur common stock is not insured, so you could lose your total investment.\nOur common stock is not a deposit, savings account or obligation of our bank and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Should our business fail, you could lose your total investment.\nThere are additional risks related to our common stock in connection with our proposed merger with BNC Bancorp.\nA number of additional risks to our common stock in connection with the Company\u2019s proposed merger with BNC Bancorp are set forth under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus of the Company and BNC Bancorp, filed December 23, 2015, which risk factors are incorporated herein by reference.", "PERMNO": 90331, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SOCB"}
