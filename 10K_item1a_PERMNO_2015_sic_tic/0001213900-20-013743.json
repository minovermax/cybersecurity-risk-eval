Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully review and consider the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Annual Report, including the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included herein, in making investment decisions in connection with our Common Stock. The following risk factors apply to the business and operations of Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. following the completion of the Business Combination. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in these risk factors, alone, or in combination with other events or circumstances, may have a material adverse effect on the business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, including matters addressed in the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d We may face additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business or financial condition. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included herein.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history and has not yet generated any revenue from product sales. Xynomic and its subsidiaries, our operating entities, has incurred operating losses since its inception and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a drug candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. Xynomic Pharma, our operating subsidiary, commenced operations in August 2016. Its operations to date have been limited primarily to organizing and staffing the company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing drug candidates, undertaking pre-clinical studies, and clinically developing drug candidates. We have never generated any revenue from drug sales, and has not obtained regulatory approvals for any of its drug candidates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we reported a net loss of $25.1 million. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we had a net loss of $28.6 million.\nWe expect to incur significantly higher expenses and operating losses over the next several years in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:\n\u25cf continue pre-clinical and clinical development of its programs;\n\u25cf in-license and subsequently develop additional oncology drug candidates;\n\u25cf continue to discover, validate and develop additional drug candidates;\n\u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf Hire additional research, development and business personnel;\n\u25cf incur costs associated with filing marketing authorization applications;\n\u25cf if abexinostat is successfully approved for commercialization, incur additional costs associated with establishing sales and marketing infrastructure for abexinostat in U.S., China and other territories; and\n\u25cf incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company upon the Closing.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize drug candidates with significant market potential. This will require it to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of its drug candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these drug candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those drug candidates for which it may obtain marketing approval, and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. It may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if it does, we may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nWe are a holding company and will conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and derive all of our operating income from subsidiaries of us. Other than any cash we may retain, all of our assets will be held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries. We will rely on the earnings and cash flows of us, which will be paid to us by our subsidiaries, if and only to the extent available, in the form of dividends and other payments or distributions, to meet our debt service obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their jurisdiction of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends and other distributions to us), the terms of existing and future indebtedness and other agreements of our subsidiaries and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.\nWe must obtain additional funds to finance our operations and to remain a going concern.\nXynomic incurred recurring losses from operations since inception and the net current liabilities (current assets less current liabilities) raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. We, together with our subsidiaries Xynomic Pharma, Xynomic Nanjing, Xynomic Shanghai and Xynomic Zhongshan (the \u201cGroup\u201d), have prepared its financial statements assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Group has incurred recurring losses from operations since inception. The Group incurred a net loss of $25.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Further, as of December 31, 2019, the Group had net current liabilities (current assets less current liabilities) of $23.1 million and accumulated deficit of $59.4 million. The Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to raise capital to fund its current research and development activities and future business plans. Additionally, volatility in the capital markets and general economic conditions in the United States may be a significant obstacle to raising the required funds. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months from the date these financial statements are issued. The financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Group be unable to continue as a going concern. If the going concern basis were not appropriate for these financial statements, adjustments would be necessary in the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses and the balance sheet classifications used.\nXynomic\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern will require it to obtain additional funding. The perception of Xynomic\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult to obtain financing for the continuation of Xynomic\u2019s operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors and employees. Additionally, volatility in the capital markets and general economic conditions in the United States may be a significant obstacle to raising the required funds.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed at favorable terms, it will be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate some of its drug development programs or commercialization efforts.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern will require it to obtain additional funding. Furthermore, our future capital requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including:\n\u25cf the scope, progress, results, and costs of drug discovery, pre-clinical studies, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for our drug candidates;\n\u25cf the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), National Medical Products Administration (\u201cNMPA\u201d), EMA and comparable regulatory authorities, including the potential that the FDA, NMPA, EMA or comparable regulatory authorities may require that we to perform additional studies;\n\u25cf the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of abexinostat and other drug candidates;\n\u25cf the success of its effort to commercially launch abexinostat;\n\u25cf our ability to in-license additional drug candidates on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under existing and new licensing agreements;\n\u25cf the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u25cf the costs of securing outsourced manufacturing arrangements for commercial production; and\n\u25cf the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities if we obtain regulatory clearances to market abexinostat or another drug candidate.\nAdditional fundraising efforts may distract management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize its drug candidates. There is no guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, additional financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of stockholders, and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased interest payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on its ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell, or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we will be required to significantly curtail, delay, or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any drug candidate or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations, or require us to relinquish rights to its technologies or drug candidates.\nIdentifying and acquiring rights to develop potential drug candidates and conducting pre-clinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that may take years to complete, and our commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of drug candidates that we do not expect to be commercially available until we receive regulatory approval, if at all. We may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales, and even if one or more of its drug candidates are approved, they may not achieve commercial success. Accordingly, we may need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements, strategic alliances, and marketing or distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights as a holder of our common stock. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. In addition, issuance of additional equity securities, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms, including relinquishing or licensing to a third party on unfavorable terms to our rights to technologies or drug candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or potentially reserve for future potential arrangements when we might be able to achieve more favorable terms.\nWe have a very limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess its future viability.\nWe commenced its operations in August 2016. Its operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing the company, identifying potential partnerships and drug candidates, acquiring product and technology rights, and conducting research and development activities for its drug candidates. We have not yet demonstrated the ability to successfully complete large-scale, pivotal clinical trials. We have also not yet obtained regulatory approval for, or demonstrated an ability to manufacture or commercialize, any of its drug candidates. Consequently, any predictions about our future success, performance, or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if it had a longer operating history or approved products on the market.\nOur limited operating history, particularly in light of the rapidly evolving drug research and development industry in which it operates, may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects for future performance. Its short history makes any assessment of its future performance or viability subject to significant uncertainty. We will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving fields as it seeks to transition to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. In addition, as a new business, it may be more likely to encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays due to limited experience. If we do not address these risks and difficulties successfully, its business will suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe recent COVID-19 outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has spread to the United States and many other parts of the world and is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business operations, employee availability, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow.\nThe ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19 was first reported on December 31, 2019 in City of Wuhan, Hubei, China and was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Efforts to prevent the virus spreading include travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures. These include a quarantine of Hubei, curfew measures elsewhere in China, and national travel restrictions. On late March, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that spread of domestically transmitted epidemic has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China. As a result, some of the government restrictions and quarantines abovementioned have relaxed in certain areas, including Shanghai.\nOn January 31, 2020, a public health emergency was declared in the United States with travel restrictions placed on entry for travelers from China. On March 13, 2020, a national emergency was further declared in the United States. On March 19, 2020, the governor of California issued a statewide stay-at-home order to help combat the spread of the COVID-19. As of late March 2020, more than 4 hundred thousand cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 190 countries and territories.\nThe Company\u2019s headquarters and operations are located in Shanghai and Beijing, China and City of San Diego, California, U.S. In each operation location, the Company has been following the measurements implemented by the local governments. The Company has suspended all business that required travel or gathering since January 23, 2020. Given that the outbreak has been gradually controlled in China, the Company, following the guidance released by Shanghai government, have resumed the business in the office and R&D center located in Shanghai on February 10, 2020. An aggregate of 17 employees have gone back to work. The Company is taking pro-active measures to help protect its employees by implementing body-temperature tests and face mask wearing requirement. Company\u2019s offices located in Beijing and City of San Diego, however, have been shut down since Chinese New Year and the outbreak in the State of California respectively as required by local governments. An aggregate of 11 employees are currently required to work from home and unable to perform certain duties that need to conducted onsite.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 which was first identified in the City of Wuhan, Hubei, China. The Company\u2019s corporate headquarters and operations are located in Shanghai and Beijing, China and City of San Diego, California, U.S., where any outbreak of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments could be materially adverse on the Company\u2019s business operations. In response to the highly contagious and sometimes fatal coronavirus inflicting thousands of people in China and the United States, the local government has imposed travel restrictions and quarantines/stay-at-home order to help control the spread of COVID-19.\nSince we primarily engage in the business of developing innovative small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer in humans, the outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly slowed down our research and studies due to the shortage of medical resources. Since clinical and medical resources are currently occupied by the tests and treatments of COVID-19, all clinical trial sites have reduced the acceptance of clinical trial patients. Patients with chronic diseases, such as lymphoma, have been advised to avoid visits to hospitals. Therefore, patient recruitment for our drug candidate has been slowed down. In addition, the Contracted Research Organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) we engaged require regular onsite visit to monitor and inspect the status of the clinical trials and collect medical feedbacks. The breakout of COVID-19 has caused a significant decrease in CROs onsite visits and most of our researchers are currently working remotely to reduce the exposure to the contagious illness.\nGiven that the outbreak has been gradually controlled in China, Company\u2019s Shanghai office and R&D center have resumed business since February 2020. However, if the COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States, the federal and state governments may impose additional measures further restricting travel within and outside of the United States and also impose the regions under mandatory quarantine. Similarly, the continued spread of COVID-19 globally could further adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nAll of our drug candidates are still in development. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize our drug candidates or experiences significant delays in doing so, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nAll of our drug candidates are still in development. One of our drug candidates is in clinical development and various others are in pre-clinical development. Our ability to generate revenues from our drug candidates is dependent on our receipt of regulatory approval and successfully commercializing such products, which may never occur. Each of our drug candidates will require additional pre-clinical and/or clinical development, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, development of manufacturing supply and capacity, substantial investment, and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenue from product sales. The success of our drug candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u25cf successful completion of pre-clinical and/or clinical studies;\n\u25cf successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;\n\u25cf receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for planned clinical trials, future clinical trials, or drug registrations, manufacturing, and commercialization;\n\u25cf successful completion of all safety studies required to obtain regulatory approval in China, the United States, and other jurisdictions for our drug candidates;\n\u25cf developing commercial manufacturing capabilities to the specifications for our drug candidates for clinical supply and commercial manufacturing;\n\u25cf making and maintaining arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property protection and/or regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates;\n\u25cf launching commercial sales of our drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf acceptance of the drug candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;\n\u25cf effectively competing with other therapies and alternative drugs;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u25cf successfully enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims; and\n\u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the drug candidates following regulatory approval.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to develop and commercialize its clinical-stage drug candidates, particularly abexinostat, which has three clinical trials currently on-going. As a result, our business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize abexinostat and other drug candidates in a timely manner.\nWe cannot commercialize drug candidates in the United States or another jurisdiction outside of China without obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Similarly, we cannot commercialize drug candidates in China without first obtaining regulatory approval from the NMPA. The process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize drug candidates is long, complex, and costly and approval may not be granted. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and obtaining regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Even if our drug candidates were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we would still need to seek approval in China and any other jurisdictions where we plan to market the product. Any safety issues, product recalls, or other incidents related to products approved and marketed in one jurisdiction may impact approval of those products by another jurisdiction. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations imposed on certain drug candidates, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of our drug candidates or any other drug candidate that we may in-license, acquire, or develop in the future.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval under applicable regulatory requirements.\nTo gain approval to market a drug product, regardless of whether it is through Accelerated Approval or the conventional pathway, we must provide the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies with clinical data that adequately demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the product for the intended indication applied for in the New Drug Application, or \u201cNDA,\u201d or other respective regulatory filing. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of any of our clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials even after promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical studies and trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported Adverse Events (\u201cAEs\u201d). Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we may conduct.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Failure can occur at any stage of clinical development.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of nonclinical and clinical studies and trials of our drug candidate may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical and clinical studies and trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies and trials, and we cannot be certain that it will not face similar setbacks. Based upon negative or inconclusive results, we or any potential future collaborator may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional nonclinical and clinical studies and trials. In addition, data obtained from trials and studies are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. Furthermore, we rely on contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and, while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\nIn addition, we do not know whether future clinical trials, if any, will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\u25cf obtain regulatory approval to commence a trial, if applicable;\n\u25cf reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf obtain ethics committee or institutional review board, or \u201cIRB,\u201d approval at each site;\n\u25cf recruit suitable patients to participate in a trial and have such patients complete the clinical trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf ensure that clinical sites follow the trial protocol, comply with Good Clinical Practice, or \u201cGCP,\u201d and continue to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u25cf address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a clinical trial;\n\u25cf ensure that patients comply with and complete clinical trial protocol;\n\u25cf achieve a sufficient level of endpoint events in the placebo group, if applicable;\n\u25cf initiate or add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf ensure that trial sites do not deviate from clinical trial protocol or drop out of a clinical trial;\n\u25cf address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u25cf manufacture sufficient quantities of drug candidate for use in clinical trials and ensure clinical trial material is provided to clinical sites in a timely manner; and\n\u25cf obtain the statistical analysis plan to be used to evaluate the clinical trial data.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by it, by the ethics committees or IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Such parties may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory agencies resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of physicians or enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries. In addition, the FDA may determine that clinical trial results obtained in foreign subjects do not represent the safety and efficacy of a product when administered in U.S. patients and are thus not supportive of an NDA approval in the United States.\nIf we experience delays in the start or completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects of our drug candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing its clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our drug candidates\u2019 development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of its drug candidates.\nWe may allocate our limited resources to pursue a particular drug candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on drug candidates or indications that may later prove to be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we must limit our licensing, research, and development programs to specific drug candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other drug candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities. In addition, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular drug candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that drug candidate through collaboration, licensing, or other royalty arrangements when it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such drug candidate.\nWe may attempt to secure approval of abexinostat from the FDA through the use of the Accelerated Approval Program, but such mechanism may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process. If we are unable to obtain approval of abexinostat through the Accelerated Approval Program in the United States, we may be required to conduct additional nonclinical and clinical studies and trials beyond those that we currently contemplate, which could increase the expense of obtaining, reduce the likelihood of obtaining, and/or delay the timing of obtaining, necessary marketing approval. Even if we receive approval from the FDA under the Accelerated Approval Program, if our confirmatory post-marketing trial does not verify clinical benefit, or if it does not comply with rigorous post-marketing requirements, the FDA may seek to withdraw the approval.\nWe currently plan to seek U.S. approval for our lead drug candidate, abexinostat, through the FDA\u2019s Accelerated Approval Program. For any approval to market a drug product, we must provide the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies with clinical data that adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product for the indication applied for in the NDA or other respective regulatory filings. As described in the section titled \u201cInformation about Xynomic-United States Regulation\u201d, the Accelerated Approval Program is one of several approaches used by the FDA to make prescription drugs more rapidly available for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases. Section 506(c) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the \u201cFFDCA,\u201d provides that the FDA may grant accelerated approval to \u201ca product for a serious or life-threatening condition upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.\u201d Approval under the Accelerated Approval Program is subject, however, to the requirement that the applicant conduct additional post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the drug\u2019s clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relationship of the surrogate endpoint to the clinical benefit, or of the observed clinical endpoint to ultimate outcome. Typically, clinical benefit is verified when post-marketing clinical trials show that the drug provides a clinically meaningful positive therapeutic effect, that is, an effect on how a patient feels, functions, or survives. The FDA may require that any confirmatory post-marketing trial be initiated or substantially underway prior to the submission of an application under the Accelerated Approval Program. And, if such confirmatory post-marketing trial fails to confirm the drug\u2019s clinical profile or risks and benefits, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug.\nThe FDA has broad discretion with regard to approval under the Accelerated Approval Program, and even if we believe that the Accelerated Approval Program is appropriate for abexinostat, it cannot assure you that the FDA will ultimately agree. Furthermore, even if we do obtain approval under the Accelerated Approval Program, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures.\nEven if we receive approval for abexinostat under the Accelerated Approval Program, we will be subject to rigorous post-marketing requirements, including the completion of one or more confirmatory post-marketing trials to verify the clinical benefit of the product, and submission to the FDA of all promotional materials prior to their dissemination. The FDA could seek to withdraw an accelerated approval for multiple reasons, including if we fail to conduct any required confirmatory post-marketing trial with due diligence, a confirmatory post-marketing trial does not confirm the predicted clinical benefit, other evidence shows that the product is not safe or effective under the conditions of use, or we disseminate promotional materials that are found by the FDA to be false and misleading.\nAny delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, approval under the Accelerated Approval Program would delay or prevent commercialization of abexinostat and would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain NMPA approval for our drug candidates to be eligible for an expedited registration pathway as Category 1 drug candidates, the time and cost we would incur to obtain regulatory approvals may increase. Even if we receive such Category 1 designation, it may not lead to a faster development, review or approval process.\nThe NMPA categorizes domestically-manufactured innovative drug applications as Category 1, provided such drug has a new and clearly defined structure, pharmacological property and apparent clinical value and has not been marketed anywhere in the world. Domestically developed and manufactured innovative drugs will be attributed to Category 1 for their CTA and NDA applications. Our clinical stage drug candidates are eligible for Category 1 designation. A Category 1 designation by the NMPA may not be granted for any of its drug candidates or may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval process. Moreover, a Category 1 designation does not increase the likelihood that its drug candidates will receive regulatory approval.\nThe regulatory process in China is evolving and subject to change. Any future policies, or changes to current polices, that the NMPA approves might require us to change our planned clinical study design or otherwise spend additional resources and effort to obtain approval of our drug candidates. In addition, policy changes may contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for certain age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for its drug candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of our drug candidates or any other drug candidate that we may in-license, acquire or develop in the future.\nThe research and development projects under our internal discovery programs are at an early stage of development. As a result, we are unable to predict if or when we will successfully develop or commercialize any drug candidates under such programs.\nOur internal discovery programs are at an early stage of development and will require significant investment and regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. We currently have no drug candidates beyond pre-clinical trials under its internal discovery programs. Each of our drug candidates will require additional clinical and pre-clinical development, management of clinical, pre-clinical and manufacturing activities, obtaining regulatory approval, obtaining manufacturing supply, building of a commercial organization, substantial investment, and significant marketing efforts before it generates any revenue from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our drug candidates before our receipt of regulatory approval from the FDA, NMPA, or comparable regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any such drug candidates.\nWe cannot be certain that clinical development of any drug candidates from our internal discovery programs will be successful or that we will obtain regulatory approval or be able to successfully commercialize any of our drug candidates and generate revenue. Success in pre-clinical testing does not ensure that clinical trials will be successful, and the clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our drug candidates are safe and effective for their proposed uses. Any such failure could cause us to abandon further development of any one or more of our drug candidates and may delay development of other drug candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay and possibly preclude the filing of any NDAs, with the FDA, NMPA, or comparable regulatory authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize its drug candidates and generate product revenue.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe commenced three clinical trials involving abexinostat. Timely completion of those clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who meet the trial criteria and remain in the trial until the conclusion. We may experience difficulties enrolling and retaining appropriate patients in its clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf the size and nature of the patient population;\n\u25cf patient eligibility criteria defined in the clinical protocol;\n\u25cf the size of study population required for statistical analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u25cf the proximity of patients to trial sites;\n\u25cf the design of the trial and changes to the design of the trial;\n\u25cf our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u25cf competing clinical trials for similar therapies or other new therapeutics, which will reduce the number and types of patients available;\n\u25cf clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and side effects of the drug candidates being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drug candidates or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u25cf patients enrolled in clinical trials that may not complete a clinical trial; and\n\u25cf the availability of approved therapies that are similar to our drug candidates.\nEven if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in its clinical trials, delays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect its ability to advance the development of our drug candidates.\nWe have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and results of earlier studies and trials may not be reproduced in future clinical trials.\nFor our drug candidates, clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, while failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of studies in animals and early clinical trials of our drug candidates may not predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through studies in animals and initial clinical trials. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same drug candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations (including genetic differences), patient adherence to the dosing regimen and the patient dropout rate. Results in later trials may also differ from earlier trials due to a larger number of clinical trial sites and additional countries and languages involved in such trials. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a drug candidate, and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced and significant expense has been incurred.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of demonstrated efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. Furthermore, if the trials we conduct fail to meet their primary statistical and clinical endpoints, they will not support the approval from the FDA, NMPA, EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities for its drug candidates. If this occurs, we would need to replace the failed study with new trials, which would require significant additional expense, cause substantial delays in commercialization and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nResults from completed human clinical trials may not be representative of the results that are obtained after approval, if obtained, and product launch.\nHuman clinical trials are very complicated undertakings. If we obtain FDA approval under the Accelerated Approval Program, safety risks not identified in our prior clinical trials may first appear after we obtain approval and commercializes our drug candidates. Any new post-marketing AEs may significantly impact our ability to market our drug candidates and may require that we recall and discontinue commercialization of our drug candidates. Furthermore, if any confirmatory post-marketing trial fails to confirm a drug candidate\u2019s clinical profile or clinical benefits, the FDA may withdraw its approval. Any of these events would materially harm our business.\nOur drug candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following regulatory approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause it to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials or could cause regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt its clinical trials or could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the NMPA, FDA, or other regulatory authorities. In particular, as is the case with all oncology drugs, it is likely that there may be side effects, such as fatigue, nausea, and low blood cell levels, associated with the use of certain of our oncology drug candidates. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, and prospects significantly.\nClinical trials assess a sample of the potential patient population. With a limited number of patients and duration of exposure, rare and severe side effects of our drug candidates may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the drug candidate. If our drug candidates receive regulatory approval and we, our partners, or others identify undesirable side effects caused by such drug candidates (or any other similar drugs) after such approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf the NMPA, FDA, or other comparable regulatory authorities may withdraw or limit their approval of such drug candidates;\n\u25cf the NMPA, FDA, or other comparable regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cboxed\u201d warning or a contra-indication;\n\u25cf we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way such drug candidates are distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical trials, or change the labeling of our drug candidates;\n\u25cf the NMPA, FDA, or other comparable regulatory authorities may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS (or analogous requirement), plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools;\n\u25cf we may be subject to regulatory investigations and government enforcement actions;\n\u25cf we may decide to remove such drug candidates from the marketplace;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for injury caused to individuals exposed to or taking our drug candidates; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected drug candidates and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our drug candidates, if approved, and significantly impact our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates and generate revenue.\nOur clinical development program may not uncover all possible AEs that patients may experience. The number of subjects exposed to our drug candidates and the average exposure time in the clinical development program may be inadequate to detect AEs, or chance findings, that may only be detected once our drug candidates are administered to more patients and for greater periods of time.\nClinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. With a limited number of subjects and limited duration of exposure, however, we cannot be fully assured that any of our drug candidates has no serious or severe side effects, and any such side effects may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the drug candidate. It is possible that ongoing and future clinical trials, as well as reports received from commercial use, if any of our drug candidates are approved, may identify safety concerns.\nAlthough we have monitored the subjects in our trials for certain safety concerns and it has not seen evidence of significant safety concerns in our clinical trials to date, patients treated with any of our drug candidates may experience adverse reactions. If safety problems occur or are identified after a product candidate reaches the market, the FDA may require that we amend the labeling or conduct recall. The FDA could also request that we withdraw a product form the market, or seek to withdraw its approval of a product.\nThe incidence and prevalence for target patient populations of our drug candidates are based on estimates and third-party sources. If the market opportunities for our drug candidates are smaller than we estimate or if any approval that we obtain is based on a narrower definition of the patient population, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability might be materially and adversely affected.\nPeriodically, we make estimates regarding the incidence and prevalence of target patient populations for particular diseases based on various third-party sources and internally generated analysis and use such estimates in making decisions regarding our drug development strategy, including acquiring or in-licensing drug candidates and determining indications on which to focus in pre-clinical or clinical trials.\nThese estimates may be inaccurate or based on imprecise data. The total addressable market opportunity for abexinostat and our other drug candidates will ultimately depend upon, among other things, the diagnosis criteria included in the final label for each of our drug candidates, acceptance by the medical community and patient access, drug pricing and reimbursement. The number of patients in the major markets and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our drugs, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in our competitors discovering, developing, or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than we do, or develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours.\nThe development and commercialization of new drugs are highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current drug candidates, and will face competition with respect to any drug candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. For example, there are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are currently marketing drugs or are pursuing the development of therapies in the field of HDAC inhibition to treat cancer. Some of these competitive drugs and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our drug candidates. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization.\nSpecifically, there are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer. If abexinostat receives marketing approval for renal cell carcinoma (\u201cRCC\u201d), follicular lymphoma (\u201cFL\u201d), and/or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (\u201cDLBCL\u201d), it may face competition from approved drugs marketed by Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, and Pfizer Inc. If XP-102 receives marketing approval for patients with colorectal cancer or melanoma, it will face competition from Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Roche AG, and potentially other companies.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing against or which we may compete against in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than us. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of its competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, its programs.\nOur commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, with fewer or less severe side effects, more convenient, or less expensive than drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, NMPA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our drugs, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential drug candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our drug candidates against competitors.\nEven if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success, which will depend, in part, upon the degree of acceptance among physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups, health care payors, and the medical community.\nEven if we obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals, our drug candidates may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups, health care payors, or the medical community, and may not be commercially successful. If approved, market acceptance of our drug candidates depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects and overall safety profile of the product;\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u25cf the potential and perceived advantages of our drug candidates over current options or future alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the strength of our marketing organization and distribution channels;\n\u25cf the quality of our relationships with patient advocacy groups;\n\u25cf the availability and sufficiency of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u25cf acceptance by physicians, major operators of clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective chronic daily treatment and willingness of physicians to prescribe our drug candidates;\n\u25cf the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for our drug candidates, if approved, on the part of patients;\n\u25cf relative convenience and ease of administration of our drug candidates; and\n\u25cf the availability of the product and our ability to meet market demand, including providing a reliable supply for long-term daily treatment.\nAny failure by our drug candidates, if they obtain regulatory approval, to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf any of our drug candidates are approved for marketing and commercialization and we are unable to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities on our own or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions on acceptable terms, we will be unable to successfully commercialize any such future therapeutics.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution capabilities or experience. In order to commercialize our drug candidates, if approved, we must build marketing and sales capabilities or make arrangement with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. Building the requisite sales, marketing or distribution capabilities will be expensive and time-consuming and will require significant attention of our leadership team to manage. Any failure or delay in the development of our sales, marketing or distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products. The competition for talented individuals experienced in selling and marketing pharmaceutical products is intense, and we cannot assure you that we can assemble an effective team. Additionally, we may choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties on the commercialization of our drug candidates. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our drug candidates if and when we receive regulatory approval or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations.\nWe may be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries either ourselves or through a third-party, including:\n\u25cf differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf economic weakness, including inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u25cf potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u25cf challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u25cf production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u25cf business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism.\nIf we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for our drug candidates by third-party payors, sales would be adversely affected.\nWe expect patients who have cancer to need chronic treatment but we anticipate that most patients will rely on coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor, such as Medicare, Medicaid or a private health insurer, to pay for such treatment. There will be no commercially viable market for our drug candidates without coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Additionally, even if we obtain third-party payor coverage and reimbursement for our drug candidates, if the level of coverage and reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor can be an expensive and time-consuming process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We cannot be certain if and when it will obtain formulary approval to allow us to sell our drug candidates, if approved, into its target markets. Even if we obtain formulary approval, third-party payors, may carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, drugs. Reimbursement rates from third-party payors vary depending on the payor, the insurance plan and other factors. A current trend in the United States health care industry is toward cost containment. Large public and private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, are questioning the coverage of, and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of, or reimbursement for, newly approved health care products.\nIn addition, there may be significant delays in obtaining such coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses.\nWe cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for its drug candidates and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nReimbursement may impact the demand for, and the price of, our drug candidates, if approved. Assuming we obtain coverage for its drug candidates by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use our drug candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of such drug candidates. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, China and other countries will put pressure on the pricing and usage of its drug candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicinal products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our drug candidates, if approved. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our drug candidates compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the research, clinical and business development expertise of Yinglin Mark Xu, its Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President; Wentao Jason Wu, its Chief Operating Officer; as well as the other principal members of its management, scientific, and clinical team. We have not entered into employment letter agreements with all of its executive officers. Under the employment agreements we have entered with executive officers, any of them may terminate his or her employment with it at any time. We do not maintain key person insurance for any of its executives or other employees. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist it in formulating its research, development, and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, its ability to pursue its growth strategy will be limited. While we are working on rectifying its failure to put proper employment arrangements in place in the past for certain senior management positions, it is uncertain that such failure could be retroactively rectified completely.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified management, scientific, clinical, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of its executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development, and commercialization objectives and seriously harm its ability to successfully implement its business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of, and commercialize drugs. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain, or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, even though Dr. James Jiayuan Tong, the current Bison Chief Executive Officer, remains as a Chief Strategy Officer at the combined entity, our management will be required to devote significant time to new compliance initiatives from its status as a U.S. public company, which may require it to recruit more management personnel. Failure to succeed in clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.\nWe will need to develop and expand our business, and we may encounter difficulties in managing this development and expansion, which could disrupt its operations.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, there were 27 full-time and 8 part-time employees and consultants in our total staff headcount of 35. To manage its anticipated development and expansion, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational, and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. If our management is unable to effectively manage its expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our drug candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of the Company.\nProduct liability claims or lawsuits could cause us to incur substantial liabilities.\nWe will face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any drug candidates that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our drug candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nOur Current Charter provides for an exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, which may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for such disputes and may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nOur Current Charter specifies that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or agents to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided that, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or rules and regulations thereunder. We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, these provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.\nOur internal IT systems, or those of our third-party CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of its drug candidates\u2019 development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal IT systems and those of its third-party CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in its operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data for its drug candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to its data or applications or other data or applications relating to its technology or drug candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including health information collected through clinical trials, we could incur liabilities and the further development of its drug candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we may not obtain approval under the Accelerated Approval Program or the conventional pathway, as required for the commercialization.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, pricing and reimbursement, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor any future collaboration partner is permitted to market a drug product in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA. We have not submitted an application or obtained marketing approval for any drug candidate anywhere in the world. Obtaining regulatory approval of an NDA, even under the Accelerated Approval Program, can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or other actions, including:\n\u25cf warning letters;\n\u25cf civil and criminal penalties;\n\u25cf injunctions;\n\u25cf withdrawal of regulatory approval of products;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention;\n\u25cf product recalls;\n\u25cf total or partial suspension of production; and\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a drug candidate in the United States or abroad, We or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies, that such drug candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. The number of nonclinical and clinical studies and trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. We may seek approval for one or more drug candidates under the FDA\u2019s Accelerated Approval Program, which would allow it to demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, but it will be subject to rigorous post-marketing requirements, including the completion of one or more confirmatory post-marketing trials to verify the clinical benefit of the product candidate. If unable to obtain approval under the Accelerated Approval Program, we will have to pursue a conventional approval pathway. In addition, in such case, the FDA could determine that any pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials we have conducted are not sufficient to support approval under the conventional pathway. Results from nonclinical and clinical trials and studies can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our drug candidate is promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Administering drug candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory agencies denying approval of a drug candidate for any or all targeted indications.\nBoth accelerated and conventional regulatory approval pathways of an NDA or NDA supplement are not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the approval process and we may encounter matters with the FDA that require us to expend additional time and resources and delay or prevent the approval of our drug candidates. For example, the FDA may require us to conduct additional studies or trials either prior to approval or post-marketing, such as additional drug-drug interaction studies or safety or efficacy studies or trials, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program such as the number of subjects enrolled in its current clinical trials from the United States. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf a drug candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u25cf the FDA might not approve our trial design and analysis plan;\n\u25cf the FDA may not find the data from nonclinical and clinical studies and trials sufficient;\n\u25cf clinical inspection(s) by the FDA or other regulatory authorities may result in unacceptable findings that could negatively impact approval;\n\u25cf the FDA might not accept or deem acceptable a third-party manufacturers\u2019 processes or facilities; or\n\u25cf the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf we fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, our business and results of operations will be materially and adversely harmed. Additionally, if the FDA requires that we conduct additional clinical trials, places limitations on product use in our FDA-approved labeling, delays approval to market or limits the use of any drug candidate, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe are conducting and may in the future conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nAlthough the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States in support of safety and efficacy claims, this is subject to certain conditions. For example, such foreign clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with GCPs, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and obtaining the informed consent from subjects of the clinical trials. The foreign clinical data should also be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice. Other factors that may affect the acceptance of foreign clinical data include differences in clinical conditions, study populations or regulatory requirements between the United States and the foreign country. To the extent that we have conducted, are conducting, and will conduct trials with majority enrollment outside the United States, the FDA may not accept our foreign clinical data, and in such event, we may be required to re-conduct the relevant clinical trials within the United States, which would be costly and time-consuming, and which could have a material and adverse effect on its ability to carry out its business plans.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our drug candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experiences unanticipated problems.\nEven if a drug is approved by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory agencies, regulatory agencies may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose various ongoing requirements. Furthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays or increased costs to assure compliance. In addition, if a drug receives approval under the FDA\u2019s Accelerated Approval Program, it will be subject to special post-marketing requirements, including the completion of confirmatory post-marketing clinical trials to verify the clinical benefit of the product, and submission to the FDA of all promotional materials prior to their dissemination. The FDA could seek to withdraw the approval for multiple reasons, including if we fail to conduct any required confirmatory post-marketing trial with due diligence, a confirmatory post-marketing trial does not confirm the predicted clinical benefit, other evidence shows that the product is not safe or effective under the conditions of use, or we disseminate promotional materials that are found by the FDA to be false and misleading.\nIf any of our drug candidates receives approval under the Accelerated Approval Program, it will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for conducting post-marketing clinical studies and trials, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States. In addition, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the current Good Manufacturing Practices, or \u201ccGMP\u201d. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we must conduct the confirmatory post-marketing trial in a diligent manner and we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. As such, we may not promote any product, if approved, for indications or uses for which it does not have FDA approval.\nIf any of our product candidates receives approval under the Accelerated Approval Program but we fail to conduct the required confirmatory post-marketing trials with due diligence or such post-marketing trials fail to confirm the clinical profile or risks and benefits, the FDA may withdraw its approval. If a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, if approved, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing, or labeling of a product, the regulatory agency may impose restrictions on the product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n\u25cf issue warning letters;\n\u25cf impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf suspend regulatory approval;\n\u25cf suspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u25cf impose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u25cf seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenues. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to generate revenues from the sale of any of product candidates, if approved, our potential for achieving profitability will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nThe regulatory requirements and policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted for which we may also be required to comply. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other countries. If we or any future collaboration partner are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or such collaboration partner, as applicable, may face government enforcement action and our business will suffer.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business or our reputation.\nWe are subject to the FCPA. The FCPA generally prohibits us from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions, particularly China. As our business expands, the applicability of the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws to our operations will increase. Our procedures and controls to monitor anti-bribery compliance may fail to protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we, due to either our own deliberate or inadvertent acts or those of others, fails to comply with applicable anti-bribery laws, our reputation could be harmed and we could incur criminal or civil penalties, other sanctions and/or significant expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nOur business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.\nWe may from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and others and it may become subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and legal proceedings is difficult to predict, defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, costs and significant payments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we or our current or future collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our products and may harm our reputation.\nAlthough we do not currently have any products on the market, once our drug candidates or clinical trials are covered by federal health care programs, we will be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal, state and foreign governments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any therapeutic candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell or distribute our therapeutic candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for a healthcare item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u25cf the U.S. federal False Claims Act, which imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u25cf HIPAA includes a fraud and abuse provision referred to as the HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Law, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program (i.e., not just federal healthcare programs), or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which impose obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act and the implementing regulations, also referred to as \u201cOpen Payments,\u201d issued under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, which require that manufacturers of pharmaceutical and biological drugs reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program report to the Department of Health and Human Services all consulting fees, travel reimbursements, research grants, and other payments, transfers of value or gifts made to U.S.-licensed physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals with limited exceptions; and\n\u25cf analogous state laws and regulations, such as, state anti-kickback and false claims laws potentially applicable to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state transparency laws that require the reporting of certain pricing information; among other state laws.\nEnsuring that our future business arrangements with third-parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, we may be subject to penalties, including civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely affect its financial results. Although an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause it to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of its business, even if its defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nIf we or our current or future collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect its ability to develop, market and sell its therapeutics successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of its therapeutics by the market. These enforcement actions include, among others:\n\u25cf adverse regulatory inspection findings;\n\u25cf warning or untitled letters;\n\u25cf voluntary product recalls or public notification or medical product safety alerts to healthcare professionals;\n\u25cf restrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing our therapeutics;\n\u25cf restrictions on, or prohibitions against, importation or exportation of our therapeutics;\n\u25cf suspension of review or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u25cf exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs;\n\u25cf exclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our therapeutics;\n\u25cf FDA debarment;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of therapeutic approvals;\n\u25cf seizures or administrative detention of therapeutics;\n\u25cf injunctions; and\n\u25cf civil and criminal penalties and fines.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated in the U.S. at the federal, state, and local levels, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject us to penalties and negatively affect our financial condition.\nAs a healthcare company, our operations, clinical trial activities and interactions with healthcare providers may be subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., particularly if the Company receives FDA approval for any of its therapeutics in the future. For example, if we receive FDA approval for a therapeutic for which reimbursement is available under a federal healthcare program (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), we would be subject to a variety of federal laws and regulations, including those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims for payment by federal healthcare programs (e.g., the False Claims Act), prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable by federal healthcare programs (e.g., the federal Anti-Kickback Statute), and require disclosure of certain payments or other transfers of value made to U.S.-licensed physicians and teaching hospitals, or Open Payments. We are not able to predict how third parties will interpret these laws and apply applicable governmental guidance and may challenge our practices and activities under one or more of these laws. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, which could hurt our business, our operations and financial condition.\nSimilarly, HIPAA prohibits, among other offenses, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for items or services under a health care benefit program. To the extent that it acts as a business associate to a healthcare provider engaging in electronic transactions, we may also be subject to the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which restricts the use and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient-identifiable health information, and requires the reporting of certain security breaches to healthcare provider customers with respect to such information. Additionally, many states have enacted similar laws that may impose more stringent requirements on entities like us. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in substantial penalties and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf approved, our product candidates may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that it is required to report to regulatory agencies and if we fail to do so it could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm its business.\nIf we are successful in commercializing any product candidate, FDA and most foreign regulatory agency regulations require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if the product may have caused or contributed to those AEs. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report AEs within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of a product, if approved. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency could take action, including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and seizure of our products, if approved.\nOur ability to obtain services, reimbursement or funding from the federal government may be impacted by possible reductions in federal spending.\nU.S. federal government agencies currently face potentially significant spending reductions. The Budget Control Act of 2011, or the \u201cBCA,\u201d established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which was tasked with achieving a reduction in the federal debt level of at least $1.2 trillion. That committee did not draft a proposal by the BCA\u2019s deadline. As a result, automatic cuts, referred to as sequestration, in various federal programs were scheduled to take place, beginning in January 2013, although the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 delayed the BCA\u2019s automatic cuts until March 1, 2013. While the Medicare program\u2019s eligibility and scope of benefits are generally exempt from these cuts, Medicare payments to providers and Part D health plans are not exempt. The BCA did, however, provide that the Medicare cuts to providers and Part D health plans would not exceed two percent. President Obama issued the sequestration order on March 1, 2013, and cuts went into effect on April 1, 2013. Additionally, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended sequestration for Medicare through fiscal year 2027.\nThe U.S. federal budget remains in flux, which could, among other things, cut Medicare payments to providers. Although the BBA passed in February 2018 enacts a two-year federal spending agreement and raises the federal spending cap on non-defense spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, the Medicare program is frequently identified as a target for spending cuts. The full impact on our business of any future cuts in Medicare or other programs is uncertain. In addition, we cannot predict any impact President Trump\u2019s administration and the U.S. Congress may have on the federal budget. If federal spending is reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health, to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve therapeutic research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market, and sell any drugs it may develop.\nOur business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.\nWe may from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and others and it may become subject to claims and other actions related to its business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and legal proceedings is difficult to predict, defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, costs and significant payments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nLegislative or regulatory FDA reforms in the United States may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval and to produce, market and distribute its products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our drug candidates. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our drug candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u25cf additional clinical trials to be conducted prior to obtaining approval;\n\u25cf changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u25cf recall, replacement, or discontinuance of our drug candidates, if approved; and\n\u25cf additional record keeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals would harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the United States and some foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products, if approved, and profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access.\nIn the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d), which contains provisions that may potentially reduce the profitability of products, including, for example, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 share of sales to federal health care programs. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to the PPACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the PPACA, including the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d In the future, there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA. It remains to be seen precisely what new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted, and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, including the cost of pharmaceutical products.\nAdditionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to end Medicare Part B coverage of medications and to shift those medication costs to Medicare Part D, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize its drug candidates for which it may receive regulatory approval in the future.\nAny therapeutics we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third party coverage and reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new therapeutics vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a therapeutic before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or therapeutic licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. Although we intend to monitor these regulations, our programs are currently in the early stages of development and we will not be able to assess the impact of price regulations for a number of years. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a therapeutic in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay its commercial launch of the therapeutic and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the therapeutic in that country.\nOur ability to commercialize any therapeutics successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these therapeutics and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. However, there may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for newly-approved therapeutics. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not necessarily signify that a therapeutic will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution costs. Also, interim payments for new therapeutics, if applicable, may be insufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Thus, even if we succeed in bringing one or more therapeutics to the market, these therapeutics may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any therapeutics may be insufficient to allow us to sell its therapeutics on a competitive basis. Because its programs are in the early stages of development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost effectiveness or the likely level or method of reimbursement. Increasingly, the third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are seeking greater upfront discounts, additional rebates and other concessions to reduce the prices for therapeutics. If the price we are able to charge for any therapeutics it develops, or the reimbursement provided for such therapeutics, is inadequate in light of its development and other costs, its return on investment could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that the efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare, and specifically, therapeutics, and legislative and regulatory proposals to broaden the availability of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. A number of legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare system in the U.S. and other major healthcare markets have been proposed. These developments could, directly or indirectly, affect our ability to sell its therapeutics, if approved, at a favorable price.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe depend on third party manufacturers for the manufacture of our drug candidates as well as on third parties for our supply chain, and if we experience problems with any of these third parties, the manufacture of our drug candidates or products could be delayed, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our drug candidates, such reliance entails risks to which we would not be subject to if we manufactured drug candidates or products ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our drug candidates or any products we may eventually commercialize in accordance with its specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA, NMPA and other regulatory authorities require that our drug candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to the current Good Manufacturing Practices, or \u201ccGMP,\u201d standards. Any failure by its third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP standards or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of drug candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA, NMPA, or other regulatory authorities to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for drug candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention or product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, or imposing civil and criminal penalties.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our drug candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to conduct, monitor and/or manage some of our ongoing pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and controls only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on third parties to assist in conducting our pre-clinical studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices, or \u201cGLP,\u201d and the Administrative Regulations on Experimental Animals, or the Animal Welfare Act requirements. We and our CROs are required to comply with GCP, regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, NMPA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our drug candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in its clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, NMPA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving its marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of its clinical trials comply with International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice, or \u201cICH-GCP,\u201d requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under the cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat pre-clinical and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs. We cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, non-clinical, and pre-clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain are compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize its drug candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for its drug candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or compromised.\nIf we lose our relationships with CROs, our drug development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and CROs for some of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials related to our drug development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management\u2019s time and focus. Our CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. As the date hereof, we are in arbitration with one CRO regarding disputes on invoices addressed to us and have a lawsuit with another CRO for breach of contract as a result of unpaid invoices. For more details about the legal proceedings with the CROs, please see \u201cItem 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d on page 87. In addition, some of our CROs have the ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors, or if we are liquidated. Identifying, qualifying, and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult and time-consuming, and will cause delays in its development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs are terminated, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, and we may not be able to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nOur employees, principal investigators, CROs, and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, principal investigators, CROs, and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d), and other regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities, healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to its reputation. We intend to adopt, prior to the completion of the Merger, a code of conduct, and other applicable policies and procedures, applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of its operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate its business and its results of operations.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nWe face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our results of operations.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, health epidemics or other public safety concerns affecting the PRC, and particularly Shanghai. Natural disasters may give rise to server interruptions to construction business as well as adversely affect our ability to operate our production facility. In recent years, there have been outbreaks of epidemics in China and globally, such as the coronavirus originated in Wuhan city at the end of 2019, H1N1 flu, avian flu or another epidemic. China has resulted in travel disruption and has affected certain companies\u2019 operations in China. Our business operations could be disrupted by any of these epidemics. In addition, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that any health epidemic harms the Chinese economy in general. A prolonged outbreak of any of these illnesses or other adverse public health developments in China or elsewhere in the world could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. Such outbreaks could significantly impact the construction and transportation industries, which could severely disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our headquarter is located in Shanghai, where our management and employees currently reside. Our suppliers and research collaborators also have operations in locations exposed to similar dangers. Consequently, if any natural disasters, health epidemics or other public safety concerns were to affect Shanghai or cause travel restriction in or out of Shanghai or its surrounding areas, our operation may experience material disruptions, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain.\nPharmaceutical companies in China are required to comply with extensive regulations and hold a number of permits and licenses to carry on their business. Our ability to obtain and maintain these regulatory approvals is uncertain, and future government regulation may place additional burdens on our efforts to commercialize our drug candidates.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in China is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision. The regulatory framework addresses all aspects of operating in the pharmaceutical industry, including approval, registration, production, distribution, packaging, labelling, storage and shipment, advertising, licensing and certification requirements and procedures, periodic renewal and reassessment processes, registration of new drugs, and environmental protection. Violation of applicable laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business. In order to commercialize its drug candidates and manufacture and distribute pharmaceutical products in China, we are required to:\n\u25cf obtain a pharmaceutical manufacturing permit and Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201cGMP\u201d) certificate for each production facility from the NMPA and its relevant branches for trading and distribution of drugs not manufactured by the drug registration certificate holder;\n\u25cf obtain a drug registration certificate, which includes a drug approval number, from the NMPA for each drug manufactured by it;\n\u25cf obtain a pharmaceutical distribution permit and good supply practice, or \u201cGSP,\u201d certificate from the NMPA and its relevant branches; and\n\u25cf renew the pharmaceutical manufacturing permits, the pharmaceutical distribution permits, drug registration certificates, GMP certificates, and GSP certificates every five years, among other requirements.\nIf we are unable to obtain or renew such permits or any other permits or licenses required for its operations, we will not be able to engage in the commercialization, manufacture, and distribution of our drug candidates and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe regulatory framework governing the pharmaceutical industry in China is subject to changes and amendments from time to time. In recent years, the regulatory framework in China regarding the pharmaceutical industry has undergone significant changes, and we expect that it will continue to undergo significant changes. Any such changes or amendments may result in increased compliance costs on its business or cause delays in or prevent the successful development or commercialization of its drug candidates in China and reduce the current benefits we believe are available to us from developing and manufacturing drugs in China. Chinese authorities have become increasingly vigilant in enforcing laws in the pharmaceutical industry and any failure by us or our partners to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations or obtain and maintain required licenses and permits may result in the suspension or termination of its business activities in China. We believe our strategy and approach is aligned with the Chinese government\u2019s policies, but we cannot ensure that its strategy and approach will continue to be aligned.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations of the PRC, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations primarily occur in China and involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemical materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We are therefore subject to PRC laws and regulations concerning the discharge of waste water, gaseous waste, and solid waste during its processes of research and development of drugs. Although we engage competent third-party contractors for the transfer and disposal of these materials and wastes, we may not at all times comply fully with environmental regulations. Any violation of these regulations may result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, revocations of operating permits, shutdown of its facilities, and obligation to take corrective measures. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials and wastes. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or discharge of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed its resources. we also could incur significant costs associated with civil, administrative, or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover costs and expenses incurred due to on-the-job injuries to our employees and third-party liability insurance for injuries caused by unexpected seepage, pollution, or contamination, such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, the PRC government may take steps towards the adoption of more stringent environmental regulations. Due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments, the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated. If there is any unanticipated change in the environmental regulations, we may need to incur substantial capital expenditures to install, replace, upgrade, or supplement our manufacturing facility and equipment or make operational changes to limit any adverse impact or potential adverse impact on the environment in order to comply with new environmental protection laws and regulations. If such costs become prohibitively expensive, we may be forced to cease certain aspects of our business operations.\nThe audit report for Xynomic Pharma\u2019s financial statements for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 included in this annual report is prepared by an auditor who is not inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, as such, our investors are deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nThe independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this report, is located in China, a jurisdiction where the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the PRC authorities, such auditor is not currently inspected by the PCAOB.\nIn May 2013, the PCAOB announced that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Enforcement Cooperation with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, and the PRC Ministry of Finance, which establishes a cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations undertaken by the PCAOB, the CSRC or the PRC Ministry of Finance in the United States and the PRC, respectively. The PCAOB continues to be in discussions with the CSRC and the PRC Ministry of Finance to permit joint inspections in the PRC of audit firms that are registered with PCAOB and audit Chinese companies that trade on U.S. exchanges.\nOn December 7, 2018, the SEC and the PCAOB issued a joint statement highlighting continued challenges faced by the U.S. regulators in their oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China.\nOn April 21, 2020, the SEC and the PCAOB issued another joint statement reiterating the greater risk that disclosures will be insufficient in many emerging markets, including China, compared to those made by U.S. domestic companies. In discussing the specific issues related to the greater risk, the statement again highlights the PCAOB\u2019s inability to inspect audit work papers and practices of accounting firms in China, with respect to their audit work of U.S. reporting companies. However, it remains unclear what further actions, if any, the SEC and the PCAOB will take to address the problem.\nInspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. This lack of PCAOB inspections in China prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditor\u2019s audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections.\nThe inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s procedures or quality control procedures to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections including our auditor that issues the audit report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 included elsewhere in this report. As a result, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIf additional remedial measures are imposed on the \u201cbig four\u201d PRC-based accounting firms, including Xynomic Pharma\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm for the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, in administrative proceedings brought by the SEC alleging those firms\u2019 failure to meet specific criteria set by the SEC with respect to requests for the production of documents, we could be unable to assure you that would not impact Xynomic Pharma\u2019s financial statements for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nStarting in 2011, the PRC affiliates of the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms, including Xynomic Pharma\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report included in this annual report for the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, were affected by a conflict between U.S. and PRC law. Specifically, for certain U.S. listed companies operating and audited in mainland China, the SEC and the PCAOB sought to obtain from the PRC-based accounting firms access to their audit work papers and related documents. The firms were, however, advised and directed that under PRC law they could not respond directly to the U.S. regulators on those requests, and that requests by foreign regulators for access to such papers in China had to be channeled through the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC.\nIn late 2012, this impasse led the SEC to commence administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and also under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 against the PRC-based accounting firms, including Xynomic Pharma\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report included in this annual report for the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. In January 2014, the administrative law judge reached an initial decision to impose penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice before the SEC. The accounting firms filed a petition for review of the initial decision. In February 2015, before a review by the commissioners of the SEC had taken place, the firms reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the settlement, the SEC accepts that future requests by the SEC for the production of documents will normally be made to the CSRC. The firms were to receive matching Section 106 requests, and were required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such requests, which in substance required them to facilitate production via the CSRC. Under the terms of the settlement, the underlying proceeding against the four China-based accounting firms was deemed dismissed with prejudice four years after entry of the settlement. The four-year mark occurred on February 6, 2019. While we cannot predict if the SEC will further challenge the four China-based accounting firms\u2019 compliance with U.S. law in connection with U.S. regulatory requests for audit work papers or if the results of such a challenge would result in the SEC imposing penalties such as suspensions. If additional remedial measures are imposed on the Chinese affiliates of the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms, including Xynomic Pharma\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report included in this annual report for the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we could not assure you that would not impact Xynomic Pharma\u2019s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018; and subsequently impact the trading of our securities and our compliance with the SEC reporting and registration of securities.\nThe PRC\u2019s economic, political, and social conditions, as well as governmental policies, could affect the business environment and financial markets in China, and our ability to operate its business, maintain its liquidity, and keep our access to capital.\nA significant portion of our operations are conducted in China. Accordingly, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by economic, political, legal, and social conditions in China. China\u2019s economy differs from the economies of developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange, and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth over the past 30 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of China. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are currently applicable to it. In addition, in the past the PRC government implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and results of operation. More generally, if the business environment in China deteriorates from the perspective of domestic or international investment, our business in China may also be adversely affected.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system and changes in laws, regulations, and policies in China could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe conduct our business primarily through our subsidiaries in China. PRC laws and regulations govern our operations in China. Our subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China, which may not sufficiently cover all of the aspects of our economic activities in China. In addition, the implementation of laws and regulations may be in part based on government policies and internal rules that are subject to the interpretation and discretion of different government agencies (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not always be aware of any potential violation of these policies and rules. Such unpredictability regarding its contractual, property, and procedural rights could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations. Furthermore, since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy in Chinese legal system than in more developed legal systems. These uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nRestrictions on dividend distribution and currency exchange may limit our PRC Subsidiaries to distribute dividend to us or limit our ability to utilize revenues generated by our PRC subsidiaries effectively.\nA portion of our future revenue potentially will be generated by our PRC subsidiaries. Under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries, each of which is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, may pay dividends only out of its respective accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a certain statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. Such reserve funds cannot be distributed to us as dividends.\nIn addition, our PRC subsidiaries will generate primarily all of their revenue in RMB and the Chinese government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Such control and restrictions could affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to us for us to pay dividends or make other payments or otherwise to satisfy our foreign currency denominated obligations. The RMB is currently convertible under the \u201ccurrent account,\u201d which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the \u201ccapital account,\u201d which includes foreign direct investment and loans, including loans that we may secure from our PRC subsidiaries. Currently, our PRC subsidiaries may purchase foreign currency for settlement of \u201ccurrent account transactions,\u201d including payment of dividends to us, without the approval of the state administration of foreign exchange, or the \u201cSAFE.\u201d, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, in response to the persistent capital outflow in China and the RMB\u2019s depreciation against the U.S. dollar, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities have tightened up their control over currency exchange. Any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange could limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside of China or pay dividends in US dollars to our shareholders. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, SAFE and other relevant Chinese governmental authorities. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for our subsidiaries. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other kinds of payments to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use financing in foreign currencies effectively.\nOur PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to obtain foreign exchange is subject to significant foreign exchange controls and, in the case of transactions under the capital account, requires the approval of and/or registration with PRC government authorities, including the SAFE. In particular, if we finance its PRC subsidiaries by means of foreign debts from us or other foreign lenders, the amount is not allowed to, among other things, exceed the statutory limits and such loans must be registered with the local counterpart of the SAFE. If we finance its PRC subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, the amount of these capital contributions must first be approved or filed by the relevant government approval authority.\nIn light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that it will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approval on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans or capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approval, our ability to use the proceeds we receive from this offering and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nAny failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for our employee equity incentive plans may subject it to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2012, the SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies, or the Stock Option Rules. In accordance with the Stock Option Rules and relevant rules and regulations, PRC citizens or non-PRC citizens residing in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas listed company, and complete certain procedures. Our PRC subsidiaries and our employees who are PRC citizens or who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year and who participate in our stock incentive plan will be subject to such regulation. We plan to assist our employees to register their share options or shares. However, any failure of our PRC individual beneficial owners and holders of share options or shares to comply with the SAFE registration requirements may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may limit the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to distribute dividends to us. we also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict its ability to adopt additional incentive plans for our directors and employees under PRC law.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we breach a license agreement or other intellectual property-related agreements for our drug candidates or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with its licensors, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of ours drug candidates.\nOur business relies, in large part, on our ability to develop and commercialize drug candidates it has licensed and sublicensed from third parties, including abexinostat from Pharmacyclics and XP-102 and XP-105 from Boehringer Ingelheim. If our licensors breach such agreements, we may not be able to enforce such agreements against our licensors\u2019 parent entity or affiliates. Under each of our licenses and intellectual property-related agreements, in exchange for licensing or sublicensing to Xynomic the right to develop and commercialize the applicable drug candidates, our licensors will be eligible to receive from milestone payments, royalties from commercial sales of such drug candidates, assuming relevant approvals from government authorities are obtained, or other payments. Our licenses and intellectual property-related agreements also require it to comply with other obligations including development and diligence obligations, providing certain information regarding our activities with respect to such drug candidates, and/or maintaining the confidentiality of information it receives from our licensors.\nIf we fail to meet any of our material obligations under our license and intellectual property-related agreements, our licensors have the right to terminate their licenses and sublicenses and, upon the effective date of such termination, have the right to re-obtain the licensed and sub-licensed technology and intellectual property. While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to it, including seeking to cure any breaches by it, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the intellectual property rights licensed and sublicensed to it, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost, or at all. In particular, some of the milestone payments are payable upon our drug candidates reaching development milestones and before we have commercialized, or received any revenue from the sales of such drug candidates, and we cannot guarantee that it will have sufficient resources to make such milestone payments. Any uncured material breach under the license agreements could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our rights to the applicable drug candidate. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed or sublicensed prevents or impairs our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected drug candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe depend on our licensors or patent owners of our in-licensed patent rights to prosecute and maintain patents and patent applications that are material to our business. Any failure by our licensors or such patent owners to effectively protect these patent rights could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe have licensed and sublicensed patent rights from third parties for some of our development programs, including abexinostat from Pharmacyclics and XP-102 and XP-105 from Boehringer Ingelheim. As a licensee and sublicensee of third parties, we rely on these third parties to file and prosecute patent applications, maintain patents, and otherwise protect the licensed intellectual property under certain of our license agreements. In addition, we have not had and does not have primary control over these activities for certain of our patents or patent applications and other intellectual property rights that it jointly owns with certain of our licensors and sub-licensors. We cannot be certain that these patents and patent applications have been or will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, or maintained by such third parties in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business, or in a manner that will result in valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property rights that cover our drug candidates. If our licensors or such third parties fail to prepare, prosecute, or maintain such patent applications and patents, or lose rights to those patent applications or patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated, and our rights to develop and commercialize any of our drug candidates that are subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our drug candidates through intellectual property rights, or if the scope of such intellectual property rights obtained is not sufficiently broad, third parties may compete directly against us.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our drug candidates from competition by obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights, including patent rights. We seek to protect the drug candidates and technology that it considers commercially important by filing U.S., PRC, and international patent applications, relying on trade secrets or pharmaceutical regulatory protection or employing a combination of these methods. We also seek to protect our proprietary position by in-licensing intellectual property relating to our technology and drug candidates. We do not own or exclusively license any issued patents with respect to certain of our drug candidates in all territories in which it plans to commercialize our drug candidates. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain or maintain patent protection with respect to our drug candidates and technology it develops, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce, or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. In addition, our license and intellectual property-related agreements may not provide it with exclusive rights to use our in-licensed intellectual property rights relating to the applicable drug candidates in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which it may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and products in the future.\nPatents may be invalidated and patent applications may not be granted for a number of reasons, including known or unknown prior art, deficiencies in the patent application, or the lack of novelty of the underlying invention or technology. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and any other third parties, any of these parties may breach such agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. In addition, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that it or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or in-licensed patents or pending patent applications or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Furthermore, the PRC and, recently, the United States have adopted the \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system under which whoever first files a patent application will be awarded the patent if all other patentability requirements are met. Under the first-to-file system, third parties may be granted a patent relating to a technology, which we invented.\nIn addition, under the PRC Patent Law, any organization or individual that applies for a patent in a foreign country for an invention or utility model accomplished in China is required to report to the State Intellectual Property Office, or \u201cSIPO,\u201d for confidentiality examination. Otherwise, if an application is later filed in China, the patent right will not be granted. Moreover, even if a patent is granted from any of the applications, the grant of a patent is not conclusive as to our scope, validity, or enforceability.\nThe coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and our scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications we currently, or in the future, license or own are issued as patents, they may not be issued in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with it, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. In addition, the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to our inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the PRC, United States, and abroad. We and our licensors may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or \u201cUSPTO,\u201d or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, re-examination, post-grant and inter parties review, or interference proceedings or similar proceedings in foreign jurisdictions challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding, or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our owned or in-licensed patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or drug candidates and compete directly with us without payments to it, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drug candidates without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating third-party patent rights. Moreover, Xynomic, or one of our licensors, may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge the priority of our or our licensor\u2019s invention or other features of patentability of our owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent rights, the loss of exclusivity, or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drug candidates. Such proceedings also may result in substantial costs and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to it. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our technologies or drug candidates will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Xynomic\u2019s competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our owned or in-licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nFurthermore, the terms of patents are finite. The patents we own or in-license and the patents that may issue from our currently pending owned and in-licensed patent applications generally have a 20-year protection period starting from the earliest filing date of such patents and patent applications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such drug candidates might expire before or shortly after such drug candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications may not provide it with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to those of Xynomic. Moreover, some of our patents and patent applications are, and may in the future be, co-owned with third parties. If it is unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners\u2019 interest in such patents or patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co-owners of our patents in order to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to Xynomic. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, maintaining, and defending patents on drug candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States or PRC or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in or into the United States, the PRC, or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where it has not obtained patent protection to develop their own competing products and, in addition, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection or licenses but the enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, including China. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that it initiates, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that it develops or licenses.\nFurthermore, many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nIf our drug candidates infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, we may incur substantial liabilities, and it may not be able to sell or commercialize these drug candidates.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to develop, manufacture, market, and sell our drug candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. In the PRC and the United States, invention patent applications are generally maintained in confidence until their publication, which typically is 18 months after the filing date. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and invention patent applications were filed. Even after reasonable investigation, we may not know with certainty whether any third party may have filed a patent application without our knowledge while it is still developing or producing that product. We may become a party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technologies and any drug candidates it may develop, including interference proceedings, post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings before the USPTO and similar proceedings in foreign jurisdictions.\nThird parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. Even if we believe third-party intellectual property claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability, or priority. A court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable, and infringed, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to commercialize any drug candidates it may develop and any other drug candidates or technologies covered by the asserted third-party patents. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. There is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s patent rights, and is unsuccessful in demonstrating that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, we could be required to:\n\u25cf obtain royalty-bearing licenses from such third party to such patents, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and even if we were able to obtain such licenses, they could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to Xynomic, and could require it to make substantial licensing and royalty payments;\n\u25cf defend litigation or administrative proceedings;\n\u25cf reformulate product(s) so that it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may not be possible or could be very expensive and time consuming;\n\u25cf cease developing, manufacturing, and commercializing the infringing technology or drug candidates; and\n\u25cf pay such third party significant monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right.\nClaims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Even if we are successful in such litigation or administrative proceedings, such litigation and proceedings may be costly and could result in a substantial diversion of management resources. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIntellectual property litigation and proceedings could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to us, our licensor\u2019s or other third parties\u2019 intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than Xynomic can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary intellectual property rights to drug candidates for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nAlthough we also intend to develop drug candidates through our own internal research, our near-term business model is predicated, in large part, on our ability to successfully identify and acquire or in-license drug candidates to grow our drug candidate pipeline. However, we may be unable to acquire or in-license intellectual property rights relating to, or necessary for, any such drug candidates from third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, because we are focusing on specific areas of care such as oncology and inflammatory and infectious diseases. In that event, it may be unable to develop or commercialize such drug candidates. We may also be unable to identify drug candidates that we believe are an appropriate strategic fit for our company and intellectual property relating to, or necessary for, such drug candidates. Any of the foregoing could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe in-licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights for drug candidates is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to in-license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights for drug candidates that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to it. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable drug candidates, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects for growth could suffer.\nIn addition, we expect that competition for the in-licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights for drug candidates that are attractive to it may increase in the future, which may mean fewer suitable opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition or licensing costs. We may be unable to in-license or acquire the third-party intellectual property rights for drug candidates on terms that would allow it to make an appropriate return on our investment.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on the appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nBased on our current indebtedness, financial condition and operating requirements, we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our shares. Any future dividend payments are within the absolute discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions with respect to payment of dividends, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of these controls could also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial frauds. Rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We may encounter problems or delays in completing activities necessary to make an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot assess our internal control over financial reporting as effective, investor confidence and share value may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting, or disclosure of our public accounting firm\u2019s attestation to or report on management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations that affect public companies, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with Section 404(b) and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as Section 14 rules implemented by the SEC. In addition, our management team will also have to adapt to the requirements of being a public company. We expect that compliance with these rules and regulations will substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe increased costs associated with operating as a public company will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. Additionally, if these requirements divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nThere is uncertainty regarding Xynomic\u2019s ability to continue in business as disclosed in its financial statements which includes a statement describing its going concern status. Xynomic\u2019s financial status creates a doubt whether Xynomic will continue as a going concern.\nXynomic has prepared its financial statements assuming that it will continue as a going concern, however, there is substantial doubt Xynomic can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. Xynomic\u2019s independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for Xymomic with an explanatory paragraph describing an uncertainty about Xynomic\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty regarding Xynomic\u2019s ability to continue in business. As such Xymomic may have to cease operations and investors could lose part or all of their investment in Xynomic\u2019s business.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for holders of our common stock.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchased it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf the success of competitive drugs;\n\u25cf results of clinical trials of our drug candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents, or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the level of expenses related to any of our drug candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u25cf the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire, or in-license additional drug candidates or drugs;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines, or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25cf general economic, industry, and market conditions; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants (excluding any placement warrants held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees) at any time prior to their expiration, at $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third business day prior to the date we send proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you: (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its warrant (including any warrants held by our sponsor, officers, directors or their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and any trading volume could decline.\nAny trading market for our Common Stock that may develop will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us or our business. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading prices for our Common Stock could be negatively affected. If securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, and one or more of those analysts downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Common Stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and any trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plan or otherwise, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that we will need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell Common Stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell Common Stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, including issuance of equity securities pursuant to any future stock incentive plan to our officers, directors, employees and non-employee consultants for their services to us, investors in a prior transaction may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Additionally, any such sales may result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock. Further, any future sales of our Common Stock by us or resales of our Common Stock by our existing stockholders could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. Any future grants of options, warrants or other securities exercisable or convertible into our Common Stock, or the exercise or conversion of such shares, and any sales of such shares in the market, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe indemnify our directors and officers against certain liabilities and do not presently carry director and officer liability insurance.\nAs permitted under Delaware law and pursuant to our governing documents and indemnification agreements with certain of our officers and directors, we indemnify our directors and officers against monetary damages, including advancing expenses, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware law. We do not carry director and officer liability insurance, so our assets are at risk in the event of successful claims against us or our officers and directors. Our assets may not be sufficient to satisfy judgments against us and our officers and directors in the event of such successful claims. In addition, our lack of director and officer liability insurance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified directors and officers in the future.\nOur Common Stock may be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which may make it more difficult for stockholders to sell our Common Stock.\nThe SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person, and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination, and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of the Company\u2019s Common Stock if and when such shares are eligible for sale and may cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\nOur executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their affiliates continue to exercise significant influence over our company, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nOur executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their affiliates will beneficially hold in aggregate 86.26% of the outstanding voting power. These insiders are able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could delay or prevent an outside party from acquiring or merging with us even if our other stockholders wanted it to occur.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nWe are currently governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which limits the ability of shareholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for shareholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some shareholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nXynomic stockholders have agreed to lock up their Merger Consideration Shares until February 15, 2020 (subject to certain exceptions) and our Sponsor and each of our current officers and current directors and an advisor, in each case, that hold Founder Shares (as defined below) who we refer to as our \u201cInitial Shareholders\u201d have agreed to lock up 50% of the 1,509,375 shares of Bison ordinary shares issued to our Sponsor and James Jiayuan Tong in a private placement prior to our initial public offering which we refer to as the \u201cFounder Shares\u201d until the earlier of (a) May 15, 2020, or (b) the date on which the closing price of the Company common shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period and lock up the remaining 50% of the Founder Shares until May 15, 2020. If our Initial Shareholders or Xynomic stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after all legal restrictions on resale lapse, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThere is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money, and they may expire worthless and the terms of our warrants may be amended.\nThe exercise price for our warrants is $11.50 per whole share, subject to certain adjustment. Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of Company common shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. There is no guarantee that the public warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration and they may expire worthless.\nIn addition, the warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as the warrant agent, and us provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Company common shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nThere may not be sufficient liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their securities and the market price of our Common Stock may be volatile.\nThere is currently only a limited public market for our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that a trading market will develop further or be maintained in the future. The market price of our Common Stock has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile, as is the stock market in general. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our Common Stock are beyond our control, such as changes in financial estimates by industry and securities analysts, conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our Common Stock. Additionally, on May 15, 2019, we received written notice from the staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that the Staff had determined to delist the Company\u2019s securities from Nasdaq based upon the Company\u2019s non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5505(a)(3) and 5515(a)(4). On July 15, 2019, the Hearings Panel at Nasdaq (the \u201cPanel\u201d) denied our request for continued listing on Nasdaq based upon the Company\u2019s non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5505(a)(3), 5515(a)(4), and 5505(b)(1)(A). As a result, on July 17, 2019, our Common Stock was delisted from Nasdaq Stock Market and is currently trading on the OTC Pink. Our stock experienced significant pressure after these events.\nThese factors and the events listed above may materially adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our performance. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may consider continuing our compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements and to remedy our noncompliance with Nasdaq\u2019s initial listing requirement. To that extent, we also note that on May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC mainly impacting companies with businesses principally administered in jurisdictions newly-defined as \u201cRestrictive Markets.\u201d The three new Nasdaq proposals that would apply to \u201cRestrictive Market\u201d companies are (1) to adopt a new requirement related to the qualifications of management; (2) to apply additional initial listing criteria related to offering size and liquidity; and (3) to apply more stringent criteria based on the qualifications of the company\u2019s auditor. Based on the new definition of \u201cRestricted Market\u201d in Rule 5005(a)(37) as proposed by Nasdaq, China may be considered as a restricted market. As partial of our operations, principal executive offices, certain senior management and employees as well as certain books and records are located or maintained in China, we may be considered as a company with business principally administered in a \u201cRestrictive Market\u201d. As a result, if such proposals become effective, we will face additional listing criteria if we continue our listing application with Nasdaq. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in listing our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAmong which, one is to apply additional initial listing criteria for companies primarily operating in \u201cRestricted Market\u201d.\nPursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following June 23, 2022, the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (c) our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period exceeds $1 billion, or (d) if the market value of our shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen not to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Such circumstances could adversely affect the value and liquidity of our securities.\nThe future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have entered into registration rights agreement with majority shareholders of the Company which grants holders of our Founder Shares, Private Units, Working Capital Units (as hereinafter defined), Backstop Shares and the Merger Consideration Shares respective demand registration rights and piggy back registration rights. We also granted investors in the Private Unit Offering certain demand and piggy-back registration rights. The future exercise of these registration rights may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWarrants will become exercisable for our Company common shares, which would increase the number of Company common shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe currently have 3,259,779 warrants issued and outstanding, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of our Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustments. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. To the extent warrants are exercised, additional shares will be issued, which will result in dilution to the then existing holders of Company common shares and increase the number of Company common shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe foreign subsidiaries of the combined entity may qualify as a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d), which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to the combined entity.\nUnder the CFC rules, a 10% Shareholder generally must include annually as ordinary income its pro rata share of its CFC\u2019s \u201csubpart F income\u201d and \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income,\u201d even if no distributions are made by the foreign subsidiaries to the combined entity. Therefore, the combined entity must generally include annually as ordinary income its foreign subsidiaries\u2019 \u201csubpart F income\u201d and \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income,\u201d even if no distributions are made by the foreign subsidiaries to the combined entity, causing adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to the combined entity. We urge U.S. investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the CFC rules.\nWe may have been, and may become, subject to income tax (or an increased amount of income tax) in one or more countries, including the United States, which could materially reduce our after-tax returns and the value of Company common shares.\nAll or a portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries may be treated in the United States as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Whether our foreign subsidiaries have been, or will be, subject to tax in the United States is not free from doubt in light of the applicable tax law and guidance regarding activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you that the IRS will not contend, perhaps successfully, that our foreign subsidiary is engaged in a trade or business in the United States or is subject to more U.S. income tax than it currently incurs. A foreign corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as branch profits tax, on its income that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under an applicable tax treaty.\nWe could become subject to income tax in one or more countries, including the United States, as a result of activities performed by it, adverse developments or changes in law, contrary conclusions by the relevant tax authorities or other causes. The imposition of any of these income taxes could materially reduce the combined company\u2019s post-tax returns available for distributions on, and consequently the value of, Company common shares.\nAn investor may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences in the event the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) were to disagree with the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein.\nWe have not sought a ruling from the IRS as to any U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. The IRS may disagree with the descriptions of U.S. federal income tax consequences contained herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Any such determination could subject an investor or our company to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences that would be different than those described herein. Accordingly, each prospective investor is urged to consult a tax advisor with respect to the specific tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares, rights, and warrants, including the applicability and effect of state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws, as well as U.S. federal tax laws.", "PERMNO": 16815, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "XYNO"}
