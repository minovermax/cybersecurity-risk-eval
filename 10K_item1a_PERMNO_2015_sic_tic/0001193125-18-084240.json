{"cik": "95552", "company": "SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements, which may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d)\u201d and Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nOur business routinely encounters and addresses risks and uncertainties. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. Discussion about the important operational risks that our business encounters can also be found in the MD&A section and in the business description in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report. Below, we have described our present view of the most significant risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently do not consider significant, could also potentially impair our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our reactions to these risks and uncertainties as well as our competitors\u2019 reactions will affect our future operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nEfforts to integrate our Europe segment, including substantial integration expenses and the additional indebtedness incurred to finance our acquisition of Uniwheels, could disrupt our business and adversely impact our stock price and future business and results of operations.\nSince the acquisition of Uniwheels (now referred to as our \u201cEurope segment,\u201d \u201cEurope business\u201d or \u201cEurope operations\u201d) on May 30, 2017 (the \u201cAcquisition\u201d), we have made significant strides toward integrating the two companies. However, the continuing integration of our Europe segment with our North America segment will be a complex and time-consuming process that may not be successful. The company has a limited history of integrating a significant acquisition into its business and the integration process may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The primary areas of focus for successfully combining our Europe segment with our North American operations may include, among others: retaining and integrating management and other key employees; realizing overall improvement in the design, engineering, start-up and production of wheel programs; aligning customer interface across the combined business; integrating information, communications and other systems; and managing the growth of the combined company. Our integration efforts could disrupt our business in the following ways, among others, and any of the following could adversely affect our business, harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects:\n\u2022\nthe attention of management may be directed toward the completion of the integration and other transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of Superior, and matters related to the Acquisition may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nour employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles in the combined company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel; and\n\u2022\ncustomers, suppliers and other third parties with business relationships with Superior may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with Superior as a result of the Acquisition, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with Superior or otherwise.\nThere are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated with the rest of our operations, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll, manufacturing, marketing and employee benefits. While we expect to incur integration and restructuring costs and other transaction-related costs following completion of the Acquisition that currently are estimated to range between $5.0 million and $7.0 million, many of the expenses that will be incurred, especially with respect to manufacturing operations are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction, Acquisition-related and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nEven if we successfully integrate our Europe segment with our North American operations, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits. The Acquisition is expected to result in various benefits for the combined company including, among others, business growth opportunities and synergies in operations, purchasing and administration. Increased competition and/or deterioration in business conditions may limit our ability to expand this business. As such, we may not be able to realize the synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the Acquisition.\nThe automotive industry is cyclical and volatility in the automotive industry could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe majority of our sales are made in European and domestic U.S. markets. Therefore, our financial performance depends largely on conditions in the European and U.S. automotive industry, which in turn can be affected significantly by broad economic and financial market conditions. Consumer demand for automobiles is subject to considerable volatility as a result of consumer confidence in general economic conditions, levels of employment, prevailing wages, fuel prices and the availability and cost of consumer credit. There can be no guarantee that the improvements in recent years will be sustained or that reductions from current production levels will not occur in future periods. Demand for aluminum wheels can be further affected by other factors, including pricing and performance comparisons to competitive materials such as steel. Finally, the demand for our products is influenced by shifts of market share between vehicle manufacturers and the specific market penetration of individual vehicle platforms being sold by our customers.\nA limited number of customers represent a large percentage of our sales. The loss of a significant customer or decrease in demand could adversely affect our operating results.\nFord, GM and Toyota, together, represented 82 percent of our sales in 2016 and just more than half of our total consolidated combined sales in 2017. Despite the decrease in the combined percentage of our three largest customers in 2017, a loss of a significant customer or decrease in demand still remains a risk. Our OEM customers are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. Increasingly global procurement practices, the pace of new vehicle introduction and demand for price reductions may make it more difficult to maintain long-term supply arrangements with our customers, and there are no guarantees that we will be able to negotiate supply arrangements with our customers on terms acceptable to us in the future. The contracts we have entered into with most of our customers provide that we will manufacture wheels for a particular vehicle model, rather than manufacture a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one\nyear to the life of the model (usually three to five years), typically are non-exclusive and do not require the purchase by the customer of any minimum number of wheels from us. Therefore, a significant decrease in consumer demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers, or a decision by a manufacturer not to purchase from us, or to discontinue purchasing from us, for a particular model or group of models, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe automotive component supply industry is highly competitive, both domestically and internationally. Competition is based on a number of factors, including price, technology, quality, delivery and overall customer service and available capacity to meet customer demands. Some of our competitors are companies, or divisions or subsidiaries of companies, which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. We cannot ensure that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these competitors. In particular, our ability to increase manufacturing capacity typically requires significant investments in facilities, equipment and personnel. Our operating facilities are at full or near to full capacity levels which may cause us to incur labor costs at premium rates in order to meet customer requirements, experience increased maintenance expenses or require us to replace our machinery and equipment on an accelerated basis. Furthermore, the nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted new entrants, particularly from low cost countries. As a result, our sales levels and margins continue to be adversely affected by pricing pressures reflective of significant competition from producers located in low-cost foreign markets, such as China. Such competition with lower cost structures poses a significant threat to our ability to compete internationally and domestically. These factors have led to our customers awarding business to foreign competitors in the past, and they may continue to do so in the future. In addition, any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately, develop products that are superior to our products, have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Consequently, our products may not be able to compete successfully with competitors\u2019 products.\nWe experience continual pressure to reduce costs.\nThe vehicle market is highly competitive at the OEM level, which drives continual cost-cutting initiatives by our customers. Customer concentration, relative supplier fragmentation and product commoditization have translated into continual pressure from OEMs to reduce the price of our products. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as OEMs pursue restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margin, rate of profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in OEMs\u2019 purchasing policies or payment practices could have an adverse effect on our business. Our OEM customers typically attempt to qualify more than one wheel supplier for the programs we participate in and for programs we may bid on in the future. As such, our OEM customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing or may decrease wheel orders. Such actions may result in decreased sales volumes and unit price reductions for our company, resulting in lower revenues, gross profit, operating income and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement cost-saving measures or achieve expected benefits under our plans to improve operations.\nAs part of our ongoing focus to provide high quality products, we continually analyze our business to further improve our operations and identify cost-cutting measures. We may be unable to successfully identify or implement plans targeting these initiatives, or fail to realize the benefits of the plans we have already implemented, as a result of operational difficulties, a weakening of the economy or other factors. Cost reductions may not fully offset decreases in the prices of our products due to the time required to develop and implement cost reduction initiatives. Additional factors such as inconsistent customer ordering patterns, increasing product complexity and heightened quality standards are making it increasingly more difficult to reduce our costs. It is possible that as we incur costs to implement improvement strategies, the impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow may be negative.\nInterruption in our production capabilities could result in increased freight costs or contract cancellations.\nIn the last six months of 2016, we experienced significant operating inefficiencies primarily in one of our manufacturing facilities. The inefficiencies stemmed from a variety of issues that reduced production rates. Contributing factors to the inefficiencies included an electricity outage and unanticipated equipment reliability issues which reduced finished goods and work-in-process inventories. We also experienced several new product launches and significant ramp-up in demand for newer products for which unusually high scrap rates were occurring. Lower than normal production yields coupled with the loss of inventory safety stock resulted in a series of expedited shipments to customers. The higher than normal costs included approximately $13 million in freight expediting costs and additional costs related to the production inefficiencies. In 2017, we were able to reduce the expedited shipping costs to less than $1 million and have made strides toward improving the production inefficiencies at this plant. However, headcount at this plant remained at elevated levels in 2017 to ensure we could meet new product launches, better serve our customers and avoid expedited shipping charges.\nAn interruption in production capabilities at any of our facilities as a result of equipment failure, interruption of raw materials or other supplies, labor disputes or other reasons could result in our inability to produce our products, which would reduce our sales and operating results for the affected period and harm our customer relationships. We have, from time to time, undertaken significant re-tooling and modernization initiatives at our facilities, which in the past have caused, and in the future may cause, unexpected delays and plant underutilization, and such adverse consequences may continue to occur as we continue to modernize our production facilities. In addition, we generally deliver our products only after receiving the order from the customer and thus typically do not hold large inventories. In the event of a production interruption at any of our manufacturing facilities, even if only temporary, or if we experience delays as a result of events that are beyond our control, delivery times to our customers could be severely affected. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to premium freight costs and other performance penalties, as well as contract cancellations, and cause us to lose future sales and expose us to other claims for damages. Our manufacturing facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions or violent weather conditions. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nSimilarly, it also is possible that our customers may experience production delays or disruptions for a variety of reasons, which could include supply-chain disruption for parts other than wheels, equipment breakdowns or other events affecting vehicle assembly rates that impact us, work stoppages or slow-downs at factories where our products are consumed, or even catastrophic events such as fires, disruptive weather conditions or natural disasters. Such disruptions at the customer level may cause the affected customer to halt or limit the purchase of our products.\nWe may be unable to successfully launch new products and/or achieve technological advances.\nIn order to effectively compete in the automotive supply industry, we must be able to launch new products and adopt technology to meet our customers\u2019 demands in a timely manner. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed for new product programs in time for the start of production, or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. In addition, we cannot ensure that our customers will execute the launch of their new product programs on schedule. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly. Further, changes in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. Our failure to successfully and timely launch new products or adopt new technologies, or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs, could adversely affect our results. We cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or that certain of our products will not become obsolete.\nOur international operations and international trade agreements make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe manufacture a substantial portion of our products in Mexico, Germany and Poland and we sell our products internationally. Accordingly, unfavorable changes in foreign cost structures, trade protection laws, tariffs on aluminum, regulations and policies affecting trade and investments and social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region, among other factors, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies.\nChanges in North American and European Union (EU) social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the countries where we currently develop and sell products could adversely affect our business. A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in Mexico. Current leadership in the U.S. federal government is not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). If the U.S. withdraws from or materially modifies NAFTA or certain other international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, proposals to institute a border adjustment of 20 percent for imports could have a negative impact on our operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currencies may adversely impact our financial condition.\nDue to the growth of our operations outside of the United States, we have experienced increased exposure to foreign currency gains and losses in the ordinary course of our business. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar, the Mexican peso, the Euro, the Polish Zloty and any currencies of other countries in which we conduct our business may have a material impact on our financial condition, as cash flows generated in foreign currencies may be used, in part, to service our U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities, or vice versa.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the value of our foreign assets as reported in U.S. dollars, and may adversely affect reported earnings and, accordingly, the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same market. In addition, changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. We cannot ensure that fluctuations in exchange rates will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations.\nOur business requires us to settle transactions between currencies in both directions - i.e., peso to U.S. dollar, Euro to U.S. Dollar, Euro to Zloty and vice versa for all transactions. To the greatest extent possible, we attempt to match the timing and magnitude of transaction settlements between currencies to create a \u201cnatural hedge.\u201d Based on the current business model and levels of production and sales activity, the net imbalance between currencies depends on specific circumstances. While changes in the terms of the contracts with our customers will be creating an imbalance between currencies that we are hedging with foreign currency forward contracts, there can be no assurances that our hedging program will effectively offset the impact of the imbalance between currencies or that the net transaction balance will not change significantly in the future.\nTo manage this risk, we may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions and forecasted future cash flows. We have a program to hedge a portion of our material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 42 months. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There is no guarantee that our hedge program will effectively mitigate our exposures to foreign exchange changes which could have material adverse effects on our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition\nWe have a significant amount of new indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, our total debt was $707.9 million ($683.6 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $24.3 million), and we had availability of $157.2 million under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as well as 30.0 million Euros under a European revolving line of credit. The interest expense on the significant amount of new indebtedness will be significantly higher than historical interest expense and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nSubject to the limits contained in the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.\nIn addition, the Indenture and the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, economic and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and our other indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations and limit our financial flexibility. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture will restrict our ability to conduct asset sales and/or use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate these asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair and any proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. For more information on the Indenture, see Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture will, and the documents governing other debt that we may incur in the future may, restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe Indenture and the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the documents governing other debt that we may incur in the future may, contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose\nsignificant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments, acquisitions, loans or advances or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase our capital stock or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase any subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements which limit the ability of our non-guarantor subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests to the extent subject to certain financial covenant conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. We may not meet those ratios and tests.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Indenture governing the Notes or under the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors under such facility to accelerate the related debt, which may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In the event our lenders or holders of the Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms acceptable to us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions, along with restrictions that may be contained in agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness, may affect our ability to grow or pursue other important initiatives in accordance with our growth.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available\nfor servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $386.8 million of our debt was variable rate debt. Our anticipated annual interest expense on $386.8 million variable rate debt at the current rate of 6.05 percent would be $23.4 million. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly subjective. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform\u201d) was signed into law. The newly enacted Tax Reform, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, a one-time transition tax on offshore earnings at reduced tax rates regardless of whether earnings are repatriated, the elimination of U.S. tax on foreign dividends (subject to certain important exceptions), new taxes on certain foreign earnings, a new minimum tax related to payments to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, immediate deductions for certain new investments and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nThe changes effected by the Tax Reform required us to remeasure existing net deferred tax liabilities using the lower rate in the period of enactment. We have reported provisional amounts for the income tax effects of Tax Reform for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined. Based on a continued analysis of the estimates and further guidance on the application of the law, it is anticipated that additional revisions may occur throughout the allowable measurement period.\nIn addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. The impact of tax reform in the US or other foreign tax law changes could result in an overall tax rate increase to our business.\nIncreases in the costs and restrictions on availability of raw materials could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow.\nGenerally, we obtain our raw materials, supplies and energy requirements from various sources. Although we currently maintain alternative sources, our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Fluctuations in the prices of raw materials may be driven by the supply/demand relationship for that commodity or governmental regulation. In addition, if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated, the availability or price of raw materials could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we are able to periodically pass certain aluminum cost increases on to our customers, we may not be able to pass along all changes in aluminum costs, or there may be a delay in passing the aluminum costs onto our\ncustomers. Our customers are not obligated to accept energy or other supply cost increases that we may attempt to pass along to them. This inability to pass on these cost increases to our customers could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow, possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability.\nAluminum and alloy pricing may have a material effect on our operating margins and results of operations.\nThe cost of aluminum is a significant component in the overall cost of a wheel and in our selling prices to OEM customers. The price for aluminum we purchase is adjusted monthly based primarily on changes in certain published market indices, but the timing of such adjustments is based on specific customer agreements and can vary from monthly to quarterly. As a result, the timing of aluminum price adjustments flowing through sales rarely will match the timing of such changes in cost and can result in fluctuations to our gross profit. This is especially true during periods of frequent increases or decreases in the market price of aluminum.\nThe aluminum we use to manufacture wheels also contains additional alloy materials, including silicon. The cost of alloying materials also is a component of the overall cost of a wheel. The price of the alloys we purchase is also based on certain published market indices; however, most of our customer agreements do not provide price adjustments for changes in market prices of alloying materials. Increases or decreases in the market prices of these alloying materials could have a material effect on our operating margins and results of operations.\nThere is a risk of discontinuation of anti-dumping duty from China which may increase the competitive pressure from Chinese producers, primarily in the aftermarket.\nIn 2010, the European Commission imposed provisional anti-dumping duties of 22.3 percent on imports of aluminum road wheels from China after a complaint of unfair competition from European manufacturers. The European Commission argued that the EU manufacturers had suffered a significant decrease in production and sales, and a loss of market share, as well as price depression due to cheaper imports from China. On January 23, 2017, the European Commission decided to maintain the anti-dumping duties (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/109) for another five year period. The anti-dumping duties protect the EU producers until January 24, 2022. After this date, the competitive pressures from Chinese producers, which have cost advantages, primarily in the aftermarket, may adversely affect the company\u2019s assets, financial condition and results of operations or prospects.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws.\nWe incur costs to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot ensure that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. Failure to be in compliance with such laws and regulations could result in material fines or sanctions. Additionally, changes to such laws or regulations may have a significant impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the storage, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes and the health and safety of our employees. The nature of our current and former operations and the history of industrial uses at some of our facilities expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental and worker health and safety matters which could have a material adverse effect on our financial health. In addition, some of our properties are subject to indemnification and/or cleanup obligations of third parties with respect to environmental matters. However, in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of such third parties, we could be required to bear the liabilities that would otherwise be the responsibility of such third parties.\nFurther, changes in legislation or regulation imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, or otherwise impacting or limiting our equipment and operations or from the vehicles that use our products could adversely affect demand for those vehicles or require us to incur costs to become compliant with such regulations.\nWe are from time to time subject to litigation, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation in the ordinary course of our business. We are exposed to potential product liability and warranty risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of automotive products, the failure of which could result in property damage, personal injury or death. Accordingly, individual or class action suits alleging product liability or warranty claims could result. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in any product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot give assurance that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business involves extensive product development activities leading to the creation of new products. In the case of new products, there is a risk that wheels under development may not be ready by the start of production (\u201cSOP\u201d) and/or may fail to meet the customer\u2019s specifications. In any such case, warranty or compensation claims might be raised, or litigation might be commenced, against the company. Moreover, the company could lose its reputation of an entrepreneur actively developing new and innovative solutions, which in turn could affect the volume of orders, particularly orders for new designs.\nMoreover, there are risks related to civil liability under supply contracts (civil liability clauses in contracts with customers, contractual risks related to civil liability for causing delay in production launch, etc.). If we fail to ensure production launch as and when required by the customer, thus jeopardizing production processes at the customer\u2019s facilities, this could lead to increased costs, giving rise to recourse claims against, or causing loss of orders by the company. This could also have an adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully. In addition, key personnel may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management team. We may be unsuccessful in replacing key managers who either resign or retire. The loss of any member of our senior management team or other experienced senior employees could impair our ability to execute our business plans and strategic initiatives, cause us to lose customers and experience reduced net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees. In any such event, our financial condition, results of operations, internal control over financial reporting or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, in order to remain competitive and retain our Europe segment employees, the company may be forced to increase its labor costs at a faster pace than it historically has done. Labor costs represent a considerable part of the cost of our Europe segment\u2019s products. Though the workforce currently costs less in Poland than in other EU member states, the difference should decrease over time as the Polish economy is catching up with the average of the EU.\nIf the company fails to attract an adequate number of qualified employees and to retain such employees at salaries prevailing in the industry and increase labor efficiency and effectiveness (particularly with respect to our Europe segment\u2019s manufacturing and production in Poland and Germany), this may have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s assets, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe may be unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Many of our key controls rely on maintaining personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the application of U.S. GAAP in order to operate effectively. Material weaknesses or deficiencies may cause our financial statements to contain material misstatements, unintentional errors or omissions and late filings with regulatory agencies may occur. As part of the integration, we will be aligning the control framework in 2018 to ensure our Europe segment has adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). If the Europe segment is unable to implement the control framework in 2018, we will not have adequate control over financial reporting for the consolidated company.\nA disruption in our information technology systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems, as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other service providers could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. These types of incidents have become more prevalent and pervasive across industries, including in our industry, and are expected to continue in the future. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our information technology systems from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, our activities and investment may not be deployed quickly enough or successfully protect our systems against all vulnerabilities, including technologies developed to bypass our security measures. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose access credentials or other sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks. There are no assurances that our actions and investments to improve the maturity of our systems, processes and risk management framework or remediate vulnerabilities will be sufficient or completed quickly enough to prevent or limit the impact of any cyber intrusion. Moreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are also dependent on security measures that some of our third-party customers, suppliers and other service providers take to protect their own systems and infrastructures. Some of these third parties store or have access to certain of our sensitive data, as well as confidential information about their own operations, and as such are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. Any security breach of any of these third-parties\u2019 systems could result in unauthorized access to our information technology systems, cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nCompetitors could copy our products or technologies and we could violate protected intellectual property rights or trade secrets of our competitors or other third parties.\nWe register business-related intellectual property rights, such as industrial designs and trademarks, hold licenses and other agreements covering the use of intellectual property rights, and have taken steps to ensure that our\ntrade secrets and technological know-how remain confidential. Nevertheless, there is a risk that third parties would attempt to copy, in full or in part, our products, technologies or industrial designs, or to obtain unauthorized access and use of company secrets, technological know-how or other protected intellectual property rights. Also, other companies could successfully develop technologies, products or industrial designs similar to, and thus potentially compete with, us.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that we will not unknowingly infringe intellectual property rights of our competitors, such as patents and industrial designs, especially due to the fact that the interpretations of what constitutes protected intellectual property may differ. Similarly, there is a risk that we will illegitimately use intellectual property developed by our employees, which is subject in each case to relevant regulations governing employee-created innovations. If a dispute concerning intellectual property rights arises, in which the relevant court issues an opinion on the disputed intellectual property rights contrary to us, identifying a breach of intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages or to stop the use of such intellectual property. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of injunctions being imposed to prevent further infringement, leading to a decrease in the number of orders.\nAll these events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe may be unable to successfully achieve expected benefits from our joint ventures or acquisitions.\nAs we continue to expand globally, we have engaged, and may continue to engage, in joint ventures and we may pursue acquisitions that involve potential risks, including failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such joint ventures or acquisitions. Integrating acquired operations is a significant challenge, and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integrations successfully. Failure to successfully integrate operations or to realize the expected benefits of such joint ventures or acquisitions may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.\nOur consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our consolidated financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position.\nWe may fail to comply with conditions of the state tax incentive programs in Poland.\nWe have three production plants in a special Poland economic zone, Tanobrzeska Specjalna Strefa Ekonomiczna Euro-Park Wislosan in Stalowa Wola, Poland. Our Polish operations were granted seven permits to operate in such special economic zone, which allows us to benefit from Polish state tax incentives. The permits require certain conditions to be met, which include increasing the number of employees, keeping the number of employees at such level and incurring required capital expenditures. In addition, particular permits indicate deadlines for completion of respective stages of investments. For three of the seven permits, conditions have\nalready been fulfilled. As of December 31, 2017, the tax subsidies are limited to 2017 (for three permits) and 2026 (for four permits). If we do not fulfill the conditions required by the permits, the permits might be withdrawn and we would no longer benefit from state tax incentives, which may impact our assets, financial condition, results of operations or prospects in a material way. Furthermore, under current Polish regulations, special economic zones are scheduled to cease to exist in 2026.\nWe are currently unable to fully deduct interest charges on German indebtedness.\nThe interest deduction barrier (Zinsschranke) limits the tax deductibility of interest expenses for a German business. If no exception to the interest deduction barrier applies, the net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) is deductible up to 30 percent of the taxable EBITDA (verrechenbares EBITDA) taxable in Germany in a given financial year. Non-deductible interest expenses can be carried forward. Interest carry-forwards are subject to the same tax cancellation rules as tax loss carry-forwards. Whenever interest expenses are not deductible or if an interest carry-forward is lost, the tax burden in future assessment periods could rise, which might have alone, or in combination, a material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operation or prospects.\nWe may be exposed to risks related to existing and future profit and loss transfer agreements executed with German subsidiaries of Uniwheels.\nProfit and loss transfer agreements are one of the prerequisites of the taxation of Superior and its German subsidiaries as a German tax group. For tax purposes, a profit and loss transfer agreement must have a contract term for a minimum of five years. In addition, such agreement must be fully executed. If a profit and loss transfer agreement or its actual execution does not meet the prerequisites for the taxation as a German tax group, Superior Industries International AG (SII AG) and each subsidiary are taxed on their own income (and under certain circumstances even with retrospective effect). Additionally, 5 percent of dividends from the subsidiary to SII AG would be regarded as non-deductible expenses at the SII AG level. Furthermore, the compensation of a loss of a subsidiary would be regarded as contribution by SII AG into the subsidiary and thus, would not directly reduce SII AG\u2019s profits. As a consequence, if the profit and loss transfer agreements do not meet the prerequisites of a German tax group, this could have a future material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe may not have the ability to use cash to settle the principal amount of the Notes upon redemption or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe Notes are redeemable any time on or after June 15, 2020 at a redemption price set forth in the Indenture. In addition, the company may redeem some or all of the Notes prior to June 15, 2020 at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount thereof plus a \u201cmake-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. Prior to June 15, 2020, the company may redeem up to 40 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes using the proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture. If the company experiences a change of control or sells certain assets, the company may be required to offer to purchase the Notes from holders. If we do not have adequate cash available or cannot obtain additional financing, or our use of cash is restricted by applicable law, regulations or agreements governing our current or future indebtedness, we may not be able to repurchase the Notes when required under the Indenture, which would constitute an event of default under the Indenture. An event of default under the Indenture could also lead to a default under other agreements governing our current and future indebtedness, and if the repayment of such other indebtedness were accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversion of the Notes.\nThe terms of the Notes could delay or prevent an attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the Notes require us to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change. A takeover of our company would constitute a fundamental change. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nPurchase of additional shares of Uniwheels could take more time than anticipated and may take more resources and a higher purchase price.\nSuperior executed a Domination and Profit Loss Transfer Agreement, \u201cDPLTA\u201d, which became effective in January 2018. According to the terms of the DPLTA, Superior AG offered to purchase any further tendered shares for cash consideration of Euro 62.18, or approximately Polish Zloty 264 per share. This cash consideration may be subject to change based on appraisal proceedings that the minority shareholders of Uniwheels have initiated.", "PERMNO": 52396, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "SUP"}
