Risk Factors\nThe nature of the business activities conducted by the Company subjects us to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the material risks relating to the Company\u2019s business activities. Other risks are described in \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d Prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings.\nWe face many business risks, including those related to our financial performance, investments in our common stock, operating our business and legal matters. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nBusiness and Operational Risk Factors\n\u2022Our sales cycle may be lengthy, and the timing of sales, along with additional services such as network design, installation and implementation of our products within our customers\u2019 networks, may extend over more than one period, which can make our operating results difficult to predict.\n\u2022We face risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, threatened health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our manufacturing, sales and other operations.\n\u2022We may undertake further restructuring activities, which may adversely impact our operations, and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these activities or any potential future restructurings. Any restructuring activities may harm our business.\n\u2022We must continue to increase our revenues and/or reduce costs if we hope to maintain profitability.\n\u2022Our quarterly results may be volatile, which can adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\u2022Our success will depend on new products introduced to the marketplace in a timely manner, successfully completing product transitioning and achieving customer acceptance.\n\u2022We rely on various third-party service partners to help complement our global operations, and failure to adequately manage these relationships could adversely impact our financial results and relationships with customers.\n\u2022We must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful.\n\u2022Our average sales prices may decline in the future.\n\u2022Credit and commercial risks and exposures could increase if the financial condition of our customers declines.\n\u2022Our restructuring actions could harm our relationships with our employees and impact our ability to recruit new employees.\n\u2022Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.\n\u2022We face strong competition for maintaining and improving our position in the market, which can adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results.\n\u2022Our ability to sell our products and compete successfully is highly dependent on the quality of our customer service and support, and our failure to offer high quality service and support could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\n\u2022Product performance problems, including undetected errors in our hardware or software, or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation.\n\u2022If we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements or customer demand, we could incur additional costs, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u2022If we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships, we could incur additional costs or be unable to timely fulfill our customer commitments, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations and, in the event of an inability to fulfill commitments, would harm our customer relationships.\n\u2022We depend on sole or limited sources and geographies for some key components and failure to receive timely delivery of any of these components could result in deferred or lost sales.\n\u2022Because a significant amount of our revenue may come from a limited number of customers, the termination of any of these customer relationships may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We continually evaluate strategic transaction opportunities which could involve merger, divestiture, sale and/or acquisition activities that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\n\u2022If we fail to develop and maintain distribution and licensing relationships, our revenue may decrease.\nFinancial and Macroeconomic Risk Factors\n\u2022Due to the volume of our international sales, we may be susceptible to a number of political, economic and geographic risks that could harm our business.\n\u2022There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.\n\u2022We may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.\n\u2022The effects of global financial and economic conditions in certain markets have had, and may continue to have, significant effects on our customers and suppliers, and has in the past, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price.\n\u2022Changes in tax laws, treaties, rulings, regulations or agreements, or their interpretation in any country in which we operate; the loss of a major tax dispute; a successful challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries; or other factors could cause volatility in our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other tax benefits may be limited.\n\u2022We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk Factors\n\u2022Continued tension in U.S.-China trade relations may adversely impact our supply chain operations and business.\n\u2022If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may be deprived of legal recourse against those who misappropriate our intellectual property.\n\u2022If sufficient radio frequency spectrum is not allocated for use by our products, or we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products, our ability to market our products may be restricted.\n\u2022Our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and anti-bribery measures which have resulted in increased costs and may continue to result in additional costs or potential liabilities in the future.\n\u2022Our products are used in critical communications networks which may subject us to significant liability claims.\n\u2022We may be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property. This litigation could be costly to defend and resolve and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology.\n\u2022We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws relating to data privacy and security, which are continuously evolving. It may become costly for us to comply with such data privacy laws, and violating any of these data privacy law could cause an adverse effect on our reputation, business, and operations.\n\u2022We are subject to complex federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to protection of the environment that could materially and adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations, as well as those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers.\n\u2022Increased attention to environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters and conservation measures may adversely impact our business.\n\u2022Increased focus on climate change issues has contributed to an evolving state of environmental regulation relating to climate change, and uncertainty related to such regulation, as well as physical risks of climate change, could impact our results of operations, financial or competitive position.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022Natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as terrorism and war could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022System security risks, data protection breaches, and cyber-attacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our security products, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price.\n\u2022We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (\u201cThe Plan\u201d), and provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nBusiness and Operational Risk Factors\nOur sales cycle may be lengthy, and the timing of sales, along with additional services such as network design, installation and implementation of our products within our customers\u2019 networks, may extend over more than one period, which can make our operating results difficult to predict.\nWe experience difficulty in accurately predicting the timing of the sale of products and amounts of revenue generated from sales of our products, primarily in developing countries. The establishment of a business relationship with a potential customer is a lengthy process, usually taking several months or more. Following the establishment of the relationship, the negotiation of purchase terms can be time-consuming, and a potential customer may require an extended evaluation and testing period. Once a purchase agreement has been executed, the timing and amount of revenue, if applicable, may remain difficult to predict. Our typical product sales cycle, which results in our products being designed into our customers\u2019 networks, can take 12 to 24 months. A number of factors contribute to the length of the sales cycle, including technical evaluations of our products and the design process required to integrate our products into our customers\u2019 networks. The completion of services such as installation and testing of the customer\u2019s networks and the completion of all other suppliers\u2019 network elements are subject to the customer\u2019s timing and efforts and other factors outside our control, each of which may prevent us from making predictions of revenue with any certainty and could cause us to experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results.\nDue to the challenges from our lengthy sales cycle, our recognition of revenue from our selling efforts may be substantially delayed, our ability to forecast our future revenue may be more limited and our revenue may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe face risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, threatened health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our manufacturing, sales and other operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, such as COVID-19. The pandemic or other such health crisis could impact our supply operations; for example, if any of our suppliers cease operating, causing us to move production to an alternate supplier. In addition, constraints on supply operations as a result of a pandemic such as COVID-19 could result in component part shortages due to global capacity constraints, such as the current global capacity constraint we are facing in the supply of component parts, particularly of chipsets and other semiconductor components. Such a constraint could and has caused lead times for our products to increase. In an effort to halt the outbreak of a pandemic such as COVID-19, governments may place significant restrictions on travel, such as the restrictions placed by the Chinese government on travel within China, leading to extended business closures, including closures at our third-party manufacturers. Although most of the restrictions on operations of our third-party manufacturers and other suppliers as a result of COVID-19 have been lifted or eased, our suppliers and third-party manufacturers could continue to be disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, or other travel or health-related restrictions and such restrictions could spread to other locations where we outsource manufacture or distribution of our products if the virus and its variants continues to spread or resurge. If our supply chain operations are affected or are curtailed by the outbreak of diseases such as COVID-19, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments will be delayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations and customer relationships. We may need to seek alternate sources of supply which may be more expensive, unavailable or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers. Further, if our distributors\u2019 or end user customers\u2019 businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, freight and logistics constraints caused in part by restrictions imposed by governments to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and additionally due to container and carriage shortages, have resulted in increased costs and constrained available transport, for us and our channel partners, all at a time when global demand has increased. If our supply chain operations continue to be affected or are curtailed by the outbreak of diseases such as COVID-19, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments will be delayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations and customer relationships. We have sought and may continue to seek alternate sources of supply which may be more expensive, unavailable or may result in delays in shipments to us and from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers.\nWe are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and virtualization or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events, among other modifications. Our business is dependent on travel of our sales, operations, quality and technical support, and other managers and employees. Limitations placed on travel globally could limit our ability to manage post-contract support and maintenance activities. Other companies as well as many governments have imposed restrictions on business operations and other precautionary and preemptive actions to address COVID-19, and they may take further actions that cause us or our customers or suppliers to alter their normal business operations. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders. Any such alterations or modifications may adversely impact our business, our customers and prospects, or our financial results.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic will impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, the potential resurgence of COVID-19 or other pandemic and its variants in the future, future government actions in response to the crisis, the acceptance and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. We cannot at this time quantify or forecast the business impact of COVID-19, and there can be no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic or other health crisis will not have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition.\nWe may undertake further restructuring activities, which may adversely impact our operations, and we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these activities or any potential future restructurings. Any restructuring activities may harm our business.\nWe continue to evaluate our business to determine the potential need to realign our resources as we continue to transform our business to achieve desired cost savings in an increasingly competitive market. In prior years, we have undertaken a series of steps to restructure our operations involving, among other things and depending on the year, reductions of our workforce, the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the reduction and outsourcing of manufacturing activities. We incurred restructuring charges of $0.2 million, $2.3 million and $4.0 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe have based our restructuring efforts on assumptions and plans regarding the appropriate cost structure of our business based on our product mix and projected sales, among other factors. Some of our assumptions include the elimination of jobs and the outsourcing of certain functions to reduce our operating expenses. These assumptions may not be accurate and we may not be able to operate in accordance with our plans. Should this occur we may determine that we must incur additional restructuring charges in the future. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will realize all of the anticipated benefits of our restructuring actions or that we will not further reduce or otherwise adjust our workforce or exit, or dispose of, certain businesses and product lines. Any decision to further limit investment, exit, or disposal of businesses or product lines may result in the recording of additional restructuring charges. Consequently, the costs actually incurred in connection with the restructuring efforts may be higher than originally planned and may not lead to the anticipated cost savings and/or improved results. For example, if we consolidate additional facilities in the future, we may incur additional restructuring and related expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe must continue to increase our revenues and/or reduce costs if we hope to maintain profitability.\nAs measured under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we recorded net income of $21.2 million in fiscal 2022, compared to $110.1 million in fiscal 2021 and $0.3 million in fiscal 2020. We generated cash from operations of $2.8 million, $17.3 million and $17.5 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net income of $110.1 million in fiscal 2021 included a $90.4 million release of net change in deferred tax assets.\nThroughout fiscal 2022, we experienced price competition for new business in all regions while major customer consolidations from prior years also put pressure on revenue and gross margin. In addition, we saw pricing pressures in all markets, particularly in international markets. Customer consolidation may have an increasing negative impact on our revenue if Aviat is not selected as a vendor for the products and/or services we provide. To counter pricing pressures, we invested heavily in product improvements to reduce unit costs and enhance product features, decreased overall company expenses, and worked with our vendors to attain more favorable pricing. If we are unable to reduce product unit costs associated with enhanced product features, including payments to contract manufacturers and other suppliers, or achieve the projected cost reductions, we may not maintain profitability.\nWe cannot be certain that these actions or others that we may take will allow us to maintain operating profitability or net income as determined under U.S. GAAP in the future.\nOur quarterly results may be volatile, which can adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly operating results may vary significantly for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside our control. These factors could harm our business and include, among others:\n\u2022seasonality in the purchasing habits of our customers;\n\u2022the volume and timing of product orders and the timing of completion of our product deliveries and installations due to the length of our sales cycle;\n\u2022our ability and the ability of our key suppliers to respond to changes on demand as needed due to component shortages or other supply chain constraints;\n\u2022margin variability based on geographic and product mix;\n\u2022litigation costs and expenses;\n\u2022continued timely rollout of new product functionality and features;\n\u2022increased competition resulting in downward pressure on the price of our products and services;\n\u2022maintaining appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments;\n\u2022failure to realize expected cost improvement throughout our supply chain, or the incurrence of cost increases;\n\u2022order cancellations or postponements in product deliveries, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in delayed revenue recognition;\n\u2022restructuring and streamlining of our operations, and associated timing of charges or write-offs;\n\u2022natural disasters, or other catastrophic events including war and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022diseases or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and corresponding governmental actions;\n\u2022the ability of our customers to obtain financing to enable their purchase of our products;\n\u2022fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;\n\u2022regulatory developments including denial of export and import licenses; and,\n\u2022general economic conditions worldwide that affect demand and financing for microwave and millimeter wave telecommunications networks.\nOur quarterly results are expected to be difficult to predict and delays in product delivery or closing a sale can cause revenue, margins and net income or loss to fluctuate significantly from anticipated levels. A substantial portion of our contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are large orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability and can increase our inventory. The number of large new transactions also increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions. In addition, we may increase spending in response to competitive actions, in pursuit of new market opportunities, or to mitigate supply chain disruptions. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to achieve profitability in the future or that if profitability is attained, that we will be able to sustain profitability, particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\nOur success will depend on new products introduced to the marketplace in a timely manner, successfully completing product transitioning and achieving customer acceptance.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. Our future success will depend, in part, on continuous, timely development and introduction of new products and enhancements that address evolving market requirements and are attractive to customers. If we fail to develop or introduce, on a timely basis, new products or product enhancements or features that achieve market acceptance, our business may suffer. Additionally, we work closely with a variety of third-party partners to develop new product features and new platforms. Should our partners face delays in the development process, then the timing of the rollout of our new products may be significantly impacted which may negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. Another factor impacting our future success is the growth in the customer demand of our new products. Rapidly changing technology, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product life cycles and changes in customer requirements characterize the markets for our products. We believe that successful new product introductions provide a significant competitive advantage because of the significant resources committed by customers in adopting new products and their reluctance to change products after these resources have been expended. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources on internal research and development to support our effort to develop and introduce new products and enhancements.\nAs we transition to new product platforms, we face significant risk that the development of our new products may not be accepted by our current customers or by new customers. To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products that are adopted by customers, we could fail to obtain an adequate return on these investments and could lose market share to our competitors, which could be difficult or impossible to regain. Similarly, we may face decreased revenue, gross margins and profitability due to a rapid decline in sales of current products as customers hold spending to focus purchases on new product platforms. We could incur significant costs in completing the transition, including costs of inventory write-downs of the current product as customers transition to new product platforms. In addition, products or technologies developed by others may render our products non-competitive or obsolete and result in significant reduction in orders from our customers and the loss of existing and prospective customers.\nWe rely on various third-party service partners to help complement our global operations, and failure to adequately manage these relationships could adversely impact our financial results and relationships with customers.\nWe rely on a number of third-party service partners, to complement our global operations. We rely upon these partners for certain installation, maintenance, logistics and support functions. In addition, as our customers increasingly seek to rely on vendors to perform additional services relating to the design, construction and operation of their networks, the scope of work performed by our service partners is likely to increase and may include areas where we have less experience providing or managing such services. We must successfully identify, assess, train and certify qualified service partners to ensure the proper installation, deployment and maintenance of our products. The vetting and certification of these partners can be costly and time-consuming, and certain partners may not have the same operational history, financial resources and scale as we have. Moreover, certain service partners may provide similar services for\nother companies, including our competitors. We may not be able to manage our relationships with our service partners effectively, and we cannot be certain that they will be able to deliver services in the manner or time required, that we will be able to maintain the continuity of their services, or that they will adhere to our approach to ethical business practices. Our service partners may also experience challenges in providing services to us as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may also be exposed to a number of risks or challenges relating to the performance of our service partners, including:\n\u2022delays in recognizing revenue;\n\u2022liability for injuries to persons, damage to property or other claims relating to the actions or omissions of our service partners;\n\u2022our services revenue and gross margin may be adversely affected; and\n\u2022our relationships with customers could suffer.\nIf we do not effectively manage our relationships with third-party service partners, or if they fail to perform these services in the manner or time required, our financial results and relationships with our customers could be adversely affected.\nWe must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful.\nThe optical transport networking equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. We continually invest in research and development to sustain or enhance our existing products, but the introduction of new communications technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or requirements could render our products obsolete. Further, in developing our products, we have made, and will continue to make, assumptions with respect to which standards or requirements will be adopted by our customers and competitors. If the standards or requirements adopted by our prospective customers are different from those on which we have focused our efforts, market acceptance of our products would be reduced or delayed, and our business would be harmed.\nWe are continuing to invest a significant portion of our research and development efforts in the development of our next-generation products. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their existing products and introduce new products and technologies and to influence customers\u2019 buying criteria so as to emphasize product capabilities that we do not, or may not, possess. To be competitive, we must anticipate future customer requirements and continue to invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. If we do not anticipate these future customer requirements and invest in the technologies necessary to enable us to have and to sell the appropriate solutions, it may limit our competitive position and future sales, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not have sufficient resources to make these investments and we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive.\nOur average sales prices may decline in the future.\nWe have experienced, and could continue to experience, declining sales prices. This price pressure is likely to result in downward pricing pressure on our products and services. As a result, we are likely to experience declining average sales prices for our products. Our future profitability will depend upon our ability to improve manufacturing efficiencies, to reduce the costs of materials used in our products and to continue to introduce new lower-cost products and product enhancements and if we are unable to do so, we may not be able to respond to pricing pressures. If we are unable to respond to increased price competition, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. Because customers frequently negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates, we may be required to commit to price reductions for our products before we are aware of how, or if, cost reductions can be obtained. As a result, current or future price reduction commitments and any inability on our part to respond to increased price competition could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit and commercial risks and exposures could increase if the financial condition of our customers declines.\nA substantial portion of our sales are to customers in the telecommunications industry. These customers may require their suppliers, including the Company, to provide extended payment terms, direct loans or other forms of financial support as a condition to obtaining commercial contracts. In addition, if local currencies cannot be hedged, we have an inherent exposure in our ability to convert monies at favorable rates from or to U.S. dollars. More generally, we\nexpect to routinely enter into long-term contracts involving significant amounts to be paid by our customers over time. Pursuant to these contracts, we may deliver products and services representing an important portion of the contract price before receiving any significant payment from the customer. As a result of the financing that may be provided to customers and our commercial risk exposure under long-term contracts, our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes. Over the past few years, certain of our customers have filed with the courts seeking protection under the bankruptcy or reorganization laws of the applicable jurisdiction or have experienced financial difficulties. Our customers\u2019 financial conditions face additional challenges in many emerging markets, where our customers are being affected not only by recession, but by deteriorating local currencies and a lack of credit and, more broadly, by the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic effects. If customers fail to meet their obligations to us, we may experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of reserves, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nOur business requires extensive credit risk management that may not be adequate to protect against customer nonpayment. A risk of non-payment by customers is a significant focus of our business. We expect a significant amount of future revenue to come from international customers in developing countries. We do not generally expect to obtain collateral for sales, although we require letters of credit or credit insurance as appropriate for international customers. For information regarding the percentage of revenue attributable to certain key customers, see \u201cRisk Factors - Business and Operational Risk Factors - Because a significant amount of our revenue may come from a limited number of customers, the termination of any of these customer relationships may adversely affect our business.\u201d Our historical accounts receivable balances have been concentrated in a small number of significant customers. Unexpected adverse events impacting the financial condition of our customers, bank failures or other unfavorable regulatory, economic or political events in the countries in which we do business may impact collections and adversely impact our business, require increased bad debt expense or receivable write-offs and adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and operating results, which could also result in a breach of our bank covenants.\nOur restructuring actions could harm our relationships with our employees and impact our ability to recruit new employees.\nEmployees, whether or not directly affected by any restructuring actions that we undertake, may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors. We cannot assure that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will not be compromised by any such employees who terminate their employment with us. Further, we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce reductions, and we may terminate the employment of employees as part of a restructuring and later determine that such employees were important to the success of the ongoing business.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, professional, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. Historically, competition for these key personnel has been intense. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, or the loss of key personnel to competitors could make it difficult for us to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals.\nWe face strong competition for maintaining and improving our position in the market, which can adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results.\nThe wireless access, interconnection and backhaul business is a specialized segment of the wireless telecommunications industry and is extremely competitive. Competition in this segment is intense, and we expect it to increase. Some of our competitors have more extensive engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities and significantly greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, some of our competitors have greater name recognition, broader product lines, a larger installed base of products and longer-standing customer relationships. Our competitors include established companies, such as Ericsson, Huawei, NEC and Nokia, as well as a number of other public and private companies, such as Ceragon and SIAE. Some of our competitors are OEMs or systems integrators through whom we market and sell our products, which means our business success may depend on these competitors to some extent. One or more of our largest customers could internally develop the capability to\nmanufacture products similar to those manufactured or outsourced by us and, as a result, the demand for our products and services may decrease.\nIn addition, we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with many entities that have substantially greater resources than we have. Our competitors may enter business combinations to accelerate product development or to compete more aggressively and we may lack the resources to meet such enhanced competition.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including price, quality, availability, customer service and support, breadth of product lines, product performance and features, rapid time-to-market delivery capabilities, reliability, timing of new product introductions by us, our customers and competitors, the ability of our customers to obtain financing and the stability of regional sociopolitical and geopolitical circumstances, and the ability of large competitors to obtain business by providing more seller financing especially for large transactions. We can give no assurances that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise, or marketing, sales, distribution, customer service and support capabilities to compete successfully, or that regional sociopolitical and geographic circumstances will be favorable for our successful operation.\nOur ability to sell our products and compete successfully is highly dependent on the quality of our customer service and support, and our failure to offer high quality service and support could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOnce our products are delivered, our customers depend on our service and support to resolve any issues relating to our products. Our support personnel includes employees in various geographic locations, who provide general technical support to our customers. A high level of support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our products. If we do not effectively help our customers quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing customers as well as demand for maintenance and renewal contracts and could harm our reputation with existing and potential customers.\nProduct performance problems, including undetected errors in our hardware or software, or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation.\nThe development and production of products with high technology content is complicated and often involves problems with hardware, software, components and manufacturing methods. Complex hardware and software systems, such as our products, can often contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released. In addition, errors associated with components we purchase from third parties, including customized components, may be difficult to resolve. We have experienced issues in the past in connection with our products, including failures due to the receipt of faulty components from our suppliers and performance issues related to software updates. From time to time we have had to replace certain components or provide software remedies or other remediation in response to errors or bugs, and we may have to do so again in the future. In addition, performance issues can be heightened during periods where we are developing and introducing multiple new products to the market, as any performance issues we encounter in one technology or product could impact the performance or timing of delivery of other products. Our products may also suffer degradation of performance and reliability over time.\nIf reliability, quality, security or network monitoring problems develop, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including:\n\u2022reduced orders from existing customers;\n\u2022declining interest from potential customers;\n\u2022delays in our ability to recognize revenue or in collecting accounts receivables;\n\u2022costs associated with fixing hardware or software defects or replacing products;\n\u2022high service and warranty expenses;\n\u2022delays in shipments;\n\u2022high inventory excess and obsolescence expense;\n\u2022high levels of product returns;\n\u2022diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts; and\n\u2022payment of liquidated damages, performance guarantees or similar penalties.\nBecause we outsource the manufacturing of certain components of our products, we may also be subject to product performance problems as a result of the acts or omissions of third parties, and we may not have adequate compensating remedies against such third parties.\nFrom time to time, we encounter interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer\u2019s site. These interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from issues with installation and activation, some of which are outside our control. If we experience significant interruptions or delays that we cannot promptly resolve, the associated revenue for these installations may be delayed or confidence in our products could be undermined, which could cause us to lose customers, fail to add new customers, and consequently harm our financial results.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements or customer demand, we could incur additional costs, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements or forecast customer demand, we may incur additional costs of manufacturing and our gross margins and financial results could be adversely affected. If we overestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may experience an oversupply of components and assess us charges for excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. If we underestimate our requirements, our contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory or components, which could interrupt manufacturing and result in higher manufacturing costs, shipment delays, damage to customer relationships and/or our payment of penalties to our customers. Our contract manufacturers also have other customers and may not have sufficient capacity to meet all of their customers\u2019 needs, including ours, during periods of excess demand.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships, we could incur additional costs or be unable to timely fulfill our customer commitments, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations and, in the event of an inability to fulfill commitments, would harm our customer relationships.\nWe outsource all of our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our repair service operations to independent contract manufacturers and other third parties. Our contract manufacturers typically manufacture our products based on rolling forecasts of our product needs that we provide to them on a regular basis. The contract manufacturers are responsible for procuring components necessary to build our products based on our rolling forecasts, building and assembling the products, testing the products in accordance with our specifications and then shipping the products to us. We configure the products to our customer requirements, conduct final testing and then ship the products to our customers. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter problems with our contract manufacturer related to these manufacturing services or that we will be able to replace a contract manufacturer that is not able to meet our demand.\nIn addition, if we fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers or other service providers, or if they do not fully comply with their contractual obligations or should experience delays, disruptions, component procurement problems or quality control problems, then our ability to ship products to our customers or otherwise fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers could be delayed or impaired which would adversely affect our business, financial results and customer relationships.\nWe depend on sole or limited sources and geographies for some key components and failure to receive timely delivery of any of these components could result in deferred or lost sales.\nIn some instances, we are dependent upon one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because of local content preference requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. Examples of sole or limited sourcing categories include metal fabrications and castings, for which we own the tooling and therefore limit our supplier relationships, and MMICs (a type of integrated circuit used in manufacturing microwave radios), which we procure at a volume discount from a single source. Additionally, certain semiconductor supply is concentrated in Taiwan, with little to no availability in other geographies. As such, any military conflict between Taiwan and China could interrupt supply.\nOur supply chain strategy includes mitigation plans for alternative manufacturing sources and identified alternate suppliers. However, if these alternatives cannot address our requirements when our existing sources of these components fail to deliver them on time, we could suffer delayed shipments, canceled orders and lost or deferred revenues, as well as\nmaterial damage to our customer relationships. Should this occur, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause a significant amount of our revenue may come from a limited number of customers, the termination of any of these customer relationships may adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we have a large customer base, during any given quarter or fiscal year a small number of customers may account for a significant portion of our revenue. Principal customers for our products and services include domestic and international wireless/mobile service providers, OEMs, as well as private network users such as public safety agencies; government institutions; and utility, pipeline, railroad and other industrial enterprises that operate broadband wireless networks. During fiscal 2022, Motorola accounted for 13% of our total revenue, comprised of approximately 70 number of discrete projects. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021.\nIn addition, the telecommunications industry has experienced significant consolidation among its participants, and we expect this trend to continue. Some operators in this industry have experienced financial difficulty and have filed, or may file, for bankruptcy protection. Other operators may merge and one or more of our competitors may supply products to the customers of the combined company following those mergers. This consolidation could result in purchasing decision delays and decreased opportunities for us to supply products to companies following any consolidation. This consolidation may also result in lost opportunities for cost reduction and economies of scale, and could generally reduce our opportunities to win new customers to the extent that the number of potential customers decreases. Furthermore, as our customers become larger, they may have more leverage to negotiate better pricing which could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.\nIt is possible that a significant portion of our future product sales could become even more concentrated in a limited number of customers due to the factors described above. Product sales to major customers have varied widely from period to period. The loss of any existing customer, a significant reduction in the level of sales to any existing customer, the consolidation of existing customers, or our inability to gain additional customers could result in declines in our revenue or an inability to grow revenue.\nWe continually evaluate strategic transaction opportunities which could involve merger, divestiture, sale and/or acquisition activities that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions, or \u201ctuck-ins,\u201d product lines, technologies, and personnel. Strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the combined companies, particularly companies with large and widespread operations and/or complex products;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from business combinations, sales, divestitures and/or restructurings;\n\u2022potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles;\n\u2022difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in each market have stronger market positions;\n\u2022initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n\u2022insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees, customers, resellers, vendors and other business partners of our company or the companies with which we engage in strategic transactions following and continuing after announcement of an anticipated strategic transaction.\nStrategic transactions may also cause us to:\n\u2022issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders or cause a change in control of the combined company;\n\u2022use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt;\n\u2022significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition;\n\u2022assume material liabilities;\n\u2022record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u2022incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost sharing arrangement and legal structure;\n\u2022incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; and\n\u2022become subject to intellectual property or other litigation.\nMergers, restructurings, sales and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control. No assurance can be given that any future strategic transactions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully complete a strategic transaction could materially harm our business and operating results. Even when an acquired or acquiring company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain distribution and licensing relationships, our revenue may decrease.\nAlthough a majority of our sales are made through our direct sales force, we also market our products through indirect sales channels such as independent agents, resellers, OEMs and systems integrators. These relationships enhance our ability to pursue major contract awards and, in some cases, are intended to provide our customers with easier access to financing and a greater variety of equipment and service capabilities, which an integrated system provider should be able to offer. We may not be able to maintain our current relationships or develop new ones. If additional relationships are developed, they may not be successful. Furthermore, as we consider increasing licensing revenue based on upgraded technology, we may not be successful in transitioning customers to the planned software upgrades. Our inability to establish or maintain these distribution and licensing relationships could restrict our ability to market our products and thereby result in significant reductions in revenue. If these revenue reductions occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nFinancial and Macroeconomic Risk Factors\nDue to the volume of our international sales, we may be susceptible to a number of political, economic and geographic risks that could harm our business.\nWe are highly dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. In fiscal 2022, our sales to international customers accounted for 34% of total revenue. Significant portions of our international sales are in less developed countries. Our international sales are likely to continue to account for a large percentage of our products and services revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, the occurrence of any international, political, economic or geographic event could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nSome of the risks and challenges of doing business internationally include:\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022fluctuations in international currency exchange rates including its impact on unhedgeable currencies and our forecast variations for hedgeable currencies;\n\u2022imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions;\n\u2022management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries;\n\u2022the burden of complying with a variety of laws and regulations in various countries;\n\u2022application of the income tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions, including relatively low-rate and relatively high-rate jurisdictions, to our sales and other transactions, which results in additional complexity and uncertainty;\n\u2022the conduct of unethical business practices in developing countries;\n\u2022general economic and geopolitical conditions, including inflation and trade relationships;\n\u2022restrictions on travel to locations where we conduct business, including those imposed due to COVID-19;\n\u2022war and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022kidnapping and high crime rate;\n\u2022natural disasters;\n\u2022availability of U.S. dollars especially in countries with economies highly dependent on resource exports, particularly oil; and\n\u2022changes in export regulations.\nWhile these factors and the impacts of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management\u2019s override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, the available line of credit under our credit facility and future cash collections from customers will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. However, it is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our longer-term capital needs. If this occurs, we may need to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, or obtain additional equity or debt financing. We have no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms if and when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders.\nThe effects of global or market specific financial and economic conditions have, and may continue to have, significant effects on our customers and suppliers, and have in the past, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price.\nThe effects of global financial and economic conditions in certain markets include, among other things, significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from credit markets, supply or demand driven inflationary pressures, and substantial fluctuations in currency values worldwide.\nEconomic conditions in certain markets have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our customers\u2019 access to capital and/or willingness to spend capital on our products, and/or their levels of cash liquidity and/or their ability and/or willingness to pay for products that they will order or have already ordered from us, or result in their ceasing operations. Further, we have experienced an increasing number of our customers, principally in emerging markets, requesting longer payment terms, lease or vendor financing arrangements, longer terms for the letters of credit securing purchases of our products and services, which could potentially negatively impact our orders, revenue conversion cycle, and cash flows.\nIn seeking to reduce their expenses, we have also seen significant pressure from our customers to lower prices for our products as they try to improve their operating performance and procure additional capital equipment within their reduced budget levels. To the extent that we lower prices on our products and services, our orders, revenues, and gross margins may be negatively impacted. Additionally, certain emerging markets are particularly sensitive to pricing as a key differentiator. Where price is a primary decision driver, we may not be able to effectively compete, or we may choose not to compete due to unacceptable margins.\nIn addition, economic conditions in certain markets could materially adversely affect our suppliers\u2019 access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventories, production levels, or product quality, could cause them to raise prices or lower production levels, or result in their ceasing operations. Supply or demand driven scarcity can lead to significant inflationary pressures on the cost of our products from our suppliers. Our ability to substantially offset inflationary impacts by raising prices may be limited by the competitive factors discussed above.\nFurther, with respect to our credit facility discussed under \u201cLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Strategies\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our ability to access the funds available under our credit facility could be materially adversely affected.\nThe potential effects of these economic factors are difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a consequence, our operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price.\nChanges in tax laws, treaties, rulings, regulations or agreements, or their interpretation in any country in which we operate; the loss of a major tax dispute; a successful challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries; or other factors could cause volatility in our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions and our profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022our ability to utilize net operating loss;\n\u2022changes in available tax credits;\n\u2022changes in share-based compensation expense;\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022changes in domestic or international tax laws, treaties, rulings, regulations or agreements or the interpretation of such tax laws, treaties, rulings, regulations or agreements, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and any new administrations;\n\u2022the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including the loss of a major tax dispute;\n\u2022local tax authority challenging our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries;\n\u2022the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods; and\n\u2022taxes that may be incurred upon a repatriation of cash from foreign operations.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could impact our results of operations for future periods adversely.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other tax benefits may be limited.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset if a corporation experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when a company\u2019s \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d) following an ownership change.\nIf we experience an ownership change, our ability to use our NOLs, any loss or deduction attributable to a \u201cnet unrealized built-in loss\u201d and other tax attributes (collectively, the \u201cTax Benefits\u201d) could be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Benefits could be substantially delayed, which could significantly impair the value of the Tax Benefits. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the Tax Benefits and we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance related to the amount of the Tax Benefits that may not be realized, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe believe that these Tax Benefits are a valuable asset for us. On September 6, 2016, the Board adopted certain amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCharter Amendments\u201d), to protect our tax benefits. In addition, on March 3, 2020, the Board approved The Plan (as amended and restated on August 27, 2020, in an effort to protect our Tax Benefits during the effective period of the Plan. We submitted the Plan to a stockholder vote and our stockholders approved the plan at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Although the Plan and the Charter Amendments are intended to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the Plan and the Charter Amendments will prevent all transfers that could result in such an \u201cownership change.\u201d There also can be no assurance that the transfer restrictions in the Charter Amendments will be enforceable against all of our stockholders absent a court determination confirming such enforceability. The transfer restrictions may be subject to challenge on legal or equitable grounds.\nThe Plan and the Charter Amendments could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, us or a large block of our common stock. A third party that acquires 4.9% or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the Plan through the issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents to all stockholders other than the acquiring person. The acquisition may also be void under the Charter Amendments.\nThe foregoing provisions may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging potential investors from acquiring our stock. In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our stockholders.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA portion of our sales and expenses stem from countries outside of the United States, and are in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuation. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency rates could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods. We currently enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted foreign currency expenses. These forward contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain transactions, but do not cover all foreign-denominated transactions and therefore do not entirely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk Factors\nContinued tension in U.S.-China trade relations may adversely impact our supply chain operations and business.\nThe U.S. government has taken certain actions that change U.S. trade policies, including tariffs that affect certain products manufactured in China. Some components manufactured by our Chinese suppliers are subject to tariffs if imported into the United States. The Chinese government has taken certain reciprocal actions, including recently imposed tariffs affecting certain products manufactured in the United States. Certain of our products manufactured in our\nU.S. operations have been included in the tariffs imposed on imports into China from the United States. Although some of the products and components we import are affected by the tariffs, at this time, we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIt is unknown whether and to what extent additional new tariffs (or other new laws or regulations) will be adopted that increase the cost or feasibility of importing and/or exporting products and components from China to the United States and vice versa. Further, the effect of any such new tariffs or retaliatory actions on our industry and customers is unknown and difficult to predict. As additional new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if China or other affected countries take retaliatory trade actions, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may be deprived of legal recourse against those who misappropriate our intellectual property.\nOur ability to compete will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology in the U.S. and internationally. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents, contractual rights and technological measures to protect our intellectual property rights from infringement, misappropriation or other violations to maintain our brand and competitive position. We also make business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. With respect to patents, we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any currently pending patent application or future patent applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products or intellectual property owned by others. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable or narrowed in scope. We also cannot provide assurances that the protection provided to our intellectual property by the laws and courts of particular nations will be substantially similar to the protection and remedies available under U.S. law. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurances that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us based on intellectual property rights and laws in other nations that are different from those established in the U.S.\nIn addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and enter into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party who has developed intellectual property on our behalf and each party that has or may have had access to our confidential information, know-how and trade secrets. These agreements may be insufficient or breached, or may not effectively prevent unauthorized access to or unauthorized use, disclosure, misappropriation or reverse engineering of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Moreover, these agreements may not provide an adequate remedy for breaches or in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or technology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret or know-how is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.\nWe cannot give assurances that any steps taken by us will be adequate to deter infringement, misappropriation, dilution or otherwise impede independent third-party development of similar technologies. Any of our intellectual property rights may be successfully challenged, opposed, diluted, misappropriated or circumvented by others or invalidated, narrowed in scope or held unenforceable through administrative process or litigation in the United States or in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, intellectual property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. In the event that such intellectual property arrangements are insufficient, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nIf sufficient radio frequency spectrum is not allocated for use by our products, or we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products, our ability to market our products may be restricted.\nWe may be affected by the allocation and auction of the radio frequency spectrum by governmental authorities both in the U.S. and internationally. The unavailability of sufficient radio frequency spectrum may inhibit the future growth of wireless communications networks. In addition, to operate in a jurisdiction, we must obtain regulatory approval for our products and each jurisdiction in which we market our products has its own regulations governing radio communications. If we are unable to obtain sufficient allocation of radio frequency spectrum by the appropriate\ngovernmental authority or obtain the proper regulatory approval for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and anti-bribery measures which have resulted in increased costs and may continue to result in additional costs or potential liabilities in the future.\nWe are subject to rules and regulations of federal and state regulatory authorities, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) and financial market entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and foreign and domestic legislative bodies. During the past few years, these entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, NASDAQ and several foreign governments, have issued requirements, laws and regulations and continue to develop additional requirements, laws and regulations, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), and recent laws and regulations regarding bribery and unfair competition, including the SEC\u2019s recently-proposed rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks. Our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of substantial management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nMoreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs potentially necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. Finally, if we are unable to ensure compliance with such requirements, laws, or regulations, we may be subject to costly prosecution and liability, and resulting reputational harm, from such noncompliance.\nOur products are used in critical communications networks which may subject us to significant liability claims.\nBecause our products are used in critical communications networks, we may be subject to significant liability claims if our products do not work properly. We warrant to our current customers that our products will operate in accordance with our product specifications. If our products fail to conform to these specifications, our customers could require us to remedy the failure or could assert claims for damages. The provisions in our agreements with customers that are intended to limit our exposure to liability claims may not preclude all potential claims. In addition, any insurance policies we have may not adequately limit our exposure with respect to such claims. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. Any such claims, whether or not successful, would be costly and time-consuming to defend, and could divert management\u2019s attention and seriously damage our reputation and our business.\nWe may be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property. This litigation could be costly to defend and resolve and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology.\nThe wireless telecommunications industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in often protracted and expensive litigation. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Such litigation or claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the use and transfer of allegedly infringing technology or the sale of allegedly infringing products and expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses for the infringing technology. We can give no assurances that we would be successful in developing such non-infringing technology or that any license for the infringing technology would be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. This could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition, competitive position and prospects.\nWe are subject to laws, rules, regulations and policies regarding data privacy and security. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and reinterpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations or other harm to our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, directives, rules and policies relating to data privacy and security. The regulatory framework for data privacy and security worldwide is continuously evolving and developing and, as a result, interpretation and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for\nthe foreseeable future. It is also possible inquiries from governmental authorities regarding cybersecurity breaches increase in frequency and scope. These data privacy and security laws also are not uniform, which may complicate and increase our costs for compliance. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with any applicable laws relating to data privacy and security, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized access, improper disclosure, or misappropriation of personal data or other customer data, could result in significant liabilities, and negative publicity and reputational harm, one or all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operations.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to protection of the environment that could materially and adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations, as well as those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers.\nEnvironmental, health and safety regulations govern the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, including without limitation regulations governing the emission of pollutants and the use, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials (including electronic wastes). Our failure or the failure of our suppliers or contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of wastes generated from our operations could subject us to increased compliance costs or liabilities such as fines and penalties. We may also be subject to costs and liabilities for environmental clean-up costs on sites owned by us, sites previously owned by us, or treatment and disposal of wastes attributable to us from past operations, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or equivalent laws. Existing and future environmental regulations may additionally restrict our and our suppliers\u2019 use of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products. New or more stringent environmental requirements applicable to our operations or the operations of our suppliers could adversely affect our costs of doing business and result in material costs to our operations.\nIncreased attention to Environmental, Social, and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters and conservation measures may adversely impact our business.\nIncreasing attention to, and societal expectations on companies to address, climate change and other environmental and social impacts, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures may result in increased costs to us and our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and customers. Moreover, while we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters. Additionally, on March 21, 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks. We are currently assessing the rule, but at this time we cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the rule. To the extent this rule is finalized as proposed, we could incur increased costs relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks.\nIncreased focus on climate change issues has contributed to an evolving state of environmental regulation relating to climate change, and uncertainty related to such regulation, as well as physical risks of climate change, could impact our results of operations, financial or competitive position.\nIncreased public awareness and worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and may result in more international, federal or regional requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate risks related to climate change. As a result, we may become subject to new or more stringent regulations, legislation or other governmental requirements or industry standards, and we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products, reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, and increasing energy efficiency. Increased regulation of climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions and require us to make certain changes to our manufacturing practices and/or product designs, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events such as terrorism and war could have an adverse effect on our business.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, extreme weather conditions and floods, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. In addition, climate change may contribute to the increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events, including storms, wildfires, and other natural disasters. Further, acts of terrorism or war could significantly disrupt our supply chain and access to vital components. Such events have in the past and could [in the future] result in physical damage to one or more of our facilities, the temporary closure of one or more of our facilities or those of our suppliers, a temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, a temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from local or overseas suppliers or contract manufacturers, a temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, and delays in the delivery of goods. Accordingly, climate change and natural disasters may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy necessary for our operations, and could also increase insurance and other operating costs. Many of our facilities around the world (and the operations of our suppliers) are in locations that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our facilities or those of our suppliers, such as loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. In addition, if there is a natural disaster in any of the locations in which our significant customers are located, our customers may incur losses or sustained business interruption, or both, which may materially impair their ability to continue their purchase of products from us. Public health issues, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have an adverse impact on customer demand. As a result of any of these events, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive components from suppliers. Although we maintain business interruption insurance and other insurance intended to cover some or all of these risks, such insurance may be inadequate, whether because of coverage amount, policy limitations, the financial viability of the insurance companies issuing such policies, or other reasons.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, and cyber-attacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations and harm public perception of our security products, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer and adversely affect our stock price.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and proprietary information of our customers, suppliers and business partners, on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Increasingly, companies, including ours, are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to interruption, disruption, penetration or attacks due to natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, domestic vandalism, Internet failures, computer malware, ransomware, cyberattacks, data breaches and other events unforeseen or generally beyond our control. Any such breach could compromise our systems and networks, which could cause system disruptions or slowdowns and exploitation of the security vulnerabilities in our products, and lead to the information stored on our networks being accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, and cause us reputational and financial harm. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our networks. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased number of our employees and service providers are working from home and connecting to our networks remotely on less secure systems, which we believe may further increase the risk of, and our vulnerability to, a cyber-attack or breach on our network.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our security products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by computer programmers and hackers, many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded, to access or sabotage networks or systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these cyber-attacks. This could impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. In addition, the economic costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software\nsystems and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure because the damage may differ based on the identity and motive of the programmer or hacker, which are often difficult to identify.\nAs cyber-attacks become more sophisticated, the need to develop, modify, upgrade or enhance our information technology infrastructure and measures to secure our business can lead to increased cybersecurity protection costs. Such costs may include making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants. These efforts come at the potential cost of revenues and human resources that could be utilized to continue to enhance our product offerings, and such increased costs may adversely affect our operating margins.\nAdditionally, certain of our suppliers have in the past and may in the future experience cybersecurity attacks that can constrain their capacity and ability to meet our product demands. If our contract manufacturers and suppliers suffer future cyberattacks, our ability to ship products or otherwise fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers could be delayed or impaired which would adversely affect our business, financial results and customer relationships.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2022 we completed the $7.5 million stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in May 2018. This repurchase program was temporarily suspended from February 2020 to February 2021. In November 2021 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to purchase up to $10.0 million of our common stock. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 we repurchased $5.4 million, $0.8 million and $1.8 million of our common stock in the open market respectively. As of July 1, 2022, $7.3 million remained available for repurchase under our November 2021 stock repurchase program.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, the Plan, and provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nBecause we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be supported by our stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, which prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws also contain certain provisions that may make a third-party acquisition of us difficult, including the ability of the Board to issue preferred stock and the requirement that nominations for directors and other proposals by stockholders must be made in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected or the proposals are voted upon.\nIn addition, the Plan and the Charter Amendments could make an acquisition of us more difficult, and certain acquisitions may also be void under the Charter Amendments. The risks associated with the Plan and the Charter Amendments are described in more detail above under the heading \u201cOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other tax benefits may be limited.\u201d", "PERMNO": 91836, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "AVNW"}
