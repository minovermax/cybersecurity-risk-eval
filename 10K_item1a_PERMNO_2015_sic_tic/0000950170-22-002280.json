{"cik": "1592058", "company": "Party City Holdco Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. Our business, financial condition, operating results and liquidity can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below and elsewhere in this report. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and stock price.\nCOVID-19\nOur business, operations, financial condition and liquidity have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by COVID-19. and the related macroeconomic impacts, including supply chain inflation, labor shortages and transportation.\nIn general, our retail sales, and the retail sales of our business partners to whom we sell, represent discretionary spending by customers of us and our business partners. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including geopolitical events or widespread health emergencies. COVID-19 and the measures to contain it, including the related macroeconomic impacts, have, and may continue to, materially and adversely impact our business, operations, financial results, liquidity and stock price. Specifically, the pandemic and the measures to contain it by governments, businesses and individuals have materially and adversely impacted the global economy and consumer spending, disrupted global supply chains, have resulted in labor shortages and wage pressures, and created significant volatility and disruption in various industries.\nIn 2020, many of our stores were shut down for a number of months and as a result, our business, financial performance, liquidity and stock price were materially and adversely impacted. While all of our stores have since reopened, our results of operations were further impacted by the continued effects of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants of the virus. In 2021, COVID-19 has, among other things, adversely impacted the purchasing behavior of our customers, led to significant supply chain challenges resulting in increased transportation and distribution costs, and increased labor costs, all of which adversely impacted our operations and financial performance, including our profitability. For additional information on COVID-19 and its adverse impacts on us, see Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - \"COVID-19 Update\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, future economic downturns resulting from the impact of COVID-19 may make it difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand trends, which could cause us to purchase excess inventories, resulting in increases in our inventory carrying cost, or insufficient inventories, resulting in our inability to satisfy our customer demand and potential loss of market share. Further, the disruption to the global economy and to our business, along with the decline in our stock price, may negatively impact the carrying value of certain assets, including inventories, accounts receivable, intangibles and goodwill. Additionally, if the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic continues longer than we expect or the severity worsens, we may need to access other sources of financing, including incurring additional indebtedness, selling our assets and raising additional equity capital. These alternatives may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and stock price.\nThe full extent to which COVID-19 and the measures to contain it will impact our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, its variants and other future developments related to virus response, all of which are highly uncertain, and we expect this uncertainty to continue in 2022 and likely beyond. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our business, operations, financial results and liquidity, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks noted in this report, including in ways that we cannot predict.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face risks related to our balloon business, including regulatory restrictions and prohibitions, potential shortages of helium gas and changes in consumer preferences.\nBalloons are a focal point of our growth strategy and are a key driver of our differentiated brand experience. The ongoing success of our balloon business may be affected by several factors. For example, some local\ngovernments have implemented or considered implementing rules, ordinances or regulations prohibiting the sale of balloons filled with a gas lighter than air. We design and manufacture foil balloons through our Anagram business and sell latex and foil balloons in our retail stores. Widespread adoption of such prohibitions would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe use helium gas, a natural resource, to inflate most of the foil balloons and a portion of the latex balloons we sell to consumers through our retail stores and online. The float of a helium filled balloon is particularly attractive to many consumers and contributes to our ability to sell balloons. Although we believe we have taken appropriate steps to maintain enough helium to keep pace with the demand, we cannot offer assurance that events beyond our control, such a global shortage of helium or supply chain disruptions impacting the ability of helium refineries, distributors, or resellers to provide us or our Anagram customers with enough helium gas to satisfy demand, will not impact our ability to maintain sales levels of balloons. We have experienced periodic helium shortages and such other helium disruptions in the past, which have resulted in, higher prices for such gas, failure to fulfill consumer demand for helium inflated balloons, and failure to fulfill business demand for Anagram balloons. These shortages and disruptions have adversely impacted the financial performance of our retail and wholesale operations in the past, and may have similar impacts in the future.\nChanging consumer preferences, including with respect to environmental matters, whether we can anticipate, identify and respond to them or not, could adversely impact our sales. Inventory levels for certain balloon styles no longer considered to be \u201con trend\u201d may increase, leading to higher markdowns to sell through excess inventory and, therefore, lower than planned margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our balloons, or if we fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost sales. In addition, our position or perceived lack of position on environmental, public policy or other sensitive issues relating to our balloon business, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation.\nThe loss of, or disruption in, one of our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise and our reliance on third parties for shipping could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on our distribution centers to manage the volume associated with a significant amount of our products. Most of our operations\u2019 inventory are shipped directly from vendors to our distribution centers where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to our stores, to our wholesale customers or to our e-commerce customers. We depend on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of the distribution centers. We may not anticipate all of the changing demands that our expanding operations will impose on our receiving and distribution system, and events that we may not fully control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems (whether in our own or in our third party vendors\u2019 or carriers\u2019 businesses), may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores or to our wholesale customers or e-commerce/retail customers. In addition, to the extent we need to add capacity to distribution centers by either leasing or building new distribution centers or adding capacity at existing centers or make changes in our distribution processes to improve efficiency and maximize capacity, such changes may result in significant capital expenditures as well as unanticipated delays or interruptions in distribution.\nWe also depend upon third parties for shipment of a significant amount of merchandise. Interruptions in the services provided by third parties may occasionally result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers, weather-related events, natural disasters, pandemics (including COVID-19), trade policy changes or restrictions, tariffs or import-related taxes, third-party labor disruptions, shipping capacity constraints, third-party contract disputes, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, or other factors beyond our control. An interruption in service by third parties for any reason could cause temporary disruptions in our business, a loss of sales and profits, and other material adverse effects.\nWe operate in a competitive industry, and our failure to compete effectively could cause us to lose market share, revenues and growth prospects.\nOur wholesale segment competes with many other manufacturers and distributors, including smaller, independent manufacturers and distributors and divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies with greater financial\nand other resources than we have. Some of our competitors control licenses for widely recognized images and have broader access to mass market retailers that could provide them with a competitive advantage.\nOur retail stores compete with a variety of smaller and larger retailers including, but not limited to, independent party goods retailers, mass merchants, e-commerce merchandisers, craft stores, grocery retailers, and dollar stores. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector. Internet-based retailers may have a significant collective online presence and may be able to offer similar products to those that we sell, which may result in increased price competition, and consumers may respond more positively to a competitor\u2019s internet-based shopping experience compared to our e-commerce experience. We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in the retail space or do so without substantial capital expenditures. Expansion into markets served by our competitors and entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial performance. We believe remaining competitive in the areas of quality, price, breadth of selection, customer service and convenience is critical to our success. Competing effectively may require us to reduce our prices or increase our costs, which could lower our margins and adversely affect our revenues and growth prospects. For more information about the competition in our industry, see Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our e-commerce business and digital marketing efforts, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nOur e-commerce channel has been critical to our growth, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control. There are certain critical risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce and mobile websites and digital marketing efforts, including: changes in required technology interfaces; website downtime and other technical failures, internet connectivity issues, costs and technical issues as we upgrade our website software, computer viruses, vendor reliability, changes in applicable federal and state regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") and other state privacy laws, related compliance costs, and security breaches. We must keep up to date with competitive technology trends and opportunities that are emerging throughout the retail environment, including the use of new or improved technology, evolving creative user interfaces, and other e-commerce marketing trends as the proliferation of mobile usage. While we have operational safeguards in place and endeavor to predict and invest in technology that is most relevant and beneficial to our company, our initiatives may not prove to be successful, may increase our costs, or may not succeed in driving sales or attracting customers. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales or margin in our e-commerce business, require us to impair certain assets, and damage our reputation and brands.\nOur marketing programs, e-commerce initiatives and use of consumer information are governed by an evolving set of laws and enforcement trends and unfavorable changes in those laws or trends, or our failure to comply with existing or future laws, could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nThe successful operation of our online business as well as our ability to provide a positive shopping experience at our brick-and-mortar stores depend on efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order-taking and fulfillment operations as well as the success of our marketing programs. In furtherance thereof, we collect, maintain and use data provided to us through our online activities and other customer interactions in our business. Our current and future marketing programs depend on our ability to collect, maintain and use this information, and our ability to do so is subject to certain contractual restrictions in third-party contracts as well as evolving international, federal and state laws and enforcement trends. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the U.S. regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data.\nLikewise, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI-DSS\u201d) which is mandated by the card brands and administered through the Payment Card industry Security Standards Council. Failure to meet requirements and maintain compliance could result in a loss of credibility or reputation, and our inability to continue to accept credit cards as a tender type materially impacting our ability to sell our products.\nFailure to comply with these standards could lead to recurring and accumulating fines and we may need to make significant investments to strengthen our PCI controls should we ever be deemed to be non-compliant.\nWe strive to comply with all applicable laws and other related legal obligations. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, may conflict with other rules or may conflict with our practices. If so, we may suffer damage to our reputation and be subject to proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts to defend our practices, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business and result in monetary liability, all of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nUnanticipated impacts to Halloween and seasonal sales for our retail business may adversely impact operating results.\nOur retail business realizes a significant portion of its revenues, net income and cash flows from holiday selling seasons, in particular, Halloween, as well as, New Year's Eve, Valentine\u2019s Day, Easter, Christmas and from major celebratory seasons, such as graduation. In anticipation of increased seasonal sales activity, we incur certain significant incremental expenses prior to and during peak selling seasons, including costs associated with hiring a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement our existing workforce. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products, due to COVID-19 resurgence during such periods or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. Failure to have lease suitable commercial space, on permanent or temporary bases, and adequately staff our retail stores could hurt our business, financial conditions and results of operations. For more information about how seasonality affects our results of operations, see Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur failure to appropriately respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences, including regarding licensed and single-use products, could significantly harm our customer relationships and financial performance.\nOur products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences are constantly changing. In addition to products we manufacture, we also sell certain licensed products, with images such as cartoon or motion picture characters, which are in great demand for short time periods, making it difficult to project our inventory needs for these products. We may not be able to obtain the licenses for certain popular characters and could lose market share to competitors who are able to obtain those licenses. Additionally, if consumers\u2019 demand for single-use, disposable party goods were to diminish in favor of reusable products for environmental or other reasons, our sales could decline.\nThe success of our business depends upon many factors, such as our ability to accurately predict the market for our products and our customers\u2019 purchasing habits, to identify product and merchandise trends, to innovate and develop new products, to manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner and to differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors. We may not be able to continue to offer assortments of products that appeal to our customers or respond appropriately to consumer demands. We could misinterpret or fail to identify trends on a timely basis. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer tastes could, among other things, lead to excess inventories and significant markdowns or a shortage of products and lost sales. Our failure to do so could harm our customer relationships and financial performance.\nProduct recalls and/or product liability claims may adversely impact our business, merchandise offerings, reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial performance.\nWe may be subject to product recalls if any of the products that we manufacture or sell are believed to cause injury or illness. In addition, as a retailer of products manufactured by third parties, we may also be liable for various product liability claims for products we do not manufacture. Indemnification provisions that we may enter into are typically limited by their terms and depend on the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and its insurer and the absence of significant defenses. We may be unable to obtain full recovery from the insurer or any indemnifying third party in respect of any claims against us in connection with products manufactured by such third party. Moreover, even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation and profitability. In addition, if our vendors fail to manufacture or import merchandise that adheres to our quality control standards or standards established by applicable law, our reputation and brands could be damaged, potentially leading to an increase in customer litigation against us. Furthermore, to the extent we are unable to replace any recalled products, we may have to reduce our merchandise offerings, resulting in a decrease in sales, especially if a recall occurs near or during a peak seasonal period. If our vendors are unable or unwilling to recall products failing to meet our quality standards, we may be required to recall those products at a substantial cost to us.\nOur business is sensitive to consumer spending and general economic conditions, and other factors beyond our control.\nIn general, our retail sales, and the retail sales of our business partners to whom we sell, represent discretionary spending by our customers and our business partners\u2019 customers. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, such as general business conditions, interest rates, availability of consumer credit, unemployment levels, taxation, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the flu or COVID-19, and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Our customers\u2019 purchases and our business partners\u2019 customers\u2019 purchases of discretionary items, including our products, often decline during periods when disposable income is lower or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or because of geopolitical events or widespread health emergencies. In such events, our revenues and profitability are at risk for decline. In addition, economic downturns may make it difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand trends, which could cause us to purchase excess inventories, resulting in increases in our inventory carrying cost, or insufficient inventories, resulting in our inability to satisfy our customer demand and potential loss of market share.\nMoreover, our business is susceptible to extreme weather conditions like hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, or significant snow events, and customer demand, consumer traffic, and shopping habits may become negatively impacted for periods extending beyond the individualized weather event itself. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, or other disruptive geo-political events, could also result in increases in fuel (or other energy) prices or a fuel shortage, the temporary or permanent closure of one or more of manufacturing or distribution centers, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas vendors, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas or delays in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores or to third parties who purchase from us. In addition, broader term changes in climate could cause significant changes in weather patterns where we do business and an increase in the frequency and severity of such extreme weather conditions. Public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur business could be harmed if our existing franchisees do not conduct their business in accordance with agreed upon standards.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the ability of our franchisees to operate their stores and promote and develop our store concept. Although our franchise agreements include certain operating standards, all franchisees operate independently and their employees are not our employees. We provide certain training and support to our franchisees, but the quality of franchise store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and\nrequirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. If they do not, our image, brand and reputation could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain and Third Parties\nOur business is dependent on maintaining an appropriate source of raw materials and disruption to the transportation system or increases in the costs of raw materials or transportation may negatively affect our operating results.\nThe costs of our key raw materials (by way of example, paper or petroleum-based resin) fluctuate. In general, we absorb movements in raw material costs that we consider temporary or insignificant. However, costs that we determine to not be temporary or insignificant may require that we increase prices to customers in an attempt to offset such cost increases. A significant increase in the price of raw materials that we cannot pass on to customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial performance.\nMoreover, because we rely heavily on our own manufacturing operations and those of our vendors, disruptions at manufacturing facilities in the United States or abroad, for any reason, including regulatory requirements, unstable labor relations, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the flu or COVID-19, the loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war or other forces of nature, could disrupt our supply of products, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial performance.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the loss or actions of our third-party vendors.\nOur ability to find new qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner can be a significant challenge, especially for goods sourced from outside the United States. Many of our vendors currently provide us with incentives such as volume purchasing allowances and trade discounts. If our vendors were to reduce or discontinue these incentives, costs would increase.\nFurther, we rely on our vendors\u2019 representations of product quality, safety and compliance with applicable laws and standards. If our vendors violate our agreements, applicable laws or regulations, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results. Further, concerns regarding the safety and quality of products provided by our vendors could cause our customers to avoid purchasing those products from us, or avoid purchasing products from us altogether, even if the basis for the concern is outside our control. As such, any issue, or perceived issue, regarding the quality and safety of any items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation, operations and financial results.\nWe also are unable to predict whether any of the countries in which our vendors\u2019 products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to new, different, or additional trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments or the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from vendors with international manufacturing operations, including the imposition of additional import restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds or increased tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to our customers and materially adversely affect our financial performance as well as our reputation and brand. Furthermore, some or all of our vendors\u2019 foreign operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, restrictions on the transfer of funds or other trade disruptions.\nIn addition, our business with foreign vendors, particularly with respect to our international sites, may be affected by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. For example, any movement by any other foreign currency against the U.S. dollar may result in higher costs to us for those goods. Declines in foreign currencies and currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of one or more of our foreign vendors. This, in turn, might cause such foreign vendors to demand higher prices for merchandise in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation, delay merchandise shipments, or discontinue selling to us altogether, any of which could ultimately reduce our sales or increase our\ncosts.\nWe source certain products in several foreign countries, including contracting with manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States. The labor, manufacturing safety and other practices followed by the manufacturers of these products may differ from those generally accepted in the United States as well as those with which we are required to comply under many of our image or character licenses. Although we require each of our vendors to sign a vendor agreement that requires adherence to accepted labor practices and compliance with labor, manufacturing safety and other laws and we test merchandise for product safety standards, we do not supervise, or control our vendors or the manufacturers that produce the merchandise we sell to our customers.\nMoreover, we operate in a highly regulated environment in the U.S. and elsewhere. U.S. federal, state, and local governmental entities, and foreign governments regulate many aspects of our business, including products and the importation and exportation of thereof, and these laws and regulations can change frequently. The steps we take to comply with these laws and policies or regulations do not ensure that we will comply in the future.\nWe depend on foreign vendors for timely and effective sourcing of our merchandise, and we may not be able to acquire products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable prices to meet our needs, which would impact our operations and financial results.\nOur performance depends, in part, on our ability to purchase our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We purchase our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers. We generally have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could change the terms upon which it sells to us, discontinue selling to us, or go out of business at any time. We may not be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us.\nAny inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of one or more of our foreign vendors or third-party agents could have a negative effect on our business and operating results because we would be missing products that we felt were important to our assortment, unless and until alternative supply arrangements are secured. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors or third-party agents, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and/or more expensive than those we currently purchase.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain risks that could limit our vendors\u2019 ability to provide us with quality merchandise on a timely basis and at prices that are commercially acceptable, including risks related to the availability of raw materials, labor disputes, work disruptions or stoppages, union organizing activities, vendor financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, public health issues, general economic and political conditions and regulations to address climate change.\nInformation Security Risks\nOur information systems, order fulfillment and distribution facilities may prove inadequate or may be disrupted.\nWe depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business. We will be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand our systems. We believe our perpetual inventory, automated replenishment and stock ledger systems are necessary to properly forecast, manage and analyze our inventory levels, margins and merchandise ordering quantities. We may fail to properly optimize the effectiveness of these systems, or to adequately support and maintain the systems. Moreover, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to our customers and might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary investments in technology needs and to compete with our competitors, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial performance.\nIn addition, we may not be able to prevent a significant interruption in the operation of our electronic order entry and information systems, e-commerce platforms or manufacturing and distribution facilities due to natural disasters, accidents, systems failures or other events. Any significant interruption in the operation of these facilities, including an interruption caused by our failure to successfully expand or upgrade our systems or manage our\ntransition to utilizing the expansions or upgrades, could reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores, third-party stores, and other customers, which could result in lost sales, cancelled sales and a loss of loyalty to our brand.\nWe may fail to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information.\nWe have become increasingly centralized and dependent upon automated information technology processes. In addition, a portion of our business operations is conducted over the internet. We could experience operational problems with our information systems and e-commerce platforms because of system failures, viruses, computer hackers or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed, which could-especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during a peak sales season-result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and cause our sales to decline.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store certain personal information from individuals, such as our customers and vendors, and our employees, and we process customer payment card and check information, including via our e-commerce platforms. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system, payment card terminals or other payment systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal information, payment card or check information or confidential Company business information. In particular, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any person who circumvents our security measures could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. In addition, an employee, contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Any failure to maintain the security of our customers\u2019 confidential information, or data belonging to us or our vendors, could put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in deterioration in our customers\u2019 confidence in us, subject us to potential litigation and liability, and fines and penalties, resulting in a possible material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial performance. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer a criminal attack in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner.\nESG Risks\nOur aspirations, goals and disclosures related to ESG matters, to the extent undertaken, will expose us to numerous risks, including risks to our reputation and stock price.\nIn response to evolving consumer and investor sentiment around ESG, we may establish goals which address ESG matters, and establish new and more robust disclosures associated therewith. In furtherance of such goals, we may determine that material investments in machinery or technology are necessary. We may update the mix of products which we offer to sell to consumers, or we may make commitments to waste reductions which increase costs until efficiencies can be realized. Such goals may not be received positively by consumers and our ability to achieve any goal or objective, including with respect to environmental and diversity initiatives, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. We may not be able to achieve our ESG goals within the timelines we establish for those goals or at all.\nFailure to implement ESG practices successfully, achieve our related goals, or to focus on goals that are not perceived to be valuable to consumers, regulators, or investors, could damage our reputation, causing our investors or consumers to lose confidence in us and our brands, and negatively impact our operations. We could also incur additional significant costs and require additional resources to implement ESG practices in furtherance of our ESG goals and to report regarding any progress made by the Company with respect to such ESG goals related to environmental matters.\nTalent acquisition and retention could involve increases to labor costs and if we are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, which depend in part on factors outside of our control, our operating results could suffer.\nAs our business expands, we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel who are able to successfully meet the needs of our business. Although we generally have been able to meet our staffing requirements in the past, our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as unemployment levels, labor market conditions, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. Recently, various legislative movements have sought to increase the federal minimum wage in the United States, as well as the minimum wage in several individual states.\nAs federal or state minimum wage rates increase, or as labor market conditions require, we may need to increase the wage rates of our minimum wage employee and our other hourly employees. Our inability to meet our staffing requirements in the future at costs that are favorable to us, or at all, could impair our ability to increase revenue, and our customers could experience lower levels of customer service. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including wage and hour laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to minimum wage increases, other changes to employment and healthcare laws may increase our operating expenses. These increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial and competitive position.\nOur future performance may depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, including store personnel and field management. If we are unable to do so, our ability to meet our operating goals may be compromised. If we are for any reason unable to maintain appropriate controls on store operations due to turnover or other reasons, our sales and operating margins may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel we need in the future\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our business.\nWe hold a variety of United States trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, and registrations and applications therefor, as well as several foreign counterparts thereto and/or independent foreign intellectual property asset registrations. In some cases, we rely solely on unregistered common law trademark rights and unregistered copyrights under applicable United States law to distinguish and/or protect our products, services and branding from the products, services and branding of our competitors. If our intellectual property rights are successfully challenged, we could be forced to re-brand, re-design or discontinue the sale of certain of our products or services, which could result in loss of brand recognition and/or sales and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new branding or re-designing our products. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our intellectual property rights, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce these rights. We also permit our franchisees to use several of our trademarks and service marks, including Party City and Halloween City. Our failure to properly control our franchisees\u2019 use of such trademarks could adversely affect our ability to enforce them against third parties. A loss of any of our material intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe license from many third parties and do not own the intellectual property rights necessary to sell all products capturing many popular images, such as cartoon or motion picture characters. While none of these licenses is individually material to our aggregate business, a large portion of our business depends on the continued ability to license the intellectual property rights to these images in the aggregate and on the marketplace demand for these licensed properties, which could in turn lead to a decrease in licensed costume sales.\nWe also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, which could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease using certain intellectual property rights, redesign\ncertain products or packaging or cease selling certain products or services, result in our being required to pay significant damages or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the rights to use third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, which royalty or licensing agreements may not be available at all, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness and lease obligations could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position and we may not be able to generate or distribute sufficient cash to service all our indebtedness.\nOur subsidiaries own substantially all our assets and conduct substantially all our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, we had $84,181 loans and notes payable, $1,373 current long-term obligations and $1,351,189 long-term obligations outstanding, respectively. Refer to Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11, Loans and Notes Payable and Note 12, Long-Term Obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have a substantial level of indebtedness (through our subsidiaries), and such level of debt may adversely impact our operations, financial results and increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. For example, it could:\n\u2022Make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness which could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such other indebtedness;\n\u2022Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, selling and marketing efforts, product development and other purposes;\n\u2022Increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022Expose us to the risk of increasing rates as certain of our borrowings, including under the ABL Facility and Senior Secured First Lien Floating Rate Notes due 2025, are at variable interest rates;\n\u2022Restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other corporate purposes.\nMoreover, our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance such obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The credit facilities and the indentures governing the senior notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and the proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nFurther, as discussed in detail in Note 11 - Loans and Notes Payable of Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data, our unrestricted subsidiaries under the Senior Secured First Lien Notes, the ABL Facility credit agreement and the indenture governing the Senior Secured First Lien Floating Rate Notes are not subject to the covenants under such agreements and do not guarantee or pledge assets to secure the same and the creditors of Anagram Holdings and Anagram International (together, the \u201cAnagram Issuers\u201d) and their subsidiaries will\ngenerally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of the Anagram Issuers and their subsidiaries before those assets would be available for distribution to us.\nWe and/or any of these subsidiaries could become insolvent or be restricted from making dividends in the future due to compliance with these restrictions from our debt or otherwise, and therefore we be unable to service our indebtedness.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe may require additional capital to fund our business, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all.\nWe currently rely on cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities to meet our working capital needs. However, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or if borrowings available under the credit facilities are insufficient, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives to raise cash, such as incurring additional indebtedness, selling our assets, seeking to raise additional equity capital or restructuring, which alternatives may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSignificant interest rate changes could affect our profitability and financial performance.\nOur earnings are affected by changes in interest rates because of our variable rate indebtedness under the Senior Secured First Lien Notes and the ABL Facility. The interest rate swap agreements that we use to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates (if any) may not be able to fully eliminate our exposure to these changes.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile over the past several years and could decline in the future, resulting in losses for investors.\nRegular fluctuations in our operating results, changes in investor or analyst perception of our business risks and conditions of our business, our ability to meet or exceed earnings estimates, general market volatility, or the occurrence of any one or more of the events highlighted in these risk factors may impact the price of our common stock. A significant drop in the price of our stock would expose the company to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, adversely affecting our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022the sole ability of the board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors;\n\u2022the required approval of holders of at least 75% of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of the directors to remove directors only for cause;\n\u2022the required approval of holders of at least 662\u20443% of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws, or amend or repeal certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and take action by written consent; and\n\u2022provisions that reproduce much of the provisions that limit the ability of \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d from engaging in specified business combinations with us absent prior approval of the board of directors or holders of 662\u20443% of our voting stock.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in the acquisition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in laws, policies, or regulations related to taxes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations associated with taxation requirements, including changes in applicable income tax rates, new tax laws, and revised tax law interpretations, may go through changes which are detrimental to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In light of recent and potential future changes to the corporate income tax rate and corporate taxation more generally, we continually examine the long-term impact of tax changes at the federal and state levels to our business and results of operations. See Note 12 -- Long-Term Obligations and Note 17 - Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. There are uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of U.S. tax laws and it is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our interpretations and assumptions. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may face risks associated with litigation and claims.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in other legal proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, including but not limited to, employee-related and consumer matters. Additionally, as a retailer and manufacturer of decorated party goods, we have been and may continue to be subject to product liability claims if the use of our products, whether manufactured by us or third party manufacturers, is alleged to have resulted in injury or if our products include inadequate instructions or warnings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on all claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the results of any current or future litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15327, "SIC": 2670, "TIC": "PRTY"}
