{"cik": "1040896", "company": "Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred principally losses since inception and losses may continue, which could result in a decline in the value of our securities and a loss of your investment.\nWe sustained net losses of $5,734,681 and $5,333,951 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and our accumulated deficit was $104,368,426 as of December 31, 2016. Since we expect to incur additional expenditures in line with the sales growth of our business, we may not achieve operating profits in the near future. This could lead to a decline in the value of our securities.\nOur proprietary software relies on reference data provided by government and quasi-government agencies. If these governmental and quasi-government agencies were to stop sharing data with us, the utility of our proprietary software would be diminished in those jurisdictions and our business would be damaged.\nCurrently, the fifty states, ten Canadian provinces and the District of Columbia, in most instances, conform to the guidelines established by certain organizations responsible for implementing industry standards, cooperate with us by providing sample identification cards so that we may modify all our hardware and software products to read and analyze the encoded information found on such jurisdiction\u2019s identification cards. If one or more of these jurisdictions do not continue to provide this reference data, the utility of our proprietary software may be diminished in those jurisdictions.\nOur business strategy exposes us to long sales and implementation cycles for our products.\nOur target customers in the commercial fraud protection, access control and age verification industry sectors include large retailers and government agencies, which typically require longer sales and implementation cycles for our products than do our potential customer base solely interested in age verification, such as restaurant, bar and convenience store operators. The longer sales and implementation cycles for larger retail companies continue to have an adverse impact on the timing of realizing our revenues. In addition, budgetary constraints and potential economic slowdowns may also continue to delay purchasing decisions by these prospective customers. These initiatives have costs associated with them, and we cannot assure you that they ultimately will prove successful, or result in, an increase to our revenues or profitability.\nIn addition, the loss or significant reduction in government spending by government entities could materially limit our ability to obtain government contracts. These limitations, if significant, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we will need to develop additional strategic relationships with large government contractors to successfully compete for government contracts. Should we lose or fail to develop these strategic relationships we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nThe industry for our systems and software is evolving and its growth is uncertain.\nDemand as well as industry acceptance for recently introduced and existing systems, and software and sales from such systems and software, are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. With changing administration in government, changes in government budgets, and slowly evolving government standards on use of identity products, the government sector is slowly developing. The commercial sector can develop faster than the government sector, but it is also subject to a higher level of uncertainty because of potential uncertainty in the continued financial health of our commercial customers, as well as long sales cycles. Our business may suffer if the industry develops more slowly than anticipated and does not sustain industry acceptance.\nFailure to manage our operations if they expand could impair our future growth.\nIf we can expand our operations, particularly through multiple sales to large retailers and government agencies in the document verification industry, the expansion will place significant strain on our management, financial controls, operating systems, personnel and other resources. Our ability to manage future growth, should it occur, will depend upon several factors, including our ability to do the following:\n\u25cf build and train our sales force;\n\u25cf establish and maintain relationships with distributors;\n\u25cf develop customer support systems;\n\u25cf develop expanded internal management and financial controls adequate to keep pace with growth in personnel and sales, if they occur; and\n\u25cf manage the use of third-party manufacturers and suppliers.\nIf we can grow our business but do not manage our growth successfully, we may experience increased operating expenses, loss of customers, distributors or suppliers and declining or slowed growth of revenues.\nFailure to protect our proprietary technology may impair our competitive position.\nWe continue to allocate significant resources to developing new and innovative technologies that are utilized in our products and systems. Because our continued success depends on, to a significant degree, our ability to offer products providing superior functionality and performance over those offered by our competitors, we consider the protection of our technology from unauthorized use to be fundamental to our success. This is done by processes aimed at identifying and seeking appropriate protection for newly-developed intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as policies aimed at identifying unauthorized use of such property. These processes include:\n\u25cf contractual arrangements providing for nondisclosure of proprietary information;\n\u25cf maintaining and enforcing issued patents and filing patent applications on innovative solutions to commercially important problems;\n\u25cf protecting trade secrets;\n\u25cf protecting copyrights and trademarks by registration and other appropriate means;\n\u25cf establishing internal processes for identifying and appropriately protecting new and innovative technologies; and\n\u25cf establishing practices for identifying unauthorized use of intellectual property.\nWe are currently involved in two lawsuits as a plaintiff to enforce our patent rights. Litigation can be very costly and divert management\u2019s attention. An adverse outcome in any litigation may have a severe negative effect on our financial results. To determine the priority of inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or oppositions in foreign patent and trademark offices, which could result in substantial cost and limitations on the scope or validity of our patents or trademarks.\nAdditionally, third parties, including our competitors or licensees, may seek to have our patents reviewed by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent and Trademark Office in a post grant proceeding, such as post grant review or an inter parties review. Such proceedings, if instituted could cancel our patents or narrow the scope of our patent claims. We cannot predict the effect that such proceedings, if instituted, may have on our business or revenue received from licensing our patents.\nIn addition, foreign laws treat the protection of proprietary rights differently from laws in the United States. The failure of foreign laws or judicial systems to adequately protect our proprietary rights or intellectual property, including intellectual property developed on our behalf by foreign contractors or subcontractors, may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results.\nIf our future products incorporate technologies that infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, and we do not secure licenses from them, we could be liable for substantial damages.\nWe are not aware that our current products infringe the intellectual property rights of any third parties. We also are not aware of any third party intellectual property rights that may hamper our ability to provide future products and services. However, we recognize that the development of our services or products may require that we acquire intellectual property licenses from third parties to avoid infringement of those parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. These licenses may not be available at all or may only be available on terms that are not commercially reasonable. If third parties make infringement claims against us whether or not they are upheld, such claims could:\n\u25cf consume substantial time and financial resources;\n\u25cf divert the attention of management from growing our business and managing operations; and\n\u25cf disrupt product sales and shipments.\nIf any third party prevails in an action against us for infringement of its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay damages and either enter into costly licensing arrangements or redesign our products so as to exclude any infringing use. As a result, we would incur substantial costs, delays in product development, sales and shipments, and our revenues may decline substantially. Additionally, we may not be able to achieve the minimum necessary growth for our continued success.\nFailure to attract and retain management and other personnel may damage our operations and financial results and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe depend, to a significant degree, on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key management, technical, finance, sales and other personnel. Our failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain existing or additional personnel could disrupt or otherwise harm our operations and financial results. We do not carry key man life insurance policies covering any employees. The loss of services of certain of our key employees, an inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring additional personnel could delay the development of our business and could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur share price may be volatile and could decline substantially\nThe market price of our common stock, like the price of shares of technology companies generally, has been and may continue to be volatile. From January 1, 2002 to March 29, 2017, the closing price of our common stock has varied from a high of $140.00 to a low of $0.82 per share, as reported on the NYSE MKT. Many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline, including:\n\u25cf shortfalls in revenues, cash flows or continued losses from operations;\n\u25cf delays in development or roll-out of any of our products;\n\u25cf announcements by one or more competitors of new product acquisitions or technological innovations; and\n\u25cf unfavorable outcomes from outstanding litigation.\nIn addition, the stock market experiences extreme fluctuations in price and volume that particularly affect the market price of shares of technology companies, such as ours. These price and volume fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. Because of this volatility, we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts and our stock price could decline as a result. Declines in our stock price for any reason, as well as broad-based market fluctuations or fluctuations related to our financial results or other developments, may adversely affect your ability to sell your shares at a price equal to or above the price at which you purchased them. Decreases in the price of our common stock may also lead to de-listing of our common stock.\nWe incur significant accounting and other control costs that impact our financial condition.\nAs a publicly traded corporation, we incur certain costs to comply with regulatory requirements. If regulatory requirements were to become more stringent or if controls thought to be effective later fail, we may be forced to make additional expenditures, the amounts of which could be material. Some of our competitors are privately owned, so their accounting and control costs could create a competitive advantage over us. Should our sales decline or if we are unsuccessful at increasing prices to cover higher expenditures for internal controls and audits, our costs associated with regulatory compliance will rise as a percentage of sales.\nSecuring government contracts typically involves a lengthy competitive bidding process. Often, unsuccessful bidders have the ability to challenge contract awards. Such challenges may increase costs, result in delays and risk the loss of the contract by the winning bidder. Protests or other delays related to material government contracts that may be awarded to us could result in revenue volatility. State and local government agency contracts may depend on the availability of matching funds from federal, state or local entities. State and local government agencies are subject to political, budgetary, purchasing and delivery constraints that may result in irregular revenue and operating results. Revenue volatility makes management of our business difficult. Outright loss of any material government contract through the protest process or otherwise, could significantly reduce our revenues.\nWe could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. government.\nWe, like other government contractors, are subject to various routine audits, reviews and investigations by U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and various agency inspectors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. Any costs found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government.\nOur business strategy exposes us to long sales and implementation cycles for our products.\nHistorically, some of our primary target customers have been government agencies and branches of the U.S. military, both of which require long sales and implementation cycles for products, which may result in a long period of time prior to revenue realization. The loss or significant reduction in government spending could limit our ability to obtain government contracts. These limitations, if significant, could significantly reduce our revenues. We will need to develop additional strategic relationships with large government contractors in order to successfully compete for government contracts. Should we lose or fail to develop these strategic relationships, we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nWe cannot be certain that our backlog estimates will result in actual revenues in any particular fiscal period because our clients may modify or terminate projects or may decide not to exercise contract options.\nOur backlog represents sales value of firm orders for products and services not yet delivered and, for long-term, executed contractual arrangements (contracts, subcontract and customer commitments), the estimated future sales value of product shipments, transactions processed and services to be provided over the term of the contractual arrangements, including anticipated renewal options. For contracts with indefinite quantities, our backlog is estimated based on current activity levels. Our backlog includes estimates of revenues, the receipt of which require future government appropriations, depend on option exercise by clients or are subject to contract modification or termination. At December 31, 2016, our backlog approximated $133,000. These estimates are based on our experience under such contracts and similar contracts, and we believe that such estimates are reasonable. If we do not realize a substantial amount of our backlog, as we presently anticipate, our operations could be harmed and future revenues could be significantly reduced.\nLong lead times for the components used in certain products creates uncertainty in our supply chain and may prevent us from making required deliveries to our customers on time.\nWe rely exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf technology in manufacturing our products. The lead-time for ordering certain components used in our products and for the production of products can be lengthy. As a result, we must, from time to time, order products based on forecasted demand. If demand for products lags significantly behind forecasts, we may purchase more product than we can sell. Conversely, if demand exceeds forecasts, we may not have enough products to meet our obligations to our customers.\nWe obtain certain hardware and services, as well as some software applications, from a limited group of suppliers, and our reliance on these suppliers involves significant risks, including reduced control over quality and delivery schedules.\nAny financial instability of our suppliers could result in having to find new suppliers. We may experience significant delays in manufacturing and deliveries of products and services to customers if we lose our sources or if supplies and services delivered from these sources are delayed. As a result, we may be required to incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative supply sources. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if required. We cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain replacement hardware within the required time frames at affordable costs, or at all. Any delays resulting from suppliers failing to deliver hardware or delays in obtaining alternative hardware, in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality, or any significant increase in the cost of hardware from existing or alternative suppliers could result in delays on the shipment of product which, in turn, could result in the loss of customers we may not be able to successfully complete.\nOur Defense ID\u00ae system relies on access to databases run by various government agencies. If these governmental agencies were to stop sharing data with us, the utility of the Defense ID system would be diminished and business would be damaged.\nCurrently, our Defense ID\u00ae system accesses over 100 separate databases run by various government and law enforcement agencies. We cannot be assured that each of these agencies will continue to cooperate with us. In the event that one or more of these agencies does not continue to provide access to these databases, the utility of the Defense ID\u00ae system may be diminished and, as a result, our sales could suffer.\nOur Defense ID\u00ae system requires permission from each branch of the U.S. military in the form of an Authority to Operate (ATO). If an existing ATO is revoked, we would risk losing our ability to install our Defense ID\u00ae system at military bases.\nIt is our current understanding that our Defense ID\u00ae system requires authority to operate at each Defense Department installation. There are, however, several views within the Defense Department pertaining to authorizations and accreditations required for information technology systems. We continue to work with the Defense Department to clarify these requirements that generate uncertainty for Defense Department contractors.\nAuthority to operate is granted to each installation and requires the installation to expend resources in the authorization process. The time required for this process can be lengthy, given resource availability.\nWe cannot be assured that Defense Department installations will have the resources necessary to pursue their respective authorities to operate, or that the authority to operate can be granted in a timely manner. The results of this may include loss or delay of projected Defense ID sales.\nOur Defense ID\u00ae system manages private personal information and information related to sensitive government functions and a breach of the security systems protecting such information may result in a loss of suppliers or customers or result in litigation.\nThe protective security measures designed to protect sensitive information and contained in our products may not prevent all security breaches. Failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our business, damage our reputation and expose us to litigation and liability. A party who is able to circumvent protective security measures used in these systems could misappropriate sensitive information or cause interruptions or otherwise damage our products, services and reputation as well as the property and privacy of customers. If unintended parties obtain sensitive data and information, or create bugs or viruses or otherwise sabotage the functionality of our products, we may receive negative publicity, incur liability to our customers or lose the confidence of our customers, any of which may cause the termination or modification of contracts. Further, our existing insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses and liabilities that may result from such events.\nIn addition, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by the occurrence of any such breaches. However, protective or remedial measures may not be available at a reasonable price or at all, or may not be entirely effective if commenced.\nFuture government regulation restricting the capture of information electronically stored on identification cards could adversely affect our business.\nThe Defense ID\u00ae system is designed to read, verify and capture information from identification cards. Currently, some jurisdictions have restrictions on what can be done with this information. Because issues of personal privacy continue to be a major topic of public policy debate, it is possible that, in the future, these or other jurisdictions may introduce similar or additional restrictions on capturing this information. Therefore, the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected industry sectors to become impractical and reduce our revenues and potential revenues.\nWe are subject to risks associated with product failure and technological flaws.\nOur products are complex and may contain undetected errors or result in failures when first introduced or when new versions are released. Despite vigorous product testing efforts and testing by current and potential customers, it is possible that errors will be found in a new product or enhancement after commercial shipments have commenced. The occurrence of product defects or errors could result in negative publicity, delays in product introduction and the diversion of resources to remedy defects and loss of or delay in industry acceptance or claims by customers against us and could cause us to incur additional costs, any one of which could adversely affect our business. Because of the risk of undetected error, we may be compelled to accept liability provisions that vary from our preferred contracting model in certain critical transactions. There is a risk that in certain contracts and circumstances we may not be successful in adequately minimizing product and related liabilities or that the protections negotiated will not ultimately be deemed enforceable.\nWe carry product liability insurance, but existing coverage may not be adequate to cover potential claims. The failure of our products to perform as promised could result in increased costs, lower margins, liquidated damage payment obligations and harm to our reputation.\nWe may not be able to keep up with rapid technological change.\nThe sectors for all our products are characterized by rapid technological advancements. Significant technological change could render existing technology obsolete. If we are unable to successfully respond to these developments, or do not respond in a cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nFuture capital requirements may require incurring debt or dilution of existing stockholders.\nAcquisition and development opportunities and other contingencies may arise, which could require us to raise additional capital or incur debt. If we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, including preferred stock, or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our then existing stockholders will be diluted.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our shares of stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for use in the operations and expansion of the business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on factors the Board of Directors deems relevant, including among others, our results of operations, financial condition and cash requirements, business prospects, and the terms of our credit facilities and other financing arrangements. Accordingly, realization of a gain on stockholders\u2019 investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our stock. There is no guarantee that our stock will appreciate in value.", "PERMNO": 87439, "SIC": 3579, "TIC": "IDN"}
