RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur operating results may fluctuate.\nOur operating results, including components of operating results such as gross margin and cost of product sales, may fluctuate from time to time, and such fluctuations could affect our stock price. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate from time to time in the future. Some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include:\n\u2022\neconomic conditions worldwide, which could affect the ability of hospitals and other customers to purchase our products and could result in a reduction in elective and non-reimbursed operative procedures;\n\u2022\nthe impact of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe impact of our restructuring activities;\n\u2022\nthe timing of significant customer orders, which tend to increase in the fourth quarter to coincide with the end of budget cycles for many hospitals;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our existing products, as well as products in development;\n\u2022\nthe timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in the rates of exchange between the U.S. dollar and other currencies of foreign countries in which we do business, such as the euro, British pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Australian dollar;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred and business lost in connection with product field correction actions or recalls;\n\u2022\npotential backorders and lost sales resulting from stoppages in production relating to product recalls or field corrective actions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the cost or decreases in the supply of raw materials, including energy and steel;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture and ship our products efficiently or in sufficient quantities to meet sales demands;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our research and development expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpenditures for major initiatives;\n\u2022\nreimbursement for our products by third-party payors such as Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers and foreign governmental health systems;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our new commercial sales representatives to obtain sales targets in a reasonable time frame;\n\u2022\npeer-reviewed publications discussing the clinical effectiveness of the products we sell;\n\u2022\ninspections of our manufacturing facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulations (Good Manufacturing Practices) which could result in Form 483 observations, warning letters, injunctions or other adverse findings from the FDA or from equivalent regulatory bodies, and corrective actions, procedural changes and other actions that we determine are necessary or appropriate to address the results of those inspections, any of which may affect production and our ability to supply our customers with our products;\n\u2022\nthe increased regulatory scrutiny of certain of our products, including products which we manufacture for others, could result in their being removed from the market; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges if future operating results of the acquired businesses are significantly less than the results anticipated at the time of the acquisitions.\nThe industry and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies.\nIn general, there is intense competition among medical device companies. We compete with established medical technology companies in many of our product areas. Competition also comes from early-stage companies that have alternative technological solutions for our primary clinical targets, as well as universities, research institutions and other non-profit entities. Many of our competitors have access to greater financial, technical, research and development, marketing, manufacturing, sales, distribution, administrative, consulting and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be more effective at developing commercial products. Our competitors may be able to gain market share by offering lower-cost products or by offering products that enjoy better reimbursement methodologies from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers and foreign governmental health systems.\nOur competitive position will depend on our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, develop new products, implement production and marketing plans, secure regulatory approval for products under development, obtain and maintain reimbursement coverage under Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurance, obtain patent protection and to produce products consistently in sufficient quantities to meet demand. We may need to develop new applications for our products to remain competitive. Technological advances by one or more of our current or future competitors or their achievement of superior reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurance could render our present or future products obsolete or uneconomical. Our future success will depend upon our ability to compete effectively against current technology as well as to\nrespond effectively to technological advances. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, purchasing decisions of our customers may be based on clinical evidence or comparative effectiveness studies and, because of our vast array of products, we might not be able to fund the studies necessary or provide the required information to compete effectively. Other companies may have more resources available to fund such studies. For example, competitors have launched and have been developing products to compete with our duraplasty products, extremity reconstruction implants, neuro critical care monitors and ultrasonic tissue ablation devices, among others.\nOur primary competitors in the neurosurgery markets are Medtronic, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, and Stryker Corporation. In addition, many of our neurosurgery product lines compete with smaller specialized companies or larger companies that do not otherwise focus on neurosurgery. Our competitors in extremity reconstruction include the DePuy/Synthes business of Johnson & Johnson, Stryker Corporation, and Zimmer Inc., as well as other major orthopedic companies that carry a full line of reconstructive products. We also compete with Wright Medical Group, Inc., Tornier, Inc. and other companies in the extremity reconstruction market category. Our competitors in the spinal implant and orthobiologics markets include Bacterin, Baxter, DePuy Synthes Spine, a Johnson & Johnson company, Biomet, Inc., Globus Medical, Medtronic, NuVasive, K2M, LDR, Orthofix, RTI Surgical, Stryker and Zimmer and several smaller, biologically focused companies. In surgical instruments, we compete with the Aesculap division of B. Braun Medical, Inc., as well as V. Mueller, a division of C.R. Bard. In addition, we compete with Symmetry Surgical and many smaller instrument companies in the reusable and disposable specialty instruments markets. Our private-label products face diverse and broad competition, depending on the market addressed by the product. Finally, in certain cases our products compete primarily against medical practices that treat a condition without using a device or any particular product, such as the medical practices that use autograft tissue instead of our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products and nerve repair products.\nOur plan to separate our Spine business into a separate, independent medical technology company is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all.\nOn November 3, 2014, we announced a plan to separate our Spine business into a separate, independent public company. The separation which is expected to be completed before September 2015, is subject to board approval of the final terms of the separation and certain other customary conditions, including confirmation of the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the effectiveness of a registration statement that will be filed with the SEC.\nUnanticipated developments, including both the Spine and legacy businesses\u2019 ability to respond to the changes in its end markets that could affect demand for those companies\u2019 products, changes in business relationships with customers or their purchases from each company, each company's ability to resolve any manufacturing issues that could disrupt its ability to timely deliver products to customers, possible delays in obtaining necessary tax opinions, regulatory approvals or clearances, uncertainty of the financial markets and executing the separation, could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected. We expect that the process of completing the proposed separation will be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate and may not yield a discernible benefit if the separation is not completed. In addition, in order to complete the proposed separation in a timely manner, we could agree to provide significant transition services that could further increase our costs and distract us from operating our business. Executing the proposed separation will require significant time and attention from our senior management and key employees, which could distract them from operating our business, disrupt operations and result in the loss of business opportunities, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating key employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion, which could harm our businesses.\nThe proposed separation of the Spine business may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.\nEven if the proposed separation of the Spine business is completed, we may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational, marketing or other benefits from the spin-off, including each company\u2019s ability to benefit from the new focus or to achieve anticipated growth rates, margins and scale and to execute on its strategy generally. As separate, independent, publicly traded companies, each of the two companies will be smaller with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect their respective business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.\nOur current strategy involves growth through acquisitions, which requires us to incur substantial costs and potential liabilities for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits.\nIn addition to internally generated growth, our current strategy involves growth through acquisitions. Between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014, we have acquired 4 businesses at a total cost of approximately $349.3 million.\nWe may be unable to continue to implement our growth strategy, and our strategy ultimately may be unsuccessful. A significant portion of our growth in revenues has resulted from, and is expected to continue to result from, the acquisition of businesses complementary to our own. We engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and are in various stages of discussion regarding possible acquisitions, certain of which, if consummated, could be significant to us. Any new acquisition could result in material transaction expenses, increased interest and amortization expense, increased depreciation expense, increased operating expense, and possible in-process research and development charges for acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a \u201cbusiness,\u201d any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Certain businesses that we acquire may not have adequate financial, disclosure, regulatory, quality or other compliance controls at the time we acquire them. As we grow by acquisition, we must manage and integrate the new businesses to bring them into our systems for financial, disclosure, compliance, regulatory and quality control, realize economies of scale, and control costs. In addition, acquisitions involve other risks, including diversion of management resources otherwise available for development of our business and risks associated with entering markets in which our marketing teams and sales force has limited experience or where experienced distribution alliances are not available. Our future profitability will depend in part upon our ability to develop further our resources to adapt to these new products or business areas and to identify and enter into or maintain satisfactory distribution networks. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future, obtain acceptable financing or consummate any future acquisitions. If we cannot integrate acquired operations, manage the cost of providing our products or price our products appropriately, our profitability could suffer. In addition, as a result of our acquisitions of other healthcare businesses, we may be subject to the risk of unanticipated business uncertainties, regulatory and other compliance matters or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not indemnify us, for which we may not be able to obtain insurance (or adequate insurance), or for which the indemnification may not be sufficient to cover the ultimate liabilities.\nOur future financial results could be adversely affected by impairments or other charges.\nSince we have grown through acquisitions, we have $363.9 million of goodwill and $50.1 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2014. Under the authoritative guidance for determining the useful life of intangible assets, we are required to test both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach, rather than amortizing them over time. We are also required to test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs such as a significant decline in revenues or cash flows for certain products, or the discount rates used in the calculations of discounted cash flow change significantly, or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. If such a decline, rate change or circumstance were to materialize, we may record an impairment of these intangible assets that could be material to the financial statements. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d of this report.\nThe guidance on long-lived assets requires that we assess the impairment of our long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as measured by the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. As of December 31, 2014, we had $589.6 million of finite-lived intangible assets.\nAt December 31, 2014 our trade names have a carrying value of $77.2 million and decisions relating to our trade names may occur over time. Additionally, we may discontinue certain products in the future as we continue to assess the profitability of our product lines. As a result, we may need to record impairment charges or accelerate amortization on certain trade names or technology-related intangible assets in the future.\nThe value of a medical device business is often volatile, and the assumptions underlying our estimates made in connection with our assessments under the guidance may change as a result of that volatility or other factors outside our control and may result in impairment charges. The amount of any such impairment charges could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, including the notes and the common stock into which they may be converted.\nThe adoption of healthcare reform in the United States and initiatives sponsored by other governments may adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nOur operations may be substantially affected by potential fundamental changes in the political, economic and regulatory landscape of the healthcare industry. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs are continuing in the U.S., and in many other countries where we do business, causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments. These initiatives include price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements.\nIn March 2010, significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). The Affordable Care Act includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose new\nand/or increased taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform by implementing a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by a manufacturer, producer or importer of such devices in the United States. Because the substantial majority of our revenues is generated in the United States, the Affordable Care Act has affected our financial results since it came into effect after December 31, 2012.\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act also requires detailed disclosure of gifts and other remuneration made to healthcare professionals, which may have a negative impact on our relationships with customers and ability to seek input on product design or involvement in research.\nOther provisions of the Affordable Care Act could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered in the United States, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThere are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood, and it is unclear what the full impact of the legislation will be. We cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the U.S. federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States or elsewhere. That said, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to monitor the implementation of such legislation and, to the extent new market or industry trends or new governmental programs evolve, we will have implemented or will consider implementing programs to respond.\nInitiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in other markets where we do business.\nFurther, the Affordable Care Act encourages hospitals and physicians to work collaboratively through shared savings programs, such as accountable care organizations, as well as other bundled payment initiatives, which may ultimately result in the reduction of medical device purchases and the consolidation of medical device suppliers used by hospitals.\nChanges in the healthcare industry may require us to decrease the selling price for our products, may reduce the size of the market for our products, or may eliminate a market, any of which could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nTrends toward managed care, healthcare cost containment and other changes in government and private sector initiatives in the United States and other countries in which we do business are placing increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies that could adversely affect the sale and/or the prices of our products. For example:\n\u2022\nas mentioned above, the Affordable Care Act, which is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time, has resulted in and will continue to result in major changes in the United States healthcare system that have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, including a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of most medical devices, implemented in 2013, which has adversely affected our earnings;\n\u2022\nthird-party payors of hospital services and hospital outpatient services, including Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers and foreign governmental health systems, annually revise their payment methodologies, which can result in stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital charges for certain medical procedures or the elimination of reimbursement;\n\u2022\nforeign governmental health systems have revised, and continue to consider whether to revise, their payment methodologies, which have resulted and could continue to result in stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital charges for certain medical procedures leading to less government reimbursement, thereby putting downward pricing pressure on our products or rendering some uneconomical;\n\u2022\nMedicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurer and foreign governmental cutbacks could create downward price pressure on our products;\n\u2022\nin the United States, local Medicare coverage as well as commercial carrier coverage determinations will reduce or eliminate reimbursement or coverage for certain of our wound matrix products as well as other collagen products in most regions, negatively affecting our market for these products, and future determinations could reduce or eliminate reimbursement or coverage for these products in other regions and could reduce or eliminate reimbursement or coverage for other products;\n\u2022\nthere has been a consolidation among healthcare facilities and purchasers of medical devices in the United States, some of whom prefer to limit the number of suppliers from whom they purchase medical products, and these entities may decide to stop purchasing our products or demand discounts on our prices;\n\u2022\nthere has been a growing movement of physicians becoming employees of hospitals and other healthcare entities, which aligns surgeon product choices with his or her employers' purchasing decisions, and adds to pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nin the United States, we are party to contracts with group purchasing organizations, which negotiate pricing for many member hospitals, that require us to discount our prices for certain of our products and limit our ability to raise prices for certain of our products, particularly surgical instruments;\n\u2022\nthere is economic pressure to contain healthcare costs in domestic and international markets, and, regardless of the consolidation discussed above, providers generally are exploring ways to cut costs by eliminating purchases or driving reductions in the prices that they pay for medical devices;\n\u2022\nthere are proposed and existing laws, regulations and industry policies in domestic and international markets regulating the sales and marketing practices and the pricing and profitability of companies in the healthcare industry;\n\u2022\nproposed laws or regulations will permit hospitals to provide financial incentives to doctors for reducing hospital costs (known as gainsharing), will award physician efficiency (known as physician profiling), and will encourage partnerships with healthcare service and goods providers to reduce prices;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence of physician-owned distributorships catering to the spinal surgery market has reduced and may continue to reduce our ability to compete effectively for business from surgeons who own such distributorships; and\n\u2022\nthere have been initiatives by third-party payors and foreign governmental health systems to challenge the prices charged for medical products that could affect our ability to sell products on a competitive basis.\nAny and all of the above factors could materially and adversely affect our levels of revenue and our profitability.\nWe are subject to stringent domestic and foreign medical device regulation and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our medical devices. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies for new products, or for enhancements or modifications to existing products, could\n\u2022\ntake a significant amount of time;\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve rigorous and expensive pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products; and\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the indicated uses of our products.\nWe cannot be certain that we will receive required approval or clearance from the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis. The failure to receive approval or clearance for significant new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. For example, we are required to comply with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, which mandates that manufacturers of medical devices adhere to certain quality assurance requirements pertaining to, among other things, validation of manufacturing processes, controls for purchasing product components, and documentation practices. As another example, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulation requires us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, that a malfunction occurred which would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury upon recurrence. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA, which may result in observations on Form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize such medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.\nThe FDA has been increasing its scrutiny of the medical device industry and the government is expected to continue to scrutinize the industry closely with inspections, and possibly enforcement actions, by the FDA or other agencies. Additionally, the FDA may restrict manufacturing and impose other operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products. In addition, negative publicity and product liability claims resulting from any adverse regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have an outstanding FDA warning letter related to our Andover, England facility (\u201cAndover Facility\u201d). On April 25, 2014, we received a letter from the FDA stating that while it accepted the Corrective Action Plan for the Andover Facility, the warning letter would not be closed out until the FDA conducted an inspection of the Andover facility and concluded that the violations\nstated in the FDA warning letter had been addressed. On December 31, 2014, we closed the Andover Facility and delisted it as an FDA registered facility.\nWhile we have taken measures to enhance our Quality System and are no longer operating under warning letters, we cannot assure you that future inspections by FDA and the standards they apply will not result in a warning letter for any facility in the future.\nThe FDA Safety and Innovation Act (\"FDASIA\"), which includes the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 (\"MDUFA III\"), as well as other medical device provisions, went into effect October 1, 2012. This includes performance goals and user fees paid to the FDA by medical device companies when they register and list with the FDA and when they submit an application to market a device in the U.S. This will affect the fees paid to the FDA over the five-year period that FDASIA is in effect. As part of FDASIA, there are additional requirements regarding FDA Establishment Registration and Listing of Medical Devices. All U.S. and foreign manufacturers must register and list medical devices for sale in the U.S. All of our facilities comply with these requirements. That said, we also source products from foreign contract manufacturers. From this business practice, it is possible that some of our foreign contract manufacturers will not comply with these requirements and choose not to register with the FDA. In such an event, we will need to determine if there are alternative foreign contract manufacturers who comply with the FDA Establishment Registration requirements. If such a foreign contract manufacturer is a sole supplier of one of our products, there is a risk that we may not be able to source another supplier.\nThe FDA issued a final rule on September 24, 2013 to establish a system to adequately identify devices through distribution and use. This rule requires the label of medical devices to include a unique device identifier (\u201cUDI\u201d), except where the rule provides for an exception or alternative placement. The labeler must submit product information concerning devices to FDA's Global Unique Device Identification Database (\"GUDID\"), unless subject to an exception or alternative. The system established by this rule requires the label and device package of each medical device to include a UDI and requires that each UDI be provided in a plain-text version and in a form that uses automatic identification and data capture technology. If the device is intended to be used more than once and intended to be reprocessed before each use, then there is a requirement for the UDI to be directly marked on the device itself. This regulation will require significant resources and expense to comply with the regulation. We have complied with the initial requirements of this regulation for our Class III products by meeting the September 2014 deadline for labeling and entering the data in FDA's GUDID Database.\nIn addition, some of our orthobiologics products are subject to FDA and certain state regulations regarding human cells, tissues, and cellular or tissue-based products, which include requirements for Establishment Registration and listing, donor eligibility, current good tissue practices, labeling, adverse-event reporting, and inspection and enforcement. Some states have their own tissue banking regulation. We are licensed or have permits as a tissue bank in California, Florida, New York and Maryland. In addition, tissue banks may undergo voluntary accreditation by the AATB. The AATB has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become a licensed tissue bank.\nFinally, the FDA issued regulations regarding \u201cCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Combination Products\u201d on January 22, 2013. These regulations apply to some of our product lines that have been designated by the FDA as Combination Products. There have been and will be additional costs associated with compliance with the FDA Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements regulations for Combination Products.\nWe manufacture medical devices that are subject to various electrical safety standards. Many countries have adopted the recommendations of the International Electrotechnical Commission (\u201cIEC\u201d) for the safety and effectiveness of medical electrical equipment. The IEC is a non-profit, non-governmental international standards organization that prepares and publishes International Standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies. Their updated standards were implemented in some markets starting in July 2012 and have continued to be adopted over the following years worldwide. If we cannot comply with these standards, we may not be able to sell some of our products in the affected markets. Most of our affected products have already been modified to meet these standards and are substantially in compliance with these standards. Except in limited circumstances, we do not anticipate any delays in selling our products in the markets that have adopted the IEC updated standards.\nIn addition, the FDCA permits device manufacturers to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for \u201coff-label\u201d uses, including actions alleging that federal health care program reimbursement of products promoted for \"off-label\" uses are false and fraudulent claims to the government. The failure to comply with \u201coff-label\u201d promotion restrictions can result in significant financial penalties and a required corporate integrity agreement with the federal government imposing significant administrative obligations and costs, and potential evaluation from federal health care programs.\nForeign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to even more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for a company's noncompliance with\nforeign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company's business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental medical device law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations.\nCertain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.\nCertain of our products, including our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products, biomaterial products for the spine, nerve and tendon repair products and certain other products, contain material derived from bovine tissue. In 2014 approximately 23% of our revenues were attributable to products containing material derived from bovine tissue. Products that contain materials derived from animal sources, including food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, are subject to scrutiny in the media and by regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities are concerned about the potential for the transmission of disease from animals to humans via those materials. This public scrutiny has been particularly acute in Japan and Western Europe with respect to products derived from animal sources, because of concern that materials infected with the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy, otherwise known as BSE or mad cow disease, may, if ingested or implanted, cause a variant of the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, an ultimately fatal disease with no known cure. Cases of BSE in cattle discovered in Canada and the United States have increased awareness of the issue in North America. In 2013, the World Organization for Animal Health (\"OIE\") recommended that the United States risk classification for BSE be upgraded from controlled risk to negligible risk.\nWe take care to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease. In particular, we have qualified a source of collagen from a country outside the United States that is considered BSE-free. The World Health Organization classifies different types of cattle tissue for relative risk of BSE transmission. Deep flexor tendon is in the lowest-risk categories for BSE transmission (the same category as milk, for example), and is therefore considered to have a negligible risk of containing the agent that causes BSE (an improperly folded protein known as a prion). Nevertheless, products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, could become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for the transmission of prions. Significant new regulation, or a ban of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our current business or our ability to expand our business.\nCertain countries, such as Japan, China, Taiwan and Argentina, have issued regulations that require our collagen products be processed from bovine tendon sourced from countries where no cases of BSE have occurred, and the EU has requested that our dural replacement products and other products that are used in neurological tissue be sourced from bovine tendon sourced from a country where no cases of BSE have occurred. Currently, we purchase our tendon from the United States and New Zealand. New Zealand has never had a case of BSE. We received approval in the United States, the EU, Japan, Taiwan, China, Argentina as well as other countries for the use of New Zealand-sourced tendon in the manufacturing of our products. If we cannot continue to use or qualify a source of tendon from New Zealand or another country that has never had a case of BSE, we will not be permitted to sell our collagen products in certain countries.\nCertain of our products are derived from human tissue and are subject to additional regulations and requirements.\nWe manufacture medical devices derived from human tissue (demineralized bone tissue). The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. Examples include bone, ligament, skin and cornea.\nSome HCT/Ps also meet the definition of a biological product, medical device or drug regulated under the FD&C Act. Section 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as \u201c361\u201d HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, Good Tissue Practice, or GTP, when processing, storing, labeling, and distribution HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping; and adverse event reporting. These biologic, device or drug HCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to 361 HCT/Ps and, in addition, with requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs, including premarket clearance or approval.\nThe AATB has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become a licensed tissue bank. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. We are licensed or have permits as a tissue bank in California, Florida, New York and Maryland.\nIn addition, procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the NOTA, which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks for their expenses associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue that they provide to us for processing. We include in our pricing structure amounts paid to tissue banks to reimburse them for their expenses associated with the recovery and transportation of the tissue, in addition to certain costs associated with processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the tissue, marketing and medical education expenses, and costs associated with development of tissue processing technologies. NOTA payment allowances may be interpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we can recover in our pricing for our products, thereby reducing our future revenue and\nprofitability. If we were to be found to have violated NOTA\u2019s prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable consideration, we would potentially be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn the EU, regulations, if applicable, differ from one EU member state to the next. Because of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in the EU, as well as for other countries, the approval process for human derived cell or tissue based medical products could be extensive, lengthy, expensive, and unpredictable. Among others, some of our orthobiologics products are subject to EU member states\u2019 regulations that govern the donation, procurement, testing, coding, traceability, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells and cellular or tissue-based products. These EU member states\u2019 regulations include requirements for registration, listing, labeling, adverse-event reporting, and inspection and enforcement. Some EU member states have their own tissue banking regulations.\nLack of market acceptance for our products or market preference for technologies that compete with our products could reduce our revenues and profitability.\nWe cannot be certain that our current products or any other products that we develop or market will achieve or maintain market acceptance. Certain of the medical indications that our devices can treat can also be treated by other medical devices or by medical practices that do not include a device. The medical community widely accepts many alternative treatments, and certain of these other treatments have a long history of use. For example, the use of autograft tissue is a well-established means for repairing the dermis, and it competes for acceptance in the market with our collagen-based wound care products.\nWe cannot be certain that our new devices and procedures will be able to replace those established treatments or that physicians, the medical community or third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers and foreign governmental health systems, will accept and utilize our devices or any other medical products that we may develop. For example, greater market acceptance of our wound graft products may ultimately depend on our ability to demonstrate that higher rates of reimbursement are justified because they are an attractive and cost-effective alternative to other treatment options. Additionally, if there are negative events in the industry, whether real or perceived, there could be a negative impact on the industry as a whole. For example, we believe that some in the medical community have lingering concerns over the risk of disease transmission through the use of natural bone graft substitutes.\nIn addition, our future success depends, in part, on our ability to license and develop additional products. Even if we determine that a product candidate has medical benefits, the cost of commercializing that product candidate, either through internal development or payments associated with licensing arrangements, could be too high to justify development. Competitors could develop products that are more effective, achieve or maintain more favorable reimbursement status from third-party payors both domestically and internationally, including Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers, and foreign governmental health systems, cost less or are ready for commercial introduction before our products. If we are unable to develop additional commercially viable products, our future prospects could be adversely affected.\nMarket acceptance of our products depends on many factors, including our ability to convince prospective collaborators and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other technologies, to manufacture products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs, and to supply and service sufficient quantities of our products directly or through our distribution alliances. In addition, unfavorable reimbursement methodologies, or adverse determinations of third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers, and foreign governmental health systems, regarding our products or third-party determinations that favor a competitor\u2019s product over ours, could harm acceptance or continued use of our products. The industry is subject to rapid and continuous change arising from, among other things, consolidation, technological improvements, the pressure on governments, third-party payors and providers to reduce healthcare costs, and healthcare reform legislation and initiatives domestically and internationally. One or more of these factors may vary unpredictably, and such variations could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. We may not be able to adjust our contemplated plan of development to meet changing market demands.\nCurrent economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of hospitals, other customers, suppliers and distributors to access funds or otherwise have available liquidity, which could reduce orders for our products or interrupt our production or distribution or result in a reduction in elective and non-reimbursed operative procedures.\nCurrent economic conditions, especially in Europe, may adversely affect the ability of hospitals and other customers to access funds to enable them to fund their operating and capital budgets. As a result, hospitals and other customers may reduce budgets or put all or part of their budgets on hold or close their operations, which could have a negative effect on our sales, particularly the sales of capital equipment such as our ultrasonic surgical aspirators, neuromonitors and stereotactic products, or result in a reduction in elective and non-reimbursed procedures. Governmental austerity policies in Europe and other markets have reduced and could continue to reduce the amount of money available to purchase medical products, including our products.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nThe Company\u2019s 2016 Notes (hereinafter defined) mature in December 2016. On July 2, 2014, the Company entered into its third amended and restated credit agreement, as amended on December 19, 2014 (hereinafter defined as the \"2014 Amendment\"). As of February 23, 2015, we had approximately $401.9 million of outstanding borrowings under these two financing arrangements. The Company may attempt to refinance or extend, either or both of these obligations depending on prevailing market conditions. Our ability to refinance or extend these obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Any disruptions in our operations, the financial markets, or overall economy may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nIt could be difficult to replace some of our suppliers.\nOutside vendors, some of whom are sole-source suppliers, provide key components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. Although we believe that alternative sources for many of these components and raw materials are available, any interruption in supply of a limited or sole-source component or raw material could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new or alternative source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier\u2019s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could harm our ability to manufacture products. We may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired. We believe that these factors are most likely to affect the following products that we manufacture:\n\u2022\nour collagen-based products, such as the Integra\u00ae Dermal Regeneration Template and wound matrix products, the DuraGen\u00ae family of products, and our Absorbable Collagen Sponges;\n\u2022\nour products made from silicone, such as our neurosurgical shunts and drainage systems and hemodynamic shunts;\n\u2022\nproducts which use many different specialty parts from numerous suppliers, such as our intracranial monitors and catheters; and\n\u2022\nproducts that use pyrolytic carbon (i.e., PyroCarbon) technology, such as certain of our reconstructive extremity orthopedic implants.\nIn addition, some of our orthobiologics products rely on a small number of tissue banks accredited by the AATB, for the supply of human tissue, a crucial component of our bone graft substitutes. We cannot be certain that these tissue banks will be able to fulfill our requirements or that we will be able to successfully negotiate with other accredited tissue facilities on satisfactory terms.\nIn connection with our Confluent Surgical acquisition in January 2014, we entered into a multi-year supply agreement with an affiliate of the seller to continue to manufacture the acquired surgical sealant and adhesion barrier product lines.\nIf we were suddenly unable to purchase products from one or more of these companies, we would need a significant period of time to qualify a replacement, and the production of any affected products could be disrupted.\nWhile it is our policy to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time, we remain at risk that we will not be able to qualify new components or materials quickly enough to prevent a disruption if one or more of our suppliers ceases production of important components or materials.\nOur intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our products, potentially enabling third parties to use our technology or very similar technology and could reduce our ability to compete in the market.\nTo compete effectively, we depend, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and manufacturing processes, which includes the ability to obtain, protect and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets. We own or have licensed patents that cover aspects of some of our product lines. Our patents, however, may not provide us with any significant competitive advantage. Others may challenge our patents and, as a result, our patents could be narrowed, invalidated or rendered unenforceable. Competitors may develop products similar to ours that our patents do not cover. In addition, our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the United States or foreign countries. Further, there is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years.\nOur competitive position depends, in part, upon unpatented trade secrets which we may be unable to protect.\nOur competitive position also depends upon unpatented trade secrets, which are difficult to protect. We cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, that our trade secrets will not be disclosed or that we can effectively protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets.\nIn an effort to protect our trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements\nprovide that, except in specified circumstances, all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of their relationship with us must be kept confidential. We cannot assure you, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of the unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information.\nOur success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others.\nWe may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we may find it necessary, if threatened, to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration from a court that we do not infringe the proprietary rights of others or that their rights are invalid or unenforceable. If we do not prevail in any litigation, in addition to any damages we might have to pay, we would be required to stop the infringing activity (which could include a cessation of selling the products in question) or obtain a license for the proprietary rights involved. Any required license may be unavailable to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive and allow our competitors to access the same technology we license.\nIf we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design our products so as not to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, we may be unable to sell some of our products, and this potential inability could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits relating to our intellectual property rights and promotional practices, which may be expensive.\nTo protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may have to initiate or defend legal proceedings, such as infringement suits or opposition proceedings, against or by third parties. In addition, we may have to institute proceedings regarding our competitors\u2019 promotional practices or defend proceedings regarding our promotional practices. Legal proceedings are costly, and, even if we prevail, the cost of the legal proceedings could affect our profitability. In addition, litigation is time-consuming and could divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Moreover, in response to our claims against other parties, those parties could assert counterclaims against us.\nIf any of our manufacturing facilities were damaged and/or our manufacturing or business processes interrupted, we could experience lost revenues and our business could be seriously harmed.\nDamage to our manufacturing, development or research facilities because of fire, extreme weather conditions, natural disaster, power loss, communications failure, unauthorized entry or other events, such as a flu or other health epidemic, could cause us to cease development and manufacturing of some or all of our products. In particular, our San Diego and Irvine, California facilities are susceptible to earthquake damage, wildfire damage and power losses from electrical shortages as are other businesses in Southern California. Our A\u00f1asco, Puerto Rico plant, where we manufacture collagen, silicone and our private-label products, is vulnerable to hurricane, storm, earthquake and wind damage. Our Plainsboro, New Jersey facility is vulnerable to hurricane damage. Although we maintain property damage and business interruption insurance coverage on these facilities, our insurance might not cover all losses under such circumstances, and we may not be able to renew or obtain such insurance in the future on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at reasonable costs.\nIn addition, certain of our surgical instruments have some manufacturing processes performed by third parties in Pakistan, which is subject to political instability and unrest, and we purchase a much smaller amount of instruments directly from vendors there. Such instability could interrupt our ability to sell surgical instruments to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. While we have developed a relationship with an alternative provider of these services in another country, and continue to work to develop other providers in other countries, we cannot guarantee that we will be completely successful in establishing all of these relationships. Even if we are successful in establishing all of these alternative relationships, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so at the same level of costs or that we will be able to pass along additional costs to our customers.\nFurther, we manufacture certain products in Europe and our European headquarters is located in France, which has experienced labor strikes. Thus far, strikes have not had a material impact on our business; however, if such strikes were to occur, there is no assurance that they would not disrupt our business, and any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn experienced third party hosts and maintains the enterprise business system used to support certain of our transaction processing for accounting and financial reporting, supply chain and manufacturing. Currently, we have developed a comprehensive disaster recovery plan for the Company\u2019s infrastructure. As we have not fully tested the plan, we have adopted alternative solutions to mitigate business risk, including backup equipment, power and communications. We also implemented a comprehensive backup and recovery process for our key software applications. Our global production and distribution operations are dependent on the effective management of information flow between facilities. An interruption of the support provided by our enterprise business systems could have a material adverse effect on the business.\nWe may experience difficulties, delays, performance impact or unexpected costs from consolidation of facilities.\nWe consolidated several facilities in 2014, and may further consolidate our operations in the future in order to improve our cost structure, achieve increased operating efficiencies, and improve our competitive standing or results of operations and/or to\naddress unfavorable economic conditions. As part of these initiatives, we may also lose favorable tax incentives or not be able to renew leases on acceptable terms. We may further reduce staff, make changes to certain capital projects, close certain production operations and abandon leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our operations. In conjunction with any actions, we will continue to make significant investments and build the framework for our future growth. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from these efforts because of unforeseen difficulties, delays, implementation issues or unexpected costs. If we are unable to achieve or maintain all of the resulting savings or benefits to our business or other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks relating to our international sales and operations, including fluctuations in exchange rates, local economic conditions and delays in collection of accounts receivable.\nWe generate significant revenues outside the United States in multiple foreign currencies including euros, British pounds, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, and Australian dollars, and in U.S. dollar-denominated transactions conducted with customers who generate revenue in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For those foreign customers who purchase our products in U.S. dollars, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which those customers do business may have a negative impact on the demand for our products in foreign countries where the U.S. dollar has increased in value compared to the local currency.\nSince we have operations based outside the United States and we generate revenues and incur operating expenses in multiple foreign currencies including euros, British pounds, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, and Australian dollars, we experience currency exchange risk with respect to those foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses. Our most significant currency exchange risk relates to transactions conducted in euros, Canadian dollars, and Australian dollars.\nWe cannot predict the consolidated effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective. For a description of our use of derivative financial instruments, see Note 5, \u201cDerivative Instruments\u201d in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur international operations subject us to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs, import-export, laws regarding transactions in foreign countries, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery and other laws regarding interactions with healthcare professionals, and product registration requirements. Among other things, these laws restrict, and in some cases prevent, U.S. companies from directly or indirectly selling goods, technology or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in structuring our sales and marketing practices and effecting product registrations in foreign countries.\nLocal economic conditions, legal, regulatory or political considerations, disruptions from strikes, the effectiveness of our sales representatives and distributors, local competition, in-country reimbursement methodologies and changes in local medical practice could also affect our sales to foreign markets. Relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country, often with longer-term receivables than are typical in the United States.\nOversight of the medical device industry might affect the manner in which we may sell medical devices and compete in the marketplace.\nThere are laws and regulations that govern the means by which companies in the healthcare industry may market their products to healthcare professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their products, including for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, state law equivalents to these federal laws that are meant to protect against fraud and abuse and analogous laws in foreign countries. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, in some instances civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Although we exercise care in structuring our sales and marketing practices and customer discount arrangements to comply with those laws and regulations, we cannot assure that:\n\u2022\ngovernment officials charged with responsibility for enforcing those laws will not assert that our sales and marketing practices or customer discount arrangements are in violation of those laws or regulations; or\n\u2022\ngovernment regulators or courts will interpret those laws or regulations in a manner consistent with our interpretation.\nCorrespondingly, federal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation, and from time to time we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage if our interpretation differs from that of our competitors. AdvaMed (U.S.), EucoMed (Europe), MEDEC (Canada), and MTAA (Australia), some of the principal trade associations for the medical device industry, promulgate model codes of ethics that set forth standards by which its members should (and non-member companies may) abide in the promotion of their products; AdvaMed is undergoing initiatives in Latin America and Asia Pacific to develop regional codes of ethics there as well. We have in place policies and procedures for compliance that we believe are at least as stringent as those set\nforth in the revised AdvaMed Code, and we regularly train our sales and marketing personnel on our policies regarding sales and marketing practices. Pursuant to the revised AdvaMed Code, we have certified our adoption of the revised AdvaMed Code. Nevertheless, the sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from federal and state government agencies, and we believe that this trend will continue. For example, federal legislation, state legislation and foreign legislation requires detailed disclosure of gifts and other remuneration made to healthcare professionals. In addition, prosecutorial scrutiny over the past several years and governmental oversight, on the state and federal levels, over some major device companies regarding the retention of healthcare professionals as consultants has limited the manner in which medical device companies may retain healthcare professionals as consultants. Various hospital organizations, medical societies and trade associations are establishing their own practices that may require detailed disclosures of relationships between healthcare professionals and medical device companies or ban or restrict certain marketing and sales practices such as gifts and business meals.\nOur private-label product lines depend significantly on key relationships with third parties, which we could be unable to establish and maintain.\nOur private-label business depends in part on our entering into and maintaining collaborative or alliance agreements with third parties concerning product marketing, as well as research and development programs. The third parties with whom we have entered into agreements might terminate these agreements for a variety of reasons, including developing other sources for the products that we supply. Termination of our most important relationships could adversely affect our expectations for the growth of private-label products.\nWe may have significant product liability exposure and our insurance may not cover all potential claims.\nWe are exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that our technologies or products are alleged to have caused harm. We may not be able to obtain insurance for the potential liability on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at reasonable costs. Any potential product liability claims could exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. Our insurance may not be renewed at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that then in effect.\nWe are subject to requirements relating to hazardous materials which may impose significant compliance or other costs on us.\nOur research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. In addition, we own and/or lease a number of facilities at which hazardous materials have been used in the past. Finally, we have acquired various companies that historically have used certain hazardous materials and that have owned and/or leased facilities at which hazardous materials have been used. For all of these reasons, we are subject to federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, treatment, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials and certain waste products (\u201cEnvironmental Laws\u201d). For example, our allograft bone tissue processing may generate waste materials, which in the United States, are classified as medical waste under Environmental Laws. Although we believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials comply with the Environmental Laws, the Environmental Laws may be amended in ways that increase our cost of compliance, perhaps materially.\nFurthermore, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated, and there is also a risk that such contamination previously has occurred in connection with one of our facilities or in connection with one of the companies we have purchased. In the event of such an accident or contamination, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any related liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance and could exceed our resources. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system.\nWe are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system to improve our operational efficiency. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial reporting data and provide information to our management team important to the operation of the business. Our ERP system has required, and will require, the investment of significant human and financial resources. The implementation of this ERP involves numerous risks, including disruption to our normal accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting, inaccuracies in the conversion of electronic data, difficulties integrating the systems and processes, additional costs to continue to refine the system\u2019s functionality, and disruption of our financial reporting process. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP without experiencing significant delays, increased costs, or other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design or implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to estimate supply chain needs, plan production requirements, process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, accurately forecast sales, or otherwise operate our business, all of which could negatively impact sales and profits. Even though a significant portion of the Company is running on our new ERP system as of December 31, 2014, we will continue to face similar risks in implementing our ERP system within the remaining sites as we continue to maintain multiple legacy ERP systems.\nWe are dependent on information technology and if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, our business could be materially affected.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our infrastructure and to support business decisions. As a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems, as well as any data breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, third parties may attempt to breach our systems and may obtain data relating to patients, the Company\u2019s proprietary information, or other sensitive data. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, suffer backlash from negative public relations, have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nOn August 22, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals (i.e., tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold) known as conflict minerals, if these conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of our products. These regulations require such companies to report annually whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold used in the manufacture of medical devices, including our products. In addition, we may incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant conflict minerals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, the due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to determine the origins for these conflict minerals or determine that these conflict minerals are DRC conflict-free, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying any customers who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict-free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and result in a loss of revenue. These requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.", "PERMNO": 82179, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "IART"}
