{"cik": "1491778", "company": "Angie's List, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following risks and the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and future prospects. These risks are not the only risks facing us as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may become important factors that may materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks or uncertainties, and you may lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nWe incurred annual net losses in the past, and we may incur additional net losses as we implement our business strategies.\nAside from 2015, we have incurred annual net losses each year since inception. As a result, our accumulated deficit was $262.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Consequently, we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings. Key elements of our business strategies often include growing and strengthening our membership and service provider bases, increasing traffic to and engagement across our platforms and increasing revenue from service providers. We anticipate our expenses will continue to increase as we, among other things, expand our member and service provider bases, develop new marketing initiatives, incentivize consumers to interact and transact on our platforms, enhance our technology platform and launch new products and services. These planned investments may result in additional net losses or negative cash flow impacts. Further, if our revenue does not grow or declines, or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, we may not become profitable on a sustained basis, or at all, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur inability to develop, execute and evolve our business strategies may adversely impact future results.\nOur ability to successfully develop, execute and evolve our business strategies could require significant capital investment and management attention, which might result in the diversion of these resources from other business initiatives or opportunities. Additionally, any new or modified initiative is subject to risks, including market acceptance, competition, product differentiation, challenges to scale in our marketplace and the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There can be no assurance we will be able to successfully develop, execute and evolve our business strategies, and if we ultimately are unable to successfully do so, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe encountered, and may continue to encounter, difficulties related to the implementation of our new technology platform.\nWe began implementing our new technology platform, AL 4.0, in a limited number of markets in the fourth quarter of 2015, followed by a nationwide rollout during the first half of 2016. We encountered difficulties migrating to our new technology platform and, accordingly, experienced delays in implementing certain new products and services. We incurred costs to address the issues identified and also experienced revenue losses associated with non-renewal of service provider contracts and paid membership subscriptions, as well as declines in e-commerce unit sales, as a result of disruptions attributable to our new technology platform. If we encounter more issues as we add additional functionalities and introduce upgrades and enhancements to the platform, our reputation and overall business performance could be damaged. Further, our business operations and relationships will continue to be at risk if the new platform does not meet our performance expectations, or those of our users, which could harm our business in numerous ways, including, without limitation, losses of revenue, memberships or service provider contracts or damage to our reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial condition or operating results.\nWe are exploring strategic alternatives, but there can be no assurance we will be successful in identifying or implementing any strategic alternative or that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for stockholders.\nWe have commenced a review of strategic alternatives which could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination, asset divestiture, partnership or other collaboration agreements, or potential acquisitions or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions, or a continuance of existing operations under our current business plan and strategy or under new business plans or strategies. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. In addition, we could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives, including those related to employee retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, which could negatively impact our profitability. The public announcement of strategic alternatives may also yield a negative impact on sales if prospective or existing service providers are reluctant to commit to new or renewal contracts, if existing members decide not to renew or upgrade their memberships or to purchase e-commerce offers or consumers decide not to become members. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations, and there is a risk that our current employees will leave as a result of uncertainties related to our exploration of strategic alternatives. If we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. We also cannot be certain that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than is reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to increase our service provider revenue as our membership grows and our membership packaging, pricing and monetization strategies evolve.\nTypically, we are able to charge higher rates for advertising when service providers are able to reach a larger base of potential customers. However, as we generally only adjust advertising rates at the time of contract renewal, growth in service provider revenue commonly trails increases in membership. Accordingly, growth of our membership base may not result in service provider revenue increases until future periods, if at all. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with the credit quality of our service providers, and our business could suffer if service providers to which we provide advertising and e-commerce services are unable to meet their contractual obligations to us. Further, as our business evolves and membership packaging, pricing and monetization strategies change, any resulting declines in membership revenue may not be offset by concurrent increases in service provider revenue. Ultimately, if we are unable to increase our service provider revenue as our business strategies evolve, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we fail to attract, retain or deepen our relationships with service providers, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed.\nFor 2016 and 2015, we derived 82% and 80%, respectively, of our revenue from service providers, and we expect to continue to generate an increasing portion of our revenue from service providers in the future. Our ability to attract, retain and deepen our relationships with service providers and, ultimately, to generate revenue from service providers depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing the number of memberships in our markets;\n\u2022\nmaintaining high levels of member and service provider engagement;\n\u2022\nenticing members to engage and transact via our e-commerce marketplace;\n\u2022\ncompeting effectively for advertising dollars with other online and offline advertising providers;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to enhance our advertising and e-commerce packaging and pricing strategies; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping new products and services that are attractive to both members and service providers.\nWe offer both offline and online advertising products as well as an array of e-commerce opportunities to certified service providers, and our business depends, in part, on service providers\u2019 willingness to actively participate in the various initiatives we offer, including advertising on our platforms. Service providers may choose not to advertise or engage in e-commerce with us or may leave us for competing alternatives upon expiration or termination of their agreements with us. Failure to demonstrate the value of our products and services to service providers could result in reduced spending by, or loss of, existing or potential future participating service providers, which could materially harm our business, revenue or financial condition.\nWe generally do not employ local \u201cfeet on the street\u201d sales personnel to sell advertising or pitch e-commerce to service providers and instead rely on call center sales personnel. The resulting lack of a personal connection with service providers may impede us in growing or maintaining service provider revenue. As we expand our business, it will be important for us to continue to recruit, integrate and retain additional skilled and experienced sales personnel who can effectively communicate our value proposition to service providers. Accordingly, we could be adversely affected if we hire poorly or if sales personnel do not reach desired levels of effectiveness within a period of time consistent with our historical experience, thereby potentially harming our business, revenue or overall financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain high levels of member satisfaction and engagement, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely impacted.\nWe believe the success of our business strategies is contingent, in part, on our ability to provide our members with high-quality services and benefits that meet or exceed their expectations and therefore drive traffic to and engagement on our platforms. Member satisfaction and engagement may be inhibited for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour failure to develop or offer new or improved products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with our competitors and the evolving needs of our members;\n\u2022\nour inability to market our products and services in a cost-effective manner to prospective and existing members; and\n\u2022\nour failure to provide a differentiated user experience, including regular upgrades and improvements to our products, services and technology platform.\nIf we are unable to provide our members with engaging products, services and technology, we may not be able to attract new members or retain existing members, which could yield, among other things, decreases in traffic, searches, service provider profile views or the quantity or quality of member reviews submitted, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIf we are unable to sustain or improve member engagement, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed.\nAs our business matures and we achieve higher penetration rates in the markets in which we operate, the traffic across our platforms may slow over time, and potentially decrease in certain periods. Accordingly, our success may become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase member engagement. A number of factors may negatively impact member engagement, including:\n\u2022\nmember engagement with products and services on competitors\u2019 platforms;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the number, or perceived quality, of reviews contributed by our members;\n\u2022\nfailure to introduce new and improved products and services, or introduction of new products and services that do not effectively address member needs;\n\u2022\ntechnical or other problems impairing the availability or reliability of our products and services or otherwise negatively impacting the user experience; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our brand reputation or image.\nIf we are unable to sustain or improve member engagement, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to introduce new or upgraded products, services or technology that consumers and service providers recognize as valuable, we may fail to generate additional traffic to and engagement on our platforms, attract and retain members and service providers or monetize the activity on our platforms. Our efforts to develop new and upgraded products, services or technology could require us to incur significant costs.\nIn order to attract and retain members and service providers, generate consumer traffic to and engagement on our platforms and monetize such traffic and engagement via service provider advertising, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new or upgraded products, services and technology that add value for members and service providers and differentiate us from our competitors. The success of new products, services and technology depends on several factors, including our ability to effectively address consumer needs and preferences and timely completion, introduction and market acceptance. If members and service providers do not recognize the value of our new products, services or technology, they may choose not to utilize or advertise on our platforms.\nWe may experience difficulties in developing and delivering new or upgraded products, services or technology, which may increase our expenses. Moreover, we cannot be certain that new or upgraded products, services or technology will work as intended or provide value to members or service providers. Additionally, some new or upgraded products, services or technology may be complex and challenging to effectively market to prospective and existing members and may also involve additional changes to our current pricing tiers.\nWe cannot guarantee current or prospective members and service providers will respond favorably to new products, services or technology. Furthermore, there are inherent risks associated with our efforts to enhance and improve the ease of use, responsiveness, functionality and features of our existing platforms, and we may not be able to manage such enhancements and improvements successfully. We may also choose to license or otherwise integrate applications, content and data from third parties, which may impose costs on our business and require the use of our own resources. We may be unable to continue to access such applications, content or data on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, all of which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our efforts to increase memberships, retain existing paid memberships, drive traffic across our platforms or maintain high levels of member engagement are not successful, our growth prospects and revenue could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow our business and generate increased revenue depends, in part, on attracting new members, retaining our existing paid membership base and driving traffic to and high levels of engagement across our platforms. Growing our membership base and generating traffic to and engagement on our platforms will require us to continually address a number of challenges, and we may fail to do so successfully. Some of these challenges include:\n\u2022\ncontinuing to build our database of ratings and reviews of service providers;\n\u2022\nincreasing the number and variety of service providers reviewed by our members;\n\u2022\nconvincing prospective members of the benefits that can be derived from our products and services;\n\u2022\nproviding membership tiers that offer desirable benefits and levels of service at attractive price points;\n\u2022\ndelivering a compelling member experience, including relevant, high-quality discounts and deals and other promotional offers from our participating service providers; and\n\u2022\ninnovating to keep pace with changes in technology and competition.\nOur inability to grow our membership base, retain existing paid memberships or generate traffic to and high levels of engagement across our platforms could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur paid membership renewal rates and membership revenue have declined, and are likely to continue to decline, in connection with our introduction of a free membership tier during 2016, which could harm our business, financial condition or operating results.\nPrior to June 2016, we only offered paid membership tiers to consumers. Following our introduction of a free membership tier in June 2016, our paid membership base is decreasing as new members are primarily joining via our free membership offering, and existing paid members are not renewing as paid members at rates consistent with our historical averages. Our paid membership renewal rates are likely to continue to decline as a result of a number of factors, including additional pricing changes in the future, adjustments to our product or service offerings, competitive pressures or general customer satisfaction, among other things. The introduction of a free membership tier may ultimately yield reductions in our revenue if we are unable to effectively monetize our free member traffic and engagement with service provider revenue, and our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed as a result.\nWe continue to make substantial investments in membership acquisition. If the revenue generated by new memberships varies significantly from our expectations, or if our membership acquisition costs or costs associated with servicing our members increase, we may not be able to recover our membership acquisition costs or generate profits from this investment.\nWe incurred marketing expense of $65.1 million and $83.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, a portion of which was for the intended purpose of acquiring new members, in addition to generating traffic to and engagement across our platforms. We expect to continue to invest in acquiring new members and driving engagement, primarily through national advertising. Our analysis of the revenue we expect new memberships to generate depends on several estimates and assumptions, including our membership tier structure, paid membership renewal rates, future membership fees, e-commerce purchase rates and incremental advertising and e-commerce revenue from service providers driven by the growth of our membership base and increased penetration of our markets. If our estimates and assumptions regarding the revenue we can generate from new memberships prove incorrect, we may be unable to recover our membership acquisition costs or generate a return on our investment in acquiring new memberships. Moreover, if our membership acquisition costs or the costs associated with servicing our members increase, the return on our investment may be lower than we anticipate irrespective of the revenue generated by new memberships. If we cannot generate a return on this investment, our growth rate, business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on the strength of our brand, which is built on a foundation of authentic reviews and the trust of consumers, and the failure to maintain that authenticity and trust could damage our brand and harm our ability to maintain or expand our membership and service provider bases.\nTrust in the integrity of our brand and in the objective, unbiased nature of our ratings and reviews contributes significantly to our ability to attract new members and service providers. Maintaining consumer trust and enhancing our brand depends largely on our ability to maintain our commitment to and reputation for placing the interests of our members first. If existing or prospective members perceive that our focus is not member-oriented, our reputation and the strength of our brand could be adversely affected. Complaints or negative publicity about our sales and business practices, products, services and technology, personnel or customer service, irrespective of their validity, or concerns regarding data privacy and security, could diminish consumers\u2019 confidence in our service and adversely impact our brand.\nTrust in our brand could also be impaired if we are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of the ratings and reviews that appear across our platforms. While we utilize various technology-based algorithms and filters to detect fraudulent reviews, and we believe our prohibition of anonymous reviews provides a degree of traceability and accountability not present on other websites, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of our reviews. Moreover, as our membership base expands and the number of service providers rated and reviewed by our members grows, we may see an increase in fraudulent or inaccurate reviews. If fraudulent or inaccurate reviews - positive or negative - increase on our platforms, and we are unable to effectively identify and remove such reviews, the overall quality of our ratings and reviews could decrease, our reputation as a source of trusted ratings and reviews might be harmed and consumers and service providers might be deterred from using our products and services, which could negatively impact our brand, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, our brand could be harmed if any of our trademarks are used inappropriately. For example, service providers might use our trademarks without our permission, including our Super Service Award, which is available only to service providers that maintain superior service ratings. We have in the past taken, and will in the future take, action, including initiating litigation, to protect our trademarks and the integrity of our brand. If such efforts are unsuccessful, our brand and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically demonstrated, and is likely to continue to exhibit, volatility, and could decline substantially within a short period of time. For example, as of February 17, 2017, since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in November 2011 at a price of $13.00 per share, our trading price has ranged from $3.73 to $28.32. The trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the risk factors discussed herein, these factors include:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nour business strategies and related initiatives;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to our business;\n\u2022\nany change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry, changes in securities analysts\u2019 projections or recommendations, withdrawal of research coverage or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall stock market or in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to stockholder class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and therefore harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe covenants in the financing agreement limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur debt and liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nmake redemptions and repurchases of capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase debt, other than under the financing agreement;\n\u2022\nengage in acquisitions, consolidations, asset dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\nchange our business;\n\u2022\namend our material agreements;\n\u2022\nissue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nreceive distributions from subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\ngrant negative pledges to other creditors.\nThe financing agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including minimum active service provider contract value, minimum consolidated EBITDA, minimum liquidity and maximum consolidated capital expenditures, and is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and, through a delayed draw term loan facility, provides a source of liquidity to enable us to fund our current and future operations, if necessary. A breach of any of the covenants or requirements in the financing agreement could result in a default under the financing agreement, unless we are able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is not waived, and subject to any appropriate cure periods, the lenders could elect to exercise any of their available remedies, which may include the right to not lend any additional amounts to us or, in certain instances, to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay the borrowings with respect to the financing agreement when due, the lender would be permitted to proceed against our collateral. If the lender takes any or all of these steps, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted, and we may be unable to continue to fund our operations.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access to our members\u2019 or service providers\u2019 data is obtained, our service may be perceived as not being secure, and members and service providers may curtail or terminate their use of our service.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store in our data centers and networks sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our members, service providers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategies. Our service involves the storage and transmission of our members\u2019 and service providers\u2019 proprietary information, such as credit card and bank account numbers, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, resulting in potential litigation and liability. Further, our payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other fraud schemes, including unauthorized use of credit cards, debit cards or bank account information, identity theft or merchant fraud, and could result in fines by credit card companies or the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments.\nDespite the precautionary measures we have in place, we are subject to a number of risks related to intentional business disruptions, data protection breaches, piracy and other security risks, and we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and services and harm our reputation as a company. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our members\u2019 or service providers\u2019 data, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information as a result of such events could adversely affect our competitive position, reputation, brand or future sales of our products and services, and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose members and service providers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInterruptions or delays in service arising from our technology infrastructure could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe rely, in part, upon third-party co-location technology facilities and cloud-based data services vendors, including data center, online infrastructure and bandwidth, as well as payment processing vendors, none of which are under our control, to provide our products and services to our members and service providers. Our own internal facilities, as well as the external third-party technology facilities and vendors we utilize, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from tornadoes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, the failure of physical, administrative and cybersecurity measures, terrorist acts, human error, financial insolvency of third-party providers or other unanticipated problems or events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions in our service and unauthorized access to, or alteration of, the content and data contained on our systems or stored and delivered on our behalf by third-party vendors and facilities. As our technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our systems and our overall operations, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business, result in a loss of existing or potential members and service providers or increase our technology maintenance and support costs, all of which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Further, our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses that may occur as a result of any such interruptions or delays.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our systems and our overall operations. Certain aspects of our technology infrastructure run on a complex distributed system, or what is commonly known as cloud computing. We own, operate and maintain the primary elements of this system, but some elements of this system are operated by third parties we do not control and which would require significant time to replace, thereby increasing our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, interruptions and delays in service and availability for such elements. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with cloud computing technologies and information services could negatively impact our brand and reputation, our relationship with our members and service providers or our ability to attract, retain and serve our members and service providers.\nIn addition, we designed and developed key aspects of the software code and technical infrastructure for the technology platforms through which we provide our products and services, and we plan to continue to maintain and develop certain elements of our technology platforms internally. Our software code and technical infrastructure are complex, and such efforts may therefore lead to increased product and technology expense, operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products and services. These issues may not be identified immediately, which could result in further interruption, degradation or cost, thereby resulting in potential adverse impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf security measures at third parties are breached, our ability to automatically renew paid memberships or process service provider payments could be harmed.\nMany of our members and service providers shop at third parties, including retailers such as Target and Home Depot, and pay by credit card at such places. While we assume third parties adequately protect their customers\u2019 personal information, including bank account and credit card details, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to such personal information change frequently, and third parties may be unable to implement sufficient preventive measures to protect that information. If any of our members\u2019 or service providers\u2019 bank account or credit card information is compromised by a security breach at a third-party, any such members or service providers may be forced to open a new bank account or obtain a new credit card, and the payment information we have on file for those impacted members and service providers would no longer be valid, impairing our ability to automatically process paid membership renewals and service provider payments. Our inability to automatically renew paid memberships and process service provider payments may have a significant negative impact on our revenue, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed as a result.\nWe are involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time-consuming, and such matters could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims and lawsuits and regularly involved in litigation, both as a plaintiff and as a defendant, related to our business and operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for litigation in the future. Any negative outcomes from litigation in which we are involved could result in payment of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products, services or business practices, and accordingly, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Although the results of litigation and claims brought against us cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe the final outcome of such matters that we are currently facing will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, except as otherwise recorded within the consolidated financial statements. However, there can be no assurance of a favorable final outcome for all present and future legal matters, and regardless of the outcomes of present or future cases, any lawsuit can adversely impact our business due to potential defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal, potentially leading to payments of substantial damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe are and will continue to be faced with many competitive challenges, any of which could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe compete for consumer attention with numerous providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals on the basis of a number of factors, including, among other things, breadth of our service provider listings, reliability of our content, depth and timeliness of information, quality and availability of our products, services and technology and strength and recognition of our brand. We also compete for a share of service providers\u2019 overall advertising budgets with traditional, offline media companies and online marketing providers on the basis of several factors, including, among other things, return on investment, the quality of our membership profile, the effectiveness and relevance of our discount and e-commerce initiatives, our pricing and monetization strategies and recognition of our brand.\nTo compete effectively, we must continue to invest significant resources in marketing, sales and technology. Many of our competitors continue to invest in the expansion of their businesses internationally. Failure to compete effectively against our current or future competitors, domestically or internationally, could result in losses of existing or prospective paid members, current or potential participating service providers or a reduced share of our participating service providers\u2019 overall operating budgets, which could adversely affect our pricing and margins, lower our service provider revenue or prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. There is no guarantee we will be able to compete effectively in the future against existing or new competitors, and the failure to do so could result in losses of existing or potential paid memberships and participating service providers, increased marketing or selling expenses or diminished brand strength, any of which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our business strategies, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nOur business strategies have required, and may continue to require, us to utilize substantial financial, operational and technical resources, including placing significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Continued growth could strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our members and service providers. If our operations continue to grow in size, scope and complexity, it will be important for us to continue to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, and we may determine it is necessary to open additional operational locations, such as call centers, to support our advertising and e-commerce sales efforts, which could require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to maintain a necessary level of discipline and efficiency, or if we fail to allocate limited resources effectively in our organization as we implement our business strategies, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from period to period, which makes our performance difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur revenue and operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Therefore, comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed herein, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022\nour ability to retain our current paid memberships and build our overall membership base;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain participating service providers and convince them to increase their advertising spending and engagement across our platforms;\n\u2022\nour ability to drive engagement and transaction volume across our platforms;\n\u2022\nour revenue mix and any changes we make to our membership tiers and fee structure, e-commerce take rates or other sources of revenue;\n\u2022\nour marketing and selling expenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nthe effects of increased competition in our business and our ability to keep pace with our competitors\u2019 advertising spending and technology innovations;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop new products and services;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with defending any litigation or enforcing our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation affecting our business.\nSeasonal variations in the behavior of our members and service providers also may cause fluctuations in our financial results. For example, we expect to continue to experience some seasonal trends in member and service provider behavior due to decreased demand for home improvement services in winter months. In addition, advertising expenditures by service providers tend to be discretionary in nature and may be sporadic as a result of a variety of factors, including seasonality, many of which are outside our control. We also expect revenue contributions from our e-commerce offerings to fluctuate from period to period as the offerings evolve and due to seasonality. We believe our business will continue to be subject to seasonality in the future, which may result in fluctuations in our financial results from period to period.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to attract, retain and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our future success depends, in part, upon the continued service of key members of our management team as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced sales, technology and other personnel. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott A. Durchslag, and our co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer, Angie Hicks, are critical to our overall management and the development of our culture and strategic direction. In particular, the reputation, popularity and talent of Ms. Hicks are important factors in the public perception of Angie\u2019s List, and the loss of her services or any repeated or sustained shifts in public perceptions of her could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, qualified individuals are in high demand in the technology sector, and we may therefore incur significant costs to attract or retain qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel as a result. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel possess more resources than us. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the technology sector, job candidates often consider the value of the stock compensation they would receive in connection with their employment. If we are unable to attract and retain our executive officers and key employees, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives, and our business could be harmed.\nWe provide our executive officers and other key personnel with a mix of cash and equity compensation. With respect to equity compensation, prior to 2015, we only offered stock options to these parties, but during 2015, we began granting time-based and performance-based restricted stock units to these parties as well. If share-based payment awards granted to executive officers and other key personnel lose value or, in the case of stock options, are not in the money subsequent to the grant date, the viability of such share-based payment awards as a retention tool could be negatively impacted, which may make it difficult to retain these employees. If we are unable to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to operate or expand our business, and certain of our initiatives may necessitate substantial capital resources before they begin to generate revenue. Our working capital may vary, which could require us to seek additional financing. Although we believe we possess adequate working capital resources to support the execution of our business strategies, we may need additional funding to accomplish our plans. Our working capital needs are extremely difficult to predict and may continue to be extremely difficult to predict even after we have settled on a strategic course of direction. We may therefore be subject to significant and rapid increases in our working capital needs that could require us to seek additional financing sources. Additional funds may not be available when needed, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. For example, our debt facility contains various restrictive covenants with respect to the use of funds from our borrowings, and any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain capital. If we attempt to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, which could adversely affect the availability of such funds. Furthermore, volatility in the credit or equity markets may negatively impact our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, or the cost of such financing may not be favorable. If sufficient funds are not available to us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to generate or maintain high-quality reviews and reports from consumers, we may be unable to provide members with the information they seek, which could negatively impact membership and service provider retention and growth.\nOur business depends, in part, on our ability to provide our members with the information they seek, which is directly impacted by the quality and quantity of reviews and reports provided by consumers. For example, we may be unable to offer our members adequate information on service providers if content is not contributed that is helpful or relevant to a service category in a particular market or if consumers are unwilling to contribute reviews and reports due to concerns related to potential lawsuits or harassment by service providers they review, instances of which have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future. In addition, we may not be able to provide members with the information they are seeking if our site is not updated. We do not remove older reviews, and members may view these reviews as less relevant, helpful or reliable. If our platforms do not provide current information about service providers, or members perceive reviews on our site as less relevant or stale, our brand, business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nMembership growth is impacted by traffic to our website from search engines, such as Google, some of which offer products and services that compete directly with our offerings. If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our site could decline, and our business could be adversely impacted.\nA portion of our website traffic is generated by non-paid search results that appear on search engines, such as Google. While SEO has a much lower cost per acquisition as compared to many outbound marketing channels and helps reduce our overall cost per membership acquisition, our ability to maintain high organic search rankings is not completely within our control. As such, our competitors\u2019 SEO efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours. Separately, online search engines could revise their methodologies in such a way that could adversely affect our search result rankings. For example, Google makes changes to its algorithms from time to time, any one of which could potentially impact our rankings, which we are dependent upon, to a certain extent, to drive traffic to and engagement on our platforms. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of Internet users directed to our website through search engines could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf service providers rated on our website do not meet the expectations of our members, or engage in unethical or illegal conduct, we may suffer reputational harm, liability or adverse impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations as a result.\nQuality and integrity are important foundations of our business that could be harmed by actions taken by service providers outside our control. Our members utilize our platforms and tools to gather information about services that oftentimes carry a high risk of failure and also, at times, to purchase services at discounted rates through our e-commerce offerings. If such services are performed incompetently, or if service providers fail to perform prepaid services, our reputation could be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that service providers will perform to the satisfaction of our members, or at all. In addition, unethical or illegal conduct by service providers rated on our website could damage our reputation or expose us to liability arising from claims made by or on behalf of those harmed by such conduct.\nWe pay service providers for e-commerce offerings purchased by members in advance of the performance of the service. Under this payment model, service providers are paid regardless of whether the e-commerce offers are redeemed or the services are performed. We offer guarantees around price and service quality to our paid members on work performed by service providers under e-commerce transactions executed on our platforms, and, subject to certain limitations, members may request a refund from us on these e-commerce transactions. As we do not control the service providers or the quality and price of the services they deliver, we develop estimates for refund claims. Our actual level of refund claims could prove to be greater than the level of refund claims we estimate. Moreover, our members may make requests for refunds with respect to which we are unable to recover reimbursement from the applicable service providers. An increase in our refund rates, or our inability to recover from our service providers, as well as any failure of service providers rated on our website to meet the expectations of our members, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany consumers utilize mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to access our platforms. If we are not successful in developing products and services that can be efficiently and effectively utilized through mobile technologies, or such products and services are not widely adopted, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of consumers seeking information about service providers through mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, has increased significantly over the past several years and is likely to continue to grow in the future. If our members are unable to access our ratings and reviews of service providers on their mobile devices, if we otherwise fail to develop and maintain effective mobile advertising and related products and services or if our mobile products and services are not widely adopted by our members, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer. Additionally, as new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to forecast the challenges that may arise, and we may need to devote significant resources to the development, support and maintenance of these products. Finally, if we experience problems with continued integration of our mobile applications into mobile devices, if we experience issues with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores or if we face increased costs to distribute our mobile applications, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nFailure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of personal information, including personal health information, could result in liability to us, damage our reputation or harm our business.\nA variety of federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personal information. We collect and utilize demographic and other information from and about our members as they interact with our various platforms. We may also collect information from our members when they provide ratings and reviews of service providers, purchase e-commerce offers, participate in polls or contests or sign up to receive emails from us. Further, we utilize tracking technologies, including \u201ccookies,\u201d to help us manage and track our members\u2019 interactions with our platforms and deliver relevant advertising. Claims or allegations that we violated laws and regulations related to privacy and data security could in the future result in negative publicity or a loss of confidence in us by members and service providers and may subject us to government fines. In addition, we have posted privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of consumer data on our websites and mobile applications. Several Internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices.\nIn the course of rating and reviewing health care or wellness providers, our members may post personal health information about themselves or others, and the health care or wellness providers reviewed by our members may submit responses that contain private or confidential health information about those that provided the reviews or others. While we strive to comply with applicable privacy and security laws and regulations regarding personal health information, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose members or service providers, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols for personal information, including personal health information, imposed by law, regulation, self-regulatory bodies, industry standards and contractual obligations. However, such laws and regulations are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations. Also, federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current, or enact new, laws or regulations regarding privacy matters. We are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation in the area of privacy of personal information could be enacted or its effect on our operations and business. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of personal information, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to accepting credit card and debit card payments.\nWe accept payments from service providers and members primarily through credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. An increase in those fees could require us to either increase the prices we charge for our services, which could yield declines in memberships or service provider participation, or incur an increase in our operating expenses, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we, or any of our processing vendors, experience problems with our billing software, or if the billing software malfunctions, it could adversely affect our member and service provider satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if our billing software fails to work properly and, as a result, we are unable to automatically charge our members\u2019 or service providers\u2019 credit cards on a timely basis, or at all, we could lose revenue, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, a security standard with which companies that collect, store or transmit certain data related to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions are required to comply. Our failure to fully comply with the PCI DSS may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors and merchant banks. Such compliance failures may also subject us to fines, penalties, damages or civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. In addition, there is no guarantee that PCI DSS compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders or credit and debit card transactions.\nIf we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures or significantly higher credit card costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate at acceptable levels, our credit card fees for chargeback transactions or our fees for many or all categories of credit and debit card transactions, credit card companies and debit card issuers may increase our fees or terminate their relationship with us. Any increases in our credit card or debit card fees could adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise the rates for our services to offset the increase. Meanwhile, the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card could significantly impair our ability to operate our business and potentially negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs we develop and sell new products and services, we may be subject to additional and unexpected regulations, which could increase our costs or otherwise harm our business.\nAs we develop and sell new products and services, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations that could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs or restrict our operations. The application of certain laws and regulations to some of our promotions are uncertain. These include laws and regulations such as the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or the CARD Act, and unclaimed and abandoned property laws. If our promotions are subject to the CARD Act, unclaimed and abandoned property laws or any similar state law or regulation, we may be required to record liabilities with respect to unredeemed promotions, and we may be subject to additional fines and penalties.\nFrom time to time, we may also be notified of new laws and regulations, such as the Department of Labor\u2019s recent revisions to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governmental organizations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or any failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity or cause us to alter our business practices, which could cause our revenue to decrease or our costs to increase, thus harming our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain, modify and scale the network infrastructure necessary to operate our website, mobile applications and related technologies and platforms.\nOur members access reviews and other information through our website, mobile applications and related technologies and platforms. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our members and service providers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our website and mobile applications and the underlying network infrastructure. As our membership and service provider bases grow and the level of activity on our website and various related technology platforms increases, the amount of information shared across our technology infrastructure will continue to grow, and we will therefore require an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power to service our members and service providers. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology platforms, including data centers, equipment and related network infrastructure, as well as new technologies focused on driving enhanced customer experiences and business efficiencies, to support current and anticipated future growth and to effectively and efficiently handle the traffic and data flow on our website and systems. The development, expansion, operation and maintenance of our technology and network infrastructure is expensive and complex and requires significant internal and external resources. If we do not successfully develop, expand, operate or maintain our technology and network infrastructure, or if we experience operational failures, our reputation could be harmed, and we could lose current and prospective members and service providers, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully prevent other companies from misappropriating our data in the future.\nFrom time to time, third parties attempt to misappropriate our ratings and reviews and other confidential data pertaining to our service providers, markets and sales procedures through website scraping, search robots, breach of confidentiality agreements or other means. We may not be able to successfully detect and prevent all such efforts in a timely manner or be certain that no misuse of our data occurs. In addition, third parties operating \u201ccopycat\u201d websites have attempted to misappropriate data from our network and to imitate our brand and the functionality of our website. When we have identified such efforts by other companies, we have employed technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. In other circumstances, we have enforced confidentiality rights with former employees via legal actions. However, we may not be able to detect all such efforts in a timely manner, or at all, and even if we could, the technological and legal measures available to us may be insufficient. In some cases, particularly in the case of companies operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the damage to our business caused by such websites. Regardless of whether or not we can successfully enforce our rights against third parties, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant time and resources and adversely impact our brand, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions, to safeguard our intellectual property. We do not have any patents or pending patent applications. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our digital content, aspects of our solutions for members and service providers, our technology, software, branding and functionality, or obtain and use other information that we consider proprietary. Moreover, policing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 25 registered trademarks in the United States, including \u201cAngie\u2019s List,\u201d and one registered trademark in Europe, as well as four pending trademark applications in the United States. Some of our trade names may not be eligible to receive trademark protection. Trademark protection may also not be available, or sought by us, in every country in which our service may become available online. Competitors may adopt service names similar to ours or purchase our trademarks and utilize confusingly similar terms as keywords in Internet search engine advertising programs, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly confusing consumers and service providers. Moreover, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate marks similar to our trademarks. In addition, in the past, some service providers have used our trademarks inappropriately or without our permission, including our Super Service Award, which is available only to service providers that maintain superior service ratings. We have in the past taken, and may in the future take, action, including initiating litigation, to protect our intellectual property rights and the integrity of our brand, but these efforts may prove costly, ineffective or both.\nWe currently hold the \u201cAngie\u2019s List\u201d Internet domain name and various other related domain names. Domain names generally are regulated by Internet governing bodies. If we lose the ability to use a domain name in the United States or any other country, we could be forced to incur significant additional expense to market our solutions, including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials, which could substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain the domain names that utilize the \u201cAngie\u2019s List\u201d name in all of the countries in which we may conduct business in the future. Further, our digital content is not protected by any registered copyrights or other registered intellectual property and is instead protected by statutory and common law rights and by user agreements that limit access to and use of our data, and by technological measures. Compliance with use restrictions is difficult to monitor, and our proprietary rights in our digital content databases may be more difficult to enforce than other forms of intellectual property rights.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our domain names or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn order to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our personnel, consultants and third parties with whom we maintain relationships. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation of trade secrets or any unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and confidential information, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or our competitors being able to obtain our trade secrets or independently develop similar or competing technologies, could adversely affect our competitive business position and therefore harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInternet, technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. Some Internet, technology and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, any of which could be utilized to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, and as we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We cannot guarantee that we are not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights.\nAssertions of third-party intellectual property rights or any infringement or misappropriation claims arising from such assertions could substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court or are decided in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent or copyright rights, to cease making, licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others, to expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions, to enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content or materials or to indemnify our partners and other third parties. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures. Litigation related to intellectual property rights, regardless of the outcome, could be expensive to resolve and could divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome of our services and technologies may utilize \u201copen source\u201d software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we release the source code of certain services subject to those licenses.\nSome of our services and technologies may incorporate software licensed under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses, including, but not limited to, the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License. These open source licenses typically require that source code subject to the licenses be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. These open source licenses typically mandate that certain proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with open source software, is subject to the open source license. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software.\nWe take steps to ensure our proprietary software is not combined with, nor incorporates, open source software in ways that would require our proprietary software to be subject to an open source license. However, few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty. Additionally, we rely on multiple software engineers to design our proprietary technologies, and although we take steps to prevent our engineers from including open source software in the technologies and software code they design, write and modify, we do not exercise complete control over the development efforts of our software engineers, and we cannot be certain our engineers have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary products and technologies or that they will not do so in the future. In the event portions of our proprietary technology are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our services and technologies and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide software and related services necessary for the operation of our business.\nWe utilize third-party software in our product and service offerings and expect to continue to do so. The operation of our product and service offerings could be impaired if errors or defects occur in the third-party software we utilize, and it may be difficult for us to correct any such errors or defects as the development and maintenance of the software is not within our control, thereby potentially adversely affecting our business. Further, we cannot be certain that third-party licensors will continue to make their software available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, invest the appropriate levels of resources in their software to maintain and enhance its capabilities or remain in business. Any impairment in our relationships with our third-party licensors could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, third-party in-licenses may expose us to increased risk, including risks associated with the assimilation of new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. The inability to obtain these licenses could result in delays in development of solutions until equivalent technology can be identified and integrated, which could cause our business, financial condition or results of operations to suffer.\nOur revenue may be negatively affected if we are required to pay sales and use tax or other transaction taxes on all or a portion of our past and future sales in jurisdictions where we are currently not collecting and reporting tax.\nCurrently, we do not separately collect sales and use or other transaction taxes from our members. Instead, we report and, if applicable, pay sales and use and other transaction taxes on behalf of our members in certain jurisdictions and record an accrual for such taxes based on probable liability within other applicable jurisdictions. A successful assertion by any state or local jurisdiction in which we do not pay sales and use or other transaction taxes that we should be paying such taxes on the sale of our products or services, or the imposition of new laws requiring the payment of sales and use or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services, could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales, create increased administrative burdens or costs, discourage members and service providers from purchasing products or services from us, decrease our ability to compete or otherwise substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may suffer liability as a result of the ratings or reviews posted on our website.\nOur terms of use specifically require members submitting reviews to represent that their ratings and reviews are based on their actual first-hand experiences and are accurate, truthful and complete in all respects and that they possess the right and authority to grant us a license to publish their reviews. However, we do not verify the accuracy of these representations on a case-by-case basis. There is a risk that a review may be considered defamatory or otherwise offensive, objectionable or illegal under applicable law. Therefore, there is a risk that publication of ratings and reviews on our website may give rise to a suit against us for defamation, civil rights infringement, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, invasion of privacy, personal injury, product liability, breach of contract, unfair competition, discrimination, antitrust or other legal claims. From time to time, we are involved in claims and lawsuits based on the contents of the ratings and reviews posted on our website, including claims of defamation. To date, we have not suffered a material loss due to a claim of defamation. We may be subject to similar claims in the future, which could result in costly and time-consuming litigation, liability for monetary damages or injury to our reputation, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not realize the expected business benefits of our efforts to reorganize certain of our departments, and the reorganized departments could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business or adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nWe periodically make changes to the structure of various departments within our company in an effort to optimize performance, productivity or costs. Such reorganizations involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the reorganization;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in and the cost of reorganizing operations, services and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset reorganization costs;\n\u2022\nliabilities and expenses associated with the reorganization, both known and unknown; and\n\u2022\nnegative impacts due to a reduction in productivity and efficiency caused by the reorganization process.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate and execute internal reorganizations, our business may be seriously harmed, which could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders or otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our product and service offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, member and service provider demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies rather than through internal development. Our experience with respect to acquiring other businesses and technologies is limited. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses for identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. Furthermore, even if we successfully acquire additional businesses or technologies, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations or technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business or technology. In addition, we may unknowingly inherit liabilities from future acquisitions that arise after the acquisition and are not adequately covered by indemnities. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely impact our operating results or the value of our common stock. If an acquired business or technology fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $159.3 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $210.9 million. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to utilize our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may therefore suffer.\nConcentration of ownership among our officers and directors and their affiliates may limit the influence of new investors on corporate decisions.\nOur officers, directors and their affiliated funds beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, approximately 18% of our company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, if some of these persons or entities act together, they could be capable of meaningfully influencing the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may delay or preclude an acquisition or cause the market price of our stock to decline. Some of these persons or entities may have interests different from the rest of our stockholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders.\nThe actions of an activist stockholder could adversely affect our business. Specifically:\n\u2022\nresponding to common actions of an activist stockholder, such as public proposals and requests for special meetings, potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or other special requests, could disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming or divert the attention of our management and employees;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of an activist stockholder may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable and need to make changes, which may be exploited by our competitors and make it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel as well as members and service providers;\n\u2022\npursuit of an activist stockholder\u2019s agenda may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategies and create additional value for our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nactions of an activist stockholder may cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to replace a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL. Under Section 203 of the DGCL, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or (i) our board of directors approves the transaction prior to the stockholder acquiring the 15% ownership position, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder acquiring the 15% ownership position, the stockholder owns at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock (excluding shares owned by directors or officers and shares owned by certain employee stock plans) or (iii) the transaction is approved by the Board of Directors and by the stockholders at an annual or special meeting by a vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock (excluding shares held or controlled by the interested stockholder). These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts or make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if the third-party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 13106, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ANGI.1"}
