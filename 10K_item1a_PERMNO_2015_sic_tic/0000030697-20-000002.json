{"cik": "30697", "company": "Wendy's Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2020, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nCompetition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy\u2019s restaurants, could hurt our brand.\nThe market segments in which Company-operated and franchised restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility. If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic. Further, Wendy\u2019s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises. Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends. Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost value meal menu options, and have employed marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures. Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition, which in turn could result in reduced revenue and loss of market share.\nMoreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter market areas in which Wendy\u2019s restaurants operate and target our customer base. For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets. Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can. Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.\nWendy\u2019s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets that sell food to be prepared at home. Competition with these chains and other outlets has increased due to the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants. This increased product and price competition could put deflationary pressure on the selling price of products offered at Wendy\u2019s restaurants.\nAll such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of Company-operated restaurants and royalty revenue from franchised restaurants.\nChanges in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.\nThe quick-service restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition. The success of the Wendy\u2019s system also depends, to a large extent, on continued consumer acceptance of our offerings, the success of our operating, promotional, marketing and new product development initiatives and the reputation of the Wendy\u2019s brand. If we are unable to continue to achieve consumer acceptance or adapt to changes in consumer preferences, nutrition, health or dietary trends (e.g., plant-based food, alternative proteins, low carbohydrate, low trans-fat, gluten free or antibiotic free) or sustainability, animal welfare or other environmental or social concerns, Wendy\u2019s restaurants may lose customers, and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.\nDisruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending. If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees. There can be no assurance that government responses to economic disruptions will restore consumer confidence. Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.\nChanges in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs. Commodity cost pressures, and any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect future operating results. In addition, our business is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations. Further, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef, chicken and pork could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy. Increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs. Significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers. If any increased costs were passed to customers, demand for Wendy\u2019s products may reduce, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses. In addition, Wendy\u2019s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff and employees and key personnel at our restaurant support center, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our results of operations.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage the Wendy\u2019s brand reputation and adversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWendy\u2019s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution (including, for example, interruptions caused by labor disputes or acts of war, terrorism or nature), disease or food-borne illnesses, political unrest, inclement weather or other calamities or conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.\nAs of December 29, 2019, three independent processors (five total production facilities) supplied all of the beef used by Wendy\u2019s U.S. restaurants and five independent processors (11 total production facilities) supplied all of the chicken used by Wendy\u2019s U.S. restaurants. In addition, there was one main in-line distributor of food, packaging and beverage products, excluding breads, that serviced approximately 52% of Wendy\u2019s U.S. restaurants and five additional in-line distributors that, in the aggregate, serviced approximately 47% of Wendy\u2019s U.S. restaurants.\nWendy\u2019s and its franchisees have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, fixtures or other products that are necessary to maintain restaurant operations. Wendy\u2019s anticipates no such shortages of products and believes that alternate suppliers and distribution sources are available. However, if a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or negotiate with such suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us.\nFood safety events, including instances of food-borne illness involving Wendy\u2019s, its supply chain or other food service companies, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to enable our customers to enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future, including at Wendy\u2019s restaurants. Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, chicken or other food products. As a result, Wendy\u2019s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events, whether or not such events involve Wendy\u2019s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.\nInstances or reports, whether true or not, of food-safety issues, such as food-borne illnesses, food tampering, food contamination or mislabeling, either during the growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing, distribution or preparation of products, have in the past severely injured the reputation of companies in the quick-service restaurant industry and could affect Wendy\u2019s as well. Any report linking the Company, Wendy\u2019s restaurants, or our suppliers to food-borne illnesses or food tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage the value of the Wendy\u2019s brand immediately and severely hurt sales of Wendy\u2019s products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), or other damages.\nIn addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy\u2019s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy\u2019s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate. This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products served at Wendy\u2019s restaurants, may reduce demand for Wendy\u2019s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants and could materially and adversely affect our brand, results of operations and financial condition.\nConsumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, chicken, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or the cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could affect demand for our products.\nConsumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, chicken, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or the cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks or health epidemics or pandemics could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.\nIncreased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.\nEvents reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy\u2019s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy\u2019s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate. These and other types of social media risks could reduce demand for Wendy\u2019s food and result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity created or amplified by social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants. Social media risks could also arise from Company or franchise employees not following defined policies for the use of social media during business operations, or actions taken by Company or franchise employees during personal activities outside of their employment, but which could still reflect negatively on the Wendy\u2019s brand.\nGrowth of our restaurant business is dependent to a large extent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.\nOur restaurant business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new restaurant opened. Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent to a large extent on new restaurant openings. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings, which in turn could hurt the business and operating results of Wendy\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s restaurants. These factors include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new franchisees;\n\u2022\nthe availability of site locations for new restaurants (including non-traditional locations);\n\u2022\nthe ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;\n\u2022\nthe ability of restaurant owners to attract, train and retain qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022\nconstruction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;\n\u2022\nthe ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions.\nIn addition, Wendy\u2019s growth strategy includes an increased focus on non-traditional development, such as fuel centers, transportation centers, food courts, military bases and delivery-only locations. Our inability to identify suitable locations, achieve consumer acceptance or otherwise execute our non-traditional development strategy could have an adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.\nWendy\u2019s plans to launch breakfast across the U.S. system. The breakfast daypart is competitive across the restaurant industry and it may prove difficult to achieve market share and reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits.\nAs previously announced, Wendy\u2019s plans to enter the breakfast daypart across the U.S. system on March 2, 2020. The Company and franchisee leadership have worked closely to align with the U.S. system on a breakfast program that the Company believes will drive incremental sales and profits through a strong economic model. However, previous breakfast initiatives were accompanied by competitive pressures and responses from our competitors, some of whom are well-established in the breakfast daypart, operational complexity, challenging food and labor costs, varied consumer acceptance and discretionary spending patterns that differ from other dayparts, and these factors could again impact our ability to achieve market share and reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits. In addition, breakfast sales could cannibalize sales during other parts of the day and may have negative impacts on restaurant margins. The continued active support and engagement of our franchisees is also critical for the successful launch and execution of breakfast. The Company and its franchisees plan to hire additional crew members across the country to support the breakfast initiative. Qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some geographic areas and our inability to successfully recruit, hire, train, motivate and retain qualified employees could adversely affect our operations. The launch of breakfast will also require significant financial resources, including the Company\u2019s plans to support the system by reinvesting royalties from breakfast sales beginning in 2020 to fund incremental marketing and advertising campaigns. Our strategy to launch breakfast across the U.S. system may expose us to additional risks and our inability to successfully execute on our strategy could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWendy\u2019s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.\nAs of December 29, 2019, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy\u2019s system were operated by franchisees. Wendy\u2019s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in our franchise and other agreements with them. Wendy\u2019s also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies and procedures, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures, all of which is done independent of Wendy\u2019s and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules or regulations. Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, then royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and the brand\u2019s image and reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and operating results. In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy\u2019s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\nOur success depends on franchisees\u2019 participation in brand strategies and the ability of our system to respond and adapt to market changes.\nWendy\u2019s franchisees are an integral part of our business and growth strategy. Wendy\u2019s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that we believe are necessary for future growth if franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies. Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies, such as new restaurant development, Image Activation, digital commerce platforms and technologies and the launch of breakfast across the U.S. system, which in turn may harm our business and financial condition. In addition, Wendy\u2019s current franchise model, and the way our brand strategies are executed across the Wendy\u2019s system, may make it difficult for the Wendy\u2019s brand to respond and adapt to the speed of change in technology, consumer preferences, the regulatory environment or other external factors as quickly as may be required to maintain and grow market share and remain competitive.\nOur Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.\nWendy\u2019s continues to implement our Image Activation program, which includes innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs. As of December 29, 2019, approximately 58% of Wendy\u2019s global system restaurants were on the new image, and Wendy\u2019s has plans for a significant number of new and reimaged Company-operated and franchisee restaurants in 2020 and beyond.\nIn order to support our Image Activation program and promote new restaurant development, Wendy\u2019s has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2020, with the value of the incentives declining in the later years of the program. In addition, during 2018, Wendy\u2019s announced a restaurant development incentive program that provides for incremental reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants for existing franchisees that sign up for the program and commit to incremental development of new Wendy\u2019s restaurants under a new development agreement. Wendy\u2019s also provides franchisees with the option of an early 20-year renewal of their franchise agreement upon completion of reimaging utilizing certain approved Image Activation remodel designs.\nThe Company\u2019s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated or franchised restaurants or improve results of operations. There can be no assurance that sales at participating franchised restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that after giving effect to the incentives provided to franchisees the Company\u2019s results of operations will improve. There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.\nFurther, it is possible that Wendy\u2019s may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program. These incentives could also result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future. If Wendy\u2019s provides additional incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, Wendy\u2019s may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans.\nIn addition, approximately 95% of the Wendy\u2019s system consists of franchised restaurants. Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program. Other than the incentive programs described above, Wendy\u2019s generally does not provide franchisees with financing, although we continue to develop third-party financing sources for franchisees. If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and/or the development of new restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur financial results are impacted to a large extent by the operating results of franchisees and the continued renewal of their franchise agreements.\nAs of December 29, 2019, approximately 95% of the Wendy\u2019s system consisted of franchised restaurants. We receive revenues in the form of royalties and national advertising funds contributions (both of which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), as well as rent and fees from franchisees. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, or if the overall business or financial health of franchisees deteriorates, their operating results or financial condition may worsen and our royalty, national advertising funds, rent and other fee revenues may decline. In addition, our accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase. When Company-operated restaurants with leased real estate are sold to franchisees, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases. During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments may increase and we may be required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms. Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease. Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and cash equivalents.\nWendy\u2019s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWendy\u2019s has from time to time acquired Wendy\u2019s restaurants from, and sold Wendy\u2019s restaurants to, franchisees. Wendy\u2019s intends to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees. The success of these transactions is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable. In addition, the operations of restaurants that are acquired from or sold to franchisees may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized. Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to Wendy\u2019s business operations, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;\n\u2022\nincreased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;\n\u2022\nexposure to liabilities arising out of prior operations of acquired restaurants; and\n\u2022\nthe assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.\nEngaging in acquisitions and dispositions also places increased demands on Wendy\u2019s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources. If Wendy\u2019s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, Wendy\u2019s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. These strategic initiatives involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation, general business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the potential distraction of management. Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.\nThe success of any Wendy\u2019s restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations. If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, or at all, Wendy\u2019s ability to execute our growth strategies could be adversely affected.\nWendy\u2019s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.\nAs of December 29, 2019, Wendy\u2019s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 357 Company-operated restaurants. Wendy\u2019s also owned 512 and leased 1,248 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of December 29, 2019. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate. In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the ownership and operation of the restaurants (which may be impacted by competition from similar restaurants in the area) and liability for environmental matters.\nWendy\u2019s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts. We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties. We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities. In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Further, we cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims. See \u201cItem 1. Business - General - Legal and Environmental Matters\u201d for additional information.\nWendy\u2019s leases real property generally for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with one or more options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments. Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals of the term. Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nDue to the concentration of Wendy\u2019s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we and our franchisees operated Wendy\u2019s restaurants in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 30 foreign countries and U.S. territories. As of December 29, 2019, the eight leading states by number of operating U.S. system restaurants were Florida, Texas, Ohio, Georgia, California, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. In addition, as of December 29, 2019, Company-operated restaurants were located only in Florida, Illinois, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado and Rhode Island. This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions or other unforeseen events in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations, regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole. It is possible that adverse economic conditions or other unforeseen events in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy\u2019s restaurants (including Canada, where approximately 41% of the Company\u2019s international restaurants were located as of December 29, 2019) could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.\nOur operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.\nWeather, which is unpredictable, can adversely impact Wendy\u2019s restaurant operations. Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out can result in lost sales and revenues for our restaurants. A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area. Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at Company-operated restaurants. Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins and can result in restaurant operating losses. For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy\u2019s performance or how we may perform in the future.\nOur results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest or other catastrophic events.\nUnforeseen events, such as natural disasters, hostilities (including terrorist activities and public or workplace violence), social unrest or other catastrophic events (including health epidemics or pandemics) can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence levels, restaurant sales and operations and our ability to perform corporate or support functions at our restaurant support center, any of which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nComplaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy\u2019s brand.\nWendy\u2019s customers may file from time to time complaints or lawsuits against us or our franchisees alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy\u2019s restaurant. We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, intellectual property claims, data privacy claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention away from operations, hurt our performance and have a negative impact on the Wendy\u2019s brand. We believe we have adequate accruals for continuing operations for all of our legal and environmental matters, including the accrual that we recorded for the legal proceedings related to a cybersecurity incident as described in Note 23 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein. See Note 11 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information on the accrual. We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved. In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties. Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.\nAdditionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims alleging that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity or otherwise adversely impacted the health of certain of their customers. Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy\u2019s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy\u2019s brand and hurt our business.\nOur intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates, infringes, dilutes or otherwise violates our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance. This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees and diversion of resources. Also, if we do not attempt or\nare unable to successfully protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights, there could be a material adverse effect on our business as a result of, among other things, consumer confusion, dilution of the Wendy\u2019s brand or increased competition from unauthorized users of our brand, each of which may result in decreased revenues to affected restaurants.\nWe franchise the Wendy\u2019s brand to various franchisees. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot ensure that franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy\u2019s brand or restaurant system.\nWe have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and selected foreign jurisdictions. Not all of the trademarks that are used in the Wendy\u2019s system have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business or may do business in the future, and some trademarks will never be registered in all of these countries. Rights in trademarks are generally national in character, and are obtained on a country-by-country basis by the first person to obtain protection through use or registration in that country in connection with specific products or services. Some countries\u2019 laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or make them more difficult to enforce, and third parties have filed, or may in the future file, for \u201cWendy\u2019s\u201d or similar marks. Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect the Wendy\u2019s brand everywhere in the world and use of the Wendy\u2019s brand may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.\nIn addition, we cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials, harm the Wendy\u2019s brand, our image, competitive position or ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions and/or cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, third parties may assert that certain of our intellectual property, or our rights therein, are invalid or unenforceable. If our rights in any of our intellectual property were found to infringe third-party rights, or portions thereof were deemed invalid or unenforceable, we may be forced to defend or resolve related claims and to absorb related expenses. In addition, such loss of rights could permit competing uses of such intellectual property which, in turn, could also harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.\nWe currently maintain insurance we believe to be adequate for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we could encounter that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and property insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company currently maintains insurance coverage to address cyber incidents. Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions. There can be no assurance that the policies covering cyber incidents maintained by the Company will cover substantially all of the Company\u2019s costs and expenses incurred related to previous or future cybersecurity incidents.\nOur success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel and the effectiveness of our leadership structure.\nWe believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team. Our failure to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business. In addition, changes to our leadership and organizational structure can be inherently difficult to manage and if the Company is unable to implement any such changes effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nChanges in legal or regulatory requirements, including licensing approvals, franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy, data privacy laws and accounting standards, as well as an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues, may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including our ability to open new restaurants.\nEach Wendy\u2019s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules. State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations. There can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future. In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.\nFederal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes. We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other state laws that govern these and other employment law matters. Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies could increase our costs and adversely affect our existing and future operations and results. The same consequences may result should any law, rule, regulation, governmental policy or applicable judicial decision declare that Wendy\u2019s is a joint employer with our franchisees. The failure of our digital platforms and technologies to comply with applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, ADA accessibility guidelines and various state, federal and international data privacy laws and regulations) could have an adverse impact on our brand, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 herein for a summary of new or amended accounting standards applicable to us.\nAdditionally, we are working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. These risks could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.\nAlthough we seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy\u2019s system meet quality control standards, Wendy\u2019s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through QSCC, Wendy\u2019s independent purchasing co-op. QSCC manages, for the Wendy\u2019s system in the U.S. and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based on total system volume. We are entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participate in QSCC through our Company-operated restaurants, but we do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to require that all suppliers satisfy our quality control standards. If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy\u2019s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or decides to cease its operations, or if our relationship with QSCC is terminated for any reason, system sales, operating costs and our supply chain management could be adversely affected and the results of operations and financial condition of the Company and franchisees could be negatively impacted.\nOur international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable.\nIn addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy\u2019s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from international franchisees, the inability to protect technology, data or intellectual property rights, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants and the inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners. Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable. In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See Note 8 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for information regarding certain operating losses related to our international operations.\nWendy\u2019s planned expansion into the United Kingdom and other European markets may present increased risks due to low brand awareness, geopolitical risks and other factors.\nAs previously announced, Wendy\u2019s intends to open Company-operated restaurants in the United Kingdom and, if successful, plans to expand into other anchor markets in Europe utilizing a franchise model. New markets, such as the United Kingdom, may have low brand awareness as well as competitive conditions, consumer tastes, discretionary spending patterns and social and cultural differences that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity to build brand awareness, which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations. In addition, we may be unable to obtain desirable locations for new restaurants at reasonable prices, or at all, and restaurants may have higher construction, occupancy, food and labor costs than we currently anticipate. Geopolitical risks, including the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union through a negotiated exit over a period of time, may result in increased regulatory complexities and economic uncertainty. Any of these risks and uncertainties, and other factors we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies to maintain and grow sales, and we cannot predict the impact that these digital commerce platforms and technologies, other new or improved technologies or alternative methods of delivery may have on consumer behavior and our financial results.\nAdvances in technologies, including advances in digital food order and delivery technologies, and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business. Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology and digital engagement and ordering. We may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable guest proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model. However, we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these digital platforms, delivery channels or systems or other technologies or their impact on our business. In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position and the Wendy\u2019s brand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new technologies, or to effectively adjust our product mix, service offerings and marketing initiatives for products and services that address, and anticipate advances in, technology and market trends. If we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges, our business, financial condition, and operating results and the Wendy\u2019s brand could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally, both domestically and internationally. Our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. If Wendy\u2019s digital commerce platforms do not meet customers\u2019 expectations in terms of security, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms, which could negatively impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, misuse, interruption or security breach of our computer systems, technology or social media platforms could adversely affect our business.\nWe are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and information technology. The failure of these systems and information technology to operate effectively, an interruption in such systems or technology, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, fraudulent manipulation of sales reporting from our franchised restaurants resulting in loss of sales and royalty payments, or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems. Additionally, the success of certain of our strategic initiatives, including to expand our consumer-facing digital capabilities to connect with customers and drive growth, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Any security breach involving our or our franchisees\u2019 point-of-sale or other systems could result in a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud. Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. A security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in consumer confidence, sales and profits or cause us to incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.\nAs part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain customers. These efforts may not be successful, and could pose a variety of other risks, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about the Wendy\u2019s brand, the exposure of personally identifiable information, the failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations or fraud. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by franchisees, customers or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage the brand\u2019s reputation. The occurrence of any such developments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, as previously announced, we have implemented a plan to realign and reinvest resources in our IT organization to strengthen its ability to accelerate growth. We are partnering with a third-party global IT consultant on this new structure to leverage their global capabilities and enable a more seamless integration between our digital and corporate IT assets. Under the new structure, we are dependent to a significant extent on our ongoing relationship and engagement with the consultant, including their personnel and resources, technological expertise and ability to help execute our digital and restaurant and enterprise technology initiatives. Risks associated with our IT realignment plan, including the ultimate costs incurred in connection with such plan, could have an adverse impact on our restaurant operations and support, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise of confidential information and/or damage to our employee and business relationships, all of which could subject us to loss and harm the Wendy\u2019s brand.\nA cyber incident includes any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, vendors and employees. A number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems. In 2015 and 2016, certain of our franchisees experienced cybersecurity incidents, as further described below. As the Company\u2019s reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, both internal and those managed by third parties. Three primary risks that could result from a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with customers, franchisees and employees and exposure of private data. In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, the Company has also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks. However, these measures, as well as the increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that the Company\u2019s reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident.\nBecause the Company and its franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers, the Company\u2019s business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that the Company and its franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom the Company and its franchisees contract to provide credit card processing and related services. The Company also maintains important internal Company data, such as personally identifiable information about its employees and franchisees and information relating to its operations. The Company\u2019s use of personally identifiable information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, the Company\nmay incur additional costs to ensure that it remains in compliance with those laws and regulations. If the Company\u2019s security and information systems are compromised or if its employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, disrupt its operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations. A cyber incident could also require the Company to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties and cause the Company to incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nCertain of our franchisees have experienced cybersecurity incidents.\nIn February 2016, the Company reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants and that malware had been discovered on certain systems. In June 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled. In July 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware.\nAs a result of the cybersecurity incidents, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the United States on behalf of consumers, as well as in five class actions brought by financial institutions in the United States that were subsequently consolidated into a single proceeding. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s present and former directors, and one non-director executive officer of the Company, were named as defendants in putative shareholder derivative complaints, which have been consolidated into one action, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment and gross mismanagement. These civil proceedings sought damages and other relief allegedly arising from the cybersecurity incidents. On February 26, 2019, the court granted final approval of the settlement of the consumer class action, and on November 6, 2019, the court granted final approval of the settlement of the financial institutions class action. Both matters are now considered fully paid and closed. On January 24, 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement of the putative shareholder derivative action. These and any other claims or investigations related to the cybersecurity incidents may adversely affect how we or our franchisees operate the business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, result in additional costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.\nWe have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment, such as:\n\u2022\nsignificant adverse changes in the business climate;\n\u2022\ncurrent period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;\n\u2022\na current expectation that more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and\n\u2022\na significant drop in our stock price.\nBased upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our business, future impairment charges could be incurred. Further, as a result of our system optimization initiative, the Company has recorded losses on remeasuring long-lived assets to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of Company-operated restaurants, and the Company may incur further losses as the Company sells additional restaurants from time to time.\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility.\nWendy\u2019s Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, is the master issuer (the \u201cMaster Issuer\u201d) of outstanding senior secured notes under a securitized financing facility entered into in June 2015. Under the facility, the Master Issuer issued the following currently outstanding series of notes: (i) Series 2019-1 3.783% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I, with an initial principal amount of $400.0 million; (ii) Series 2019-1 4.080% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II, with an initial principal amount of $450.0 million; (iii) Series 2018-1 3.573% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I, with an initial principal amount of $450.0 million; (iv) Series 2018-1 3.884% Fixed Rate Senior\nSecured Notes, Class A-2-II, with an initial principal amount of $475.0 million; and (v) Series 2015-1 4.497% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-III, with an initial principal amount of $500.0 million (collectively, the \u201cClass A-2 Notes\u201d). The Master Issuer also issued outstanding Series 2019-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1, which allows for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis (the \u201cClass A-1 Notes\u201d and, together with the Class A-2 Notes, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d).\nThe Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the \u201cSecuritization Entities\u201d), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and the related guarantee and collateral agreement. The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, certain Company-operated restaurants, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.\nThe Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.\nIn the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.\nIn addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the Company and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, (ii) sell certain assets, (iii) create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or (iv) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy\u2019s system, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future growth prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe Company has a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.\nAs of December 29, 2019, the Company had approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet. Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued the Class A-1 Notes, which allows for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis.\nThis level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company\u2019s future operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nresulting in an event of default if the Company\u2019s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of the Company\u2019s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, equity and debt repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nsubjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company\u2019s business, the industry in which it operates and the general economy; and\n\u2022\nplacing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged.\nFurther, the Class A-1 Notes may accrue interest based on the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), which is expected to be discontinued after 2021. If LIBOR is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders or the resulting impact on our interest expense.\nThe ability of Wendy\u2019s to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance and ability to generate significant cash flows. Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, the ability of Wendy\u2019s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future. Specifically, Wendy\u2019s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the Company\u2019s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs. If the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.\nIn addition, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks. If consumer preferences change and the Company\u2019s customers purchase fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company. The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing. Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified. In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees. These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.\nThe Company may incur additional indebtedness, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities in the future. If new debt, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities are added to the Company\u2019s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could be amplified.\nThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its common stock in the future.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as the Company\u2019s Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company\u2019s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. In addition, because the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries. The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to the holding company is dependent upon their ability to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the requirements and restrictions under the Company\u2019s securitized financing facility and other debt agreements.\nA substantial amount of the Company\u2019s common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.\nNelson Peltz, the Company\u2019s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, the Company\u2019s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Edward Garden, a former director of the Company, beneficially own shares of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock that collectively constitute approximately 19% of its total voting power as of February 18, 2020. Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock.\nOn December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the \u201cTrian Agreement\u201d) with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the \u201cCovered Persons\u201d). Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cSection 203\u201d), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership. Certain other provisions of the Trian Agreement terminated when the Covered Persons\u2019 beneficial ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock decreased to less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company in January 2014.\nThis concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company. If in the future Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden were to acquire more than a majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.\nCertain provisions in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company. The Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock. The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable. Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure that it will not do so in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates.", "PERMNO": 89818, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "WEN"}
