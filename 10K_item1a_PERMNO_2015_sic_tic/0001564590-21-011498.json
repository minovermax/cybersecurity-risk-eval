Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment. As used in the risks described in this subsection, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d are intended to refer to the Company unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\nRisk Factor Summary\nFollowing is a summary of the principal risk factors to our business, which risks are more fully described below the summary.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n\u2022\nIf we fail to retain existing diners or add new diners, or if our diners decrease their number of orders or order sizes on the Platforms, our revenue, financial results, and business may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nIf our delivery service levels decline or if restaurants do not see increases in business, restaurants could leave the Platforms, reducing revenue and significantly harming our business.\n\u2022\nWe generate a substantial amount of our revenue from restaurants viewed positively by diners. The loss of restaurants to other platforms could seriously harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to continue to grow at historical growth rates or achieve profitability in the future.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to a variety of risks relating to our relationships with the independent contractor drivers, including shortages of available drivers, loss of independent contractor drivers, adverse conditions impacting independent contractor drivers, and possible increases in driver compensation.\n\u2022\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands, our ability to expand our base of diners and restaurants may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed. Unfavorable media coverage could seriously harm our business.\n\u2022\nSeasonality and the impact of inclement weather could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\n\u2022\nOur inability to manage growth and meet demand could harm our operations and brands.\n\u2022\nOur efforts to improve the experience of restaurants and diners may not be successful and the related investment may impact our profitability.\n\u2022\nOur operations depend on mobile operating systems, hardware, networks and standards that we do not control. Changes in our products or to those operating systems, hardware, networks or standards may seriously harm our Active Diner growth, retention, and engagement.\n\u2022\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of diners and engagement, or adversely affect our financial results.\n\u2022\nPersonal data, internet security breaches or loss of data provided by diners or restaurants on our Platforms could violate applicable law and contracts with key service providers and could result in liability to us, damage to our reputation and brands and harm to our business.\n\u2022\nWe have limited operational history and are subject to developmental risks associated with the development of any new business.\n\u2022\nIf we become a payment processor at some point in the future, we would be required to comply with applicable laws and standards. Inability to comply with applicable laws or standards could result in harm to our business.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to the credit card and debit card payments we accept.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide products and services, and we could be adversely impacted if they fail to fulfill their obligations.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to successfully compete in technology innovation and distribution. If we are unable to continue to innovate and provide technology desirable to diners and restaurants, our business operations could materially suffer.\n\u2022\nAs part of our business strategy, we have effected, and may continue to effect, acquisitions to grow our business. Failure to pursue and successfully make additional acquisitions could negatively impact our future growth.\n\u2022\nThe terms of the agreements governing our debt contain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\n\u2022\nAdditional impairments of the carrying amounts of goodwill or other indefinite-lived assets could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe depend on search engines, display advertising, social media, email, content-based online advertising and other online sources to attract diners to the Platforms. If we are unable to attract diners and convert them into Active Diners making orders in a cost-effective manner, our business and financial results may be harmed.\n\u2022\nThe loss of senior management or key operating personnel could adversely affect our operations. We depend on skilled personnel to grow and operate our business, and our failure to hire, retain or attract key personnel could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nMajor hurricanes, tropical cyclones, major snow and/or ice storms in areas not accustomed to them and other instances of severe weather and other natural phenomena could cause significant losses.\n\u2022\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders and harm our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe are currently party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability and expenses for legal claims from the normal course of business activities.\n\u2022\nOur use of open source software could expose us to \u201ccopyleft\u201d claims or otherwise subject us to business or legal risk.\n\u2022\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. Insufficient capital can harm our operating, business and financial results.\n\u2022\nIf our employees were to unionize, our operating costs could increase and our ability to compete could be impaired.\n\u2022\nFailure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\u2022\nOur industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and our business and results of operations may suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing and other competitive pressures.\n\u2022\nOur business depends on discretionary spending patterns in the areas in which the restaurants on our Platforms operate and in the economy at large. Economic downturns or other events (like coronavirus or similar widespread health/pandemic outbreaks) impacting the United States and global economy could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur industry is affected by general economic and business risks that are largely beyond our control.\n\u2022\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our operations.\n\u2022\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several jurisdictions have implemented or are considering implementing fee caps, fee disclosure requirements and similar measures that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\n\u2022\nWe rely on restaurants in our network for many aspects of our business, and their failure to maintain their service levels could harm our business.\n\u2022\nIf use of the Internet via websites, mobile devices and other platforms, particularly with respect to online ordering, does not continue to increase as rapidly as we anticipate, our business and growth prospects may be harmed.\n\u2022\nThe nature of our business and content on the Platforms exposes us to potential liability and expenses for legal claims that could materially affect our results of operations and business.\n\u2022\nOur storage, processing and use of data, some of which contains personal information, subjects us to complex and evolving federal and state laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, any of which could seriously harm our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\n\u2022\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares by existing stockholders could cause our share price to decline.\n\u2022\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nThe Debt Warrants, Notes and other Derivative Securities are exercisable/convertible into shares of our common stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nIf we fail to retain existing diners or add new diners, or if our diners decrease their number of orders or order sizes on the Platforms, our revenue, financial results, and business may be adversely affected.\nOur financial performance has been significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging Active Diners who make orders for delivery, dine-in or carryout using the Platforms. We anticipate that our Active Diner growth rate could decline over time as the size of our Active Diner base increases, and as we achieve higher market penetration rates. To the extent our Active Diner growth rate slows, our business performance could become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase the size and frequency of orders in current and new markets. If diners do not perceive the Platforms to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain diners or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and amount of orders. A decrease in diner retention, growth, order frequency or overall order price could render the Platforms less attractive to restaurants, which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any number of factors could negatively affect diner retention, growth, and engagement, thereby adversely affecting our revenue, financial results, and future growth potential, including if:\n\u2022\ndiners increasingly order through competing products or services;\n\u2022\nwe fail to introduce new and improved services or if new services are not favorably received;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to successfully maintain our efforts to provide a satisfactory delivery and ordering experience;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\n\u2022\nthere are changes in diner sentiment about the quality or usefulness of the Platforms, delivery quality, food quality or other products or concerns related to privacy and sharing, safety, security, or other factors;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure diners are presented with menu items that are interesting, useful, and relevant to them;\n\u2022\nthere are adverse changes in the Platforms, delivery services or restaurant services or products that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements or consent decrees;\n\u2022\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering food in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience or enjoyment of food or beverages delivered;\n\u2022\nwe adopt policies or procedures related to delivery, ordering or user data that are perceived negatively by our diners or the general public;\n\u2022\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to restaurants, diners, independent contractor drivers, or advertisers;\n\u2022\nwe, restaurants on the Platforms, or other companies in the mobile food delivery or ordering industry are the subject of adverse media reports, adverse litigation, or long-term governmental regulation such as fee caps, or other negative publicity;\n\u2022\nrestaurants develop their own direct-to-consumer applications or online ordering and delivery services; or\n\u2022\nwe are unable to maintain and increase our Active Diner base and order frequency or our Average Daily Orders and Gross Food Sales.\nIf our delivery service levels decline or if restaurants do not see increases in business, restaurants could leave the Platforms, reducing revenue and significantly harming our business.\nRestaurants may not continue to do business with us or may be unwilling to pay service fees if we do not deliver food, groceries and beverages in a timely, professional and friendly manner or if the restaurants do not believe that their investment in the Waitr platform or the Bite Squad platform, as applicable, will produce an increase in revenue from delivery, dine-in or carryout orders. Our service fees and commission revenue and the availability of restaurants on the Platforms could be negatively impacted by the following factors, among others:\n\u2022\ndecreases in the number of Active Diners or Average Daily Orders on the Platforms;\n\u2022\nloss of online or mobile food delivery market share to competitors;\n\u2022\ninability to professionally and accurately display menu items to consumers on the Platforms;\n\u2022\nadverse media reports or other negative publicity involving the Company, restaurants on our Platforms or other companies in our industry; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of macroeconomic conditions and conditions in the restaurant industry in general, including restaurant closures.\nWe generate a substantial amount of our revenue from restaurants viewed positively by diners. The loss of restaurants to other platforms could seriously harm our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from items offered by restaurants to diners on the Platforms. The number of Active Diners, Average Daily Orders and Gross Food Sales depends on the availability of quality items available on the Platforms from restaurants viewed positively by diners. As is typical in our industry, restaurants do not agree to long-term contracts with us, and they are generally free to leave the Platforms with minimal notice or to participate on competing platforms. While no single restaurant accounts for more than 10% of our revenue, many of the restaurants on our Platforms only recently started providing menu items on the Platforms, and they spend a relatively small portion of their overall budget with us. In addition, some restaurants may view the Platforms as experimental and unproven. Restaurants may not continue to do business with us if we do not increase revenues for them or provide delivery, dine-in or carryout ordering for diners in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that the use of the Platforms will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, including from our competitors.\nGrowth in the number of restaurants on the Platforms may not continue at historical rates, and the addition of new restaurants to the Platforms and retention of existing restaurants on the Platforms could decline due to a number of factors. First, the cost of adding new restaurants or retaining existing restaurants on the Platforms could increase substantially. Competition to advertise our services to restaurants has been increasing and could continue to increase as a result of increasing competition among similar companies for a finite pool of restaurants. In addition, the number of options available to restaurants may result in downward pressure on the prices that restaurants are willing to pay for our services. As more choices become available for diners to order delivery, dine-in or carryout from restaurants, the number and frequency of our word-of-mouth and/or organic referrals may decline. Our efforts to attract and retain new restaurants in new geographical areas may not be successful.\nIf we fail to attract new restaurants or retain existing restaurants, especially those restaurants that are most popular with diners, our financial results could materially suffer.\nWe may be unable to continue to grow at historical growth rates or achieve profitability in the future.\nOur revenue has grown year over year, but this growth rate may not be sustainable. The growth rates of Active Diners and Gross Food Sales could decline over time as the market for our services matures. Diner growth, the addition of new restaurants to the Platforms and our revenue growth rates could decline as the size of our Active Diner base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates. If our growth rates decline, investors\u2019 perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. While we have achieved profitability during the last three quarters of 2020, we may have unprofitable results in the future, for several reasons, including insufficient growth in new menu items, declining numbers of Active Diners or orders, increasing competition, costs to scale our business and technology and other risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks relating to our relationships with the independent contractor drivers, including shortages of available drivers, loss of independent contractor drivers, adverse conditions impacting independent contractor drivers, and possible increases in driver compensation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we terminated our employee drivers and outsourced our driver function to Delivery Logistics, who provides us with independent contractor drivers. While we implemented this change in a way intended to ensure that the drivers are indeed independent contractors under applicable law and regulation, certain state and local governmental authorities have recently initiated efforts to classify independent contractors performing driver jobs as employees. In January 2020, California State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d) went into effect, which codifies an employee-friendly test to determine whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor under California law. However, in November 2020, California voters passed Proposition 22, the App-Based Drivers as Contractors and Labor Policies Initiative. Proposition 22 classifies app-based transportation and delivery drivers as independent contractors and adopts various labor and wage policies specific to this class of workers, which policies will likely increase operating costs. Many legal experts have stated that the passage of Proposition 22 effectively exempts this class of workers from the reach of AB5. While the Company does not operate in California, the Company has received misclassification claims and may see an increase in claims from other states that have adopted or may adopt classification tests similar to AB5 (without any similar Proposition 22 carve-out for app-based delivery drivers) and there can be no assurance that any claim will not be combined into a collective or class action. These regulatory actions and/or increased scrutiny could result in increased costs and burdens for the Company.\nThe change in composition of our driver base could also result in a degradation of service provided by contracted delivery drivers, and an increase in the turnover rates of delivery drivers. If Delivery Logistics is unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of independent contractor drivers, we could face difficulty meeting consumer order demands or be forced to forego business that would otherwise be available to us, which could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our business.\nShortages of available drivers could require us to spend more to procure driver services and could create shortages at peak order times. We could face a challenge with having enough qualified drivers primarily due to intense market competition, which may subject us to increased payments for independent contractor driver rates that would negatively impact our profitability.\nFurther, with respect to independent contractor drivers, shortages can result from the absence of long-term contracts along with other contractual terms or policies that make contracting with Delivery Logistics less desirable to certain independent contractor drivers. In addition, the \u201con-call\u201d or \u201con-demand\u201d nature of the way that we ask independent contractor drivers to pick up shifts during busy times may result in difficulties procuring such independent contractor drivers when we need that labor most. Such a shortage could result in material harm to our business or reputation.\nThe financial condition and operating costs of the independent contractor drivers are affected by conditions and events that are beyond our control and may also be beyond their control. Adverse changes in the financial condition of independent contractor drivers or increases in their car ownership or operating costs could cause them to seek higher revenues or to cease their business relationships with Delivery Logistics. The prices that we charge our diners could be impacted by these circumstances, which may in turn limit pricing flexibility with diners, resulting in fewer delivery orders and decreasing our revenues.\nIndependent contractor drivers may utilize shirts and food carrier equipment bearing our trade names and trademarks; however, it is not required. If one of the independent contractor drivers is subject to negative publicity, it could negatively reflect on us and have a material and adverse effect on our business, brand and financial performance. Under certain state laws, we could also be subject to allegations of liability for the activities of the independent contractor drivers.\nAs independent business owners, independent contractor drivers may make business or personal decisions that conflict with our best interests. For example, if route distance is further than desired or personal scheduling conflicts arise, an independent contractor driver may deny orders from time to time. In these circumstances, we must be able to timely deliver food orders to maintain relationships with diners and restaurants on the Platforms. The unwillingness of independent contractor drivers to perform their services when and where they are needed could adversely harm our financial performance and operating results.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands, our ability to expand our base of diners and restaurants may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed. Unfavorable media coverage could seriously harm our business.\nOur brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of diners and restaurants. Many of our new diners are referred by existing diners, and, therefore, we strive to ensure that our diners remain favorably inclined towards the Platforms and our online ordering service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands could depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative services, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new services, products or terms of service that diners do not like, which may negatively affect our brands.\nAdditionally, the actions of restaurants that are on our Platforms (or quality and safety of their food), independent contractor drivers and others may negatively affect our brands if consumers do not have a positive experience interacting with those parties after using the Platforms. We may experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our delivery and food safety record, our delivery experience, privacy matters or other issues, which may adversely affect our reputation and brands. We may also fail to provide adequate customer service, which could erode confidence in our brands. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. We face the potential loss of use of our trade name \u201cWaitr\u201d due to certain litigation (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings below). If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, if we lose the right to our trade name, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nSeasonality and the impact of inclement weather could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe observe that diner behavior patterns and demand for the services we provide generally fluctuate during the year on both of our Platforms. For example, order frequency tends to vary, primarily as a result of weather patterns, university summer breaks and other vacation periods. In addition, orders in cities or towns with college campuses tend to fluctuate with the start and end of the school year, which can comprise a large part of our overall revenue in certain locations. Our revenues fluctuate according to these patterns and due to the timing of certain holidays within each quarter and result in quarterly fluctuations. As a result, diner activity and demand for our services has historically been stronger in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to our second and third fiscal quarters. In addition, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality and diner behavior that we experience may change or become more extreme, including as a result of factors outside of our control. For example, as shown in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on our typical seasonality trends and could impact future periods.\nWe sometimes experience large influxes of orders during inclement weather when consumers do not wish to leave their homes to eat restaurant food. Such inclement weather events are unpredictable in many cases and may continue to provide disruption in future periods in certain markets. In such events, the availability of independent contractor drivers could be limited due to unsafe driving conditions or the refusal or unwillingness of drivers to work during such weather events. This can result in substantially delayed delivery times and diner frustration with our services, reducing the willingness of consumers to order using the Platforms in the future. We have in the past experienced increased order volume during certain holidays, while facing a simultaneous shortage in drivers, which can also result in substantial delivery delays and diner dissatisfaction. In addition, the likelihood of accidents may increase during inclement weather events, thereby increasing the costs to us of each delivery, exposing us to potential litigation or accident claims. Any of these events could substantially impact our revenue and results of operations and our ability to grow and operate our business.\nOur inability to manage growth and meet demand could harm our operations and brands.\nOccasions have arisen in the past in which we were not able to adequately meet surges in orders and consumer demand. We may be required to make substantial investments in the future in technology, customer service, sales and marketing infrastructure in order to adequately handle growth, surges in orders and consumer demands. As we continue to grow, we must be able to effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. We may not be able to manage growth effectively. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of the Platforms and efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could harm our brands, business and results of operations.\nOur efforts to improve the experience of restaurants and diners may not be successful and the related investment may impact our profitability.\nOur culture prioritizes an excellent diner and restaurant experience and loyalty. Our efforts in achieving improved diner and restaurant experience and loyalty may not produce the short-term or long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth and engagement, our relationships with diners and restaurants, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations depend on mobile operating systems, hardware, networks and standards that we do not control. Changes in our products or to those operating systems, hardware, networks or standards may seriously harm our Active Diner growth, retention, and engagement.\nA large percentage of our revenues and growth occur on mobile devices using the Waitr App and the Bite Squad App, or collectively, the \u201cApps.\u201d Because the Apps are used primarily on mobile devices, the Apps must remain interoperable with popular mobile operating systems, Android and iOS, and related hardware, including but not limited to mobile devices. We have no control over these operating systems or hardware, and any changes to these systems or hardware that degrade the functionality of our products, or give preferential treatment to competitive products, could seriously harm the usage of the Apps on mobile devices. Our competitors could attempt to make arrangements with Apple or Google to make interoperability of our products with those mobile operating systems more difficult or display their competitive offerings more prominently than ours. Similarly, our competitors could enter into other arrangements with mobile device manufacturers, wireless network carriers or Internet service providers that diminish the functionality of the Apps. We plan to continue to introduce new products regularly and have experienced that it takes time to optimize such products to function with these operating systems and hardware, impacting the popularity of such products, and this trend could continue.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of diners and engagement, or adversely affect our financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve diners and restaurants depend upon the reliable performance of the Platforms and their underlying technical infrastructure. We have experienced service disruptions, and may experience future disruptions, outages or other performance problems due to a variety of factors. As the Platforms grow more complex, store more information and service higher numbers of diners, their technical infrastructure could suffer. We may not be able to identify causes of performance issues or service disruptions.\nOur systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If the Platforms are unavailable when diners, independent contractor drivers or restaurants attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as they expect, these key users may not return to the Platforms as often in the future, or at all. As our Active Diners and restaurants and the amount and types of information shared on the Platforms continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity, and computing power, to continue to satisfy the needs of our diners, restaurants on the Platforms and the independent contractor delivery drivers. It is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands. In addition, our business is subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from natural disasters, terrorism, or other catastrophic events.\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Substantially all of the communications, network and computer hardware used to operate our websites and mobile applications are located in the United States in Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform data centers. We do not own or control the operation of these facilities. In addition, we may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances. We may not always maintain redundancy for certain hardware. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of the Platforms and to enable rapid releases of new features and products. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, respond adequately to service disruptions, upgrade our systems as needed or continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on technology infrastructure and services to handle the traffic on our websites and mobile applications and to help shorten the length of or prevent system interruptions. The operation of these systems is expensive and complex, and we could experience operational failures.\nAlthough we carry business interruption insurance, it may not be sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to the future growth of our business that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\nPersonal data, internet security breaches or loss of data provided by diners or restaurants on our Platforms could violate applicable law and contracts with key service providers and could result in liability to us, damage to our reputation and brands and harm to our business.\nMobile malware, viruses, hacking, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur on our systems in the future. Although it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from an interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of restaurants or diners may seriously harm our reputation and our ability to retain and attract diners and restaurants.\nWe rely on third-party billing and payment processing providers, many of whom may collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected personal information. Examples include third parties who process diner orders, payroll and other payments, and service providers who collect and store diner, restaurant or employee information. We may also process and store and use additional third parties to process and store sensitive intellectual property and other proprietary business information, including that of the restaurants on our Platforms. While we intend to maintain data privacy and security measures that are compliant with applicable privacy laws and regulations, future security breaches could subject us and/or these third-party service providers to liability for violations of various laws, rules or regulations, civil liability, government-imposed fines, orders requiring that we or these third parties change our or their practices, or criminal charges, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe have limited operational history and are subject to developmental risks associated with the development of any new business.\nWe lack significant operational history by which future performance may be judged or compared. Any future success that we may enjoy will depend upon many factors, several of which may be beyond our control, or which cannot be predicted at this time, and which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business prospects and operations and the value of an investment in the Company. As a result, our past quarterly financial results do not necessarily indicate future performance. Investors should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Investors should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance. The numerous factors, which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, include the following:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast revenues and plan operating expenses;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to fund our working capital requirements or maintain compliance with our debt covenants, particularly if our forecast regarding the sufficiency of our liquidity is inaccurate or our expenses exceed our expectations;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to scale our technological and operational infrastructure to accommodate rapid growth in diners, orders or customer support needs;\n\u2022\nOur growth may depend on acquisitions, and we may lack the capital necessary to pursue them;\n\u2022\nOur still relatively recent transition to a public company could pose operational, financial and quality risks that we are unable to manage effectively;\n\u2022\nThe development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors is uncertain;\n\u2022\nCompeting with traditional ordering methods or delivery services provided directly by restaurants (or third parties) to consumers over the phone or through their own websites or other means could pose a risk to our growth and financial performance;\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain, retain and grow our number of Active Diners, Average Daily Orders, Gross Food Sales and order frequency is not guaranteed;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract and retain restaurants over long periods of time has not been tested in several markets;\n\u2022\nWe may prove unable to attract and retain key employees and personnel to support growth;\n\u2022\nSeasonal and weather-related fluctuations in spending by consumers relating to food delivery can be unpredictable;\n\u2022\nThe acceptable pricing of our services and commission fees to restaurants and diner fees to consumers has not been tested widely;\n\u2022\nOur ability to increase services, diner fees and other revenue does not enjoy long historical data trends and any increases in our costs may be met with adverse restaurant response that could materially negatively impact revenue as affected restaurants may withdraw from our Platforms;\n\u2022\nWe have yet to demonstrate our ability to diversify and grow material revenue sources beyond current services and diner fees;\n\u2022\nIncreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive are unpredictable;\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins can be difficult to predict and impacted by numerous factors beyond our control (for example, due to transaction charge increases, technology cost increases, competitive pricing and other items);\n\u2022\nWe may experience system failures or breaches of security and privacy that could pose a harm on their own and could affect consumers\u2019 confidence in our services;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to adequately manage key third-party service providers;\n\u2022\nWe may experience changes in diner or restaurant behavior or preferences;\n\u2022\nPayment processing costs could increase, or we could fail to implement our own payment processing solution;\n\u2022\nGiven the rapid pace of our evolution into a public company, our internal controls may not be able to keep pace with necessary requirements from a business, accounting or legal point of view; and\n\u2022\nWe may experience safety hazards or issues with independent contractor drivers or third parties that come into contact with the drivers, which could be difficult to predict and which could impact our operating costs and diner or restaurant use of the Platforms.\nIf we become a payment processor at some point in the future, we would be required to comply with applicable laws and standards. Inability to comply with applicable laws or standards could result in harm to our business.\nAlthough we currently do not directly store or process payments on behalf of restaurants or diners and use third parties to do so, we may choose to do so in the future. We would need to comply with Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d) if we choose to pursue this possibility. The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security that was developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Payment card network rules would require us to comply with the Standard, and our failure to do so may result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards if we elected to become a payment processor.\nUnder certain circumstances specified in the payment card network rules, we could be required in the future to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that we had failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self-assessment or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time-consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Payment processing businesses involve complex financial, cybersecurity and other factors that may be difficult to us. We cannot ensure that the cost savings or additional revenue from becoming a payment processor would exceed the significant costs associated with that decision. While we are currently PCI compliant on both Platforms, there can be no assurance that we will remain compliant.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to the credit card and debit card payments we accept.\nWe accept payments through credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. An increase in those fees may require us to increase the prices we charge and would increase our operating expenses, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently rely exclusively on one third-party vendor to provide payment processing services, including the processing of payments from credit cards and debit cards, and our business would be disrupted if this vendor becomes unwilling or unable to provide these services to us and we are unable to find a suitable replacement on a timely basis. If we or our processing vendor fails to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions, it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if these systems fail to work properly and, as a result, we do not charge our customers\u2019 credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail\nto comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we or the restaurants accept, or if payment-related data are compromised due to a breach of data, we may be liable for significant costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, and significantly higher credit card-related costs, each of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it more difficult for us to comply. We are required to comply with payment card industry security standards. Failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations, and the terms of our contracts with payment processors. Any failure to comply fully also may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. Further, there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, card holders and transactions.\nIf we fail to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels, our processing vendor may increase its transaction fees or terminate its relationship with us. Any increases in applicable credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our service to offset the increase. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide products and services, and we could be adversely impacted if they fail to fulfill their obligations.\nWe depend on third-party vendors and partners to provide us with certain products and services, including components of our computer systems, software, data centers, payment processors and telecommunications networks, to conduct our business. For example, we rely on third parties for services such as organizing and accumulating certain daily transaction data on orders. We also rely on third parties for specific software and hardware used in providing our products and services. Some of these organizations and service providers may provide similar services and technology to our competitors, and we do not have long-term or exclusive contracts with them.\nOur systems and operations or those of our third-party vendors and partners could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, acts of terrorism, human error, vandalism or sabotage, financial insolvency, bankruptcy and similar events. In addition, we may be unable to renew our existing contracts with our most significant vendors and partners or our vendors and partners may stop providing or otherwise supporting the products and services we obtain from them, and we may not be able to obtain these or similar products or services on the same or similar terms as our existing arrangements, if at all. The failure of our vendors and partners to perform their obligations and provide the products and services we obtain from them in a timely manner for any reason could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe may not be able to successfully compete in technology innovation and distribution. If we are unable to continue to innovate and provide technology desirable to diners and restaurants, our business operations could materially suffer.\nWe must continuously innovate to improve our existing Platform technology and ensure that our products and services are well received. Mobile applications, internet-enabled technology and online e-commerce are constantly changing. We face competition from larger and more established companies, and smaller companies also provide similar services and technology. Our competitors may also develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance. These products, features, and services may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nOur ability to compete effectively in the deployment of innovative products depends on factors outside of our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nusefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our products compared to those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nsize and composition of base of Active Diners;\n\u2022\nengagement of Active Diners with the Platforms;\n\u2022\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to the Platforms or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\ncustomer service and support efforts;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers.\nDeveloping the Platforms, which include the Apps, websites and other technologies, entails significant technical and business risks. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced products or if our recently introduced products do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the restaurants and diners in our network may forego the use of our products in favor of those of our competitors.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have effected, and may continue to effect, acquisitions to grow our business. Failure to pursue and successfully make additional acquisitions could negatively impact our future growth.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have effected acquisitions to add complementary companies, products and technologies to grow our business. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete these acquisitions. Additionally, the continuing trend toward consolidation in the online and mobile app ordering and delivery industry may result in larger companies with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages than Waitr\u2019s and could affect our ability to successfully make additional acquisitions, which may impact our growth rates and ability to maintain profitability.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our debt contain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe are party to a Credit Agreement and Convertible Notes Agreement (see Part II, Item 8, Note 9 - Debt). These agreements include a number of customary covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional debt, incur liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, dispose of assets, pay dividends or repurchase capital stock and repay certain junior indebtedness. The aforementioned restrictions are subject to certain exceptions including the ability to incur additional indebtedness, liens, dividends, and prepayments of junior indebtedness subject, in each case, to compliance with certain financial metrics and/or certain other conditions and a number of other traditional exceptions that grant Waitr Inc. continued flexibility to operate and develop its business. In certain cases, these covenants may impose limitations or restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our business and could place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors. Included in these covenants is an affirmative covenant relating to the deliverance of audited annual financial statements to the administrative agent and lenders, accompanied by a report from an independent public accounting firm, which report shall be unqualified as to going concern and scope of audit.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet these covenants. From time to time, we may be required to seek waivers or amendments to the Credit Agreement and Convertible Notes Agreement to maintain compliance with these covenants, and there can be no certainty that any such waiver or amendment will be available. Non-compliance with one or more of these covenants could result in any amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and Convertible Notes Agreement becoming immediately due and payable. Additionally, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, both the Credit Agreement and Convertible Notes Agreement provide for default interest at a rate that is 2% and 5% higher, respectively, than the interest rates otherwise payable under the agreements. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either when they mature or in the event of a default, we may need to engage in debt or equity financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nAdditional impairments of the carrying amounts of goodwill or other indefinite-lived assets could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct our goodwill and intangible asset impairment test annually as of October 1, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, and we review the recoverability of long-lived assets, including acquired technology, capitalized software costs, and property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of testing for goodwill impairment, we have one reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we experienced a sustained decline in market capitalization as a result of adverse changes in market conditions from increased competition which negatively affected our order and revenue growth. This resulted in the recognition of a total non-cash pre-tax impairment loss of $191.2 million to write down the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, including capitalized contract costs, customer relationships and developed technology, to their implied fair values. See Part II, Item 8, Note 7 - Intangible Assets and Goodwill of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible assets requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates\nused could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that additional goodwill or intangible assets will not be impaired and that the carrying value of other indefinite-lived assets will be recoverable in future periods, which could adversely affect our financial results and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on search engines, display advertising, social media, email, content-based online advertising and other online sources to attract diners to the Platforms. If we are unable to attract diners and convert them into Active Diners making orders in a cost-effective manner, our business and financial results may be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract online diners to the Platforms and convert them into orders in a cost-effective manner. We depend, in part, on search engines, display advertising, social media, email, content-based online advertising and other online sources to generate traffic to our websites and downloads of the Apps. We are included in search results as a result of both paid search listings, where we purchase specific search terms that result in the inclusion of our advertisement, and, separately, organic searches that depend upon the content on websites owned and maintained by us.\nSearch engines, social media platforms and other online sources often revise their algorithms and introduce new advertising products. If one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for website traffic were to modify its general methodology for how it displays our advertisements, resulting in fewer consumers clicking through to our websites, our business could suffer. In addition, if our online display advertisements are no longer effective or are not able to reach certain diners due to diners\u2019 use of ad-blocking software, our business could suffer.\nIf one or more of the search engines or other online sources on which we rely for purchased listings modifies or terminates its relationship with us, our expenses could rise, we could lose consumers and traffic to our websites could decrease, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of senior management or key operating personnel could adversely affect our operations. We depend on skilled personnel to grow and operate our business, and our failure to hire, retain or attract key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on our executive officers, senior management team and other key operating and technology personnel. As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive advantage. If for any reason the services of our key personnel were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. While we have entered into an employment agreement with our chief executive officer through 2021, the rest of our executive team has entered into at-will employment arrangements. We believe that equity inducements issued to our executive team in connection with employment properly incentivizes our team to maintain employment.\nWe could face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel, particularly in larger markets into which we may expand. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively. Retaining and attracting key talent is extremely competitive in the high\ntechnology industry, particularly in the areas of mobile applications and Internet technology. If we are unable to retain or attract key talent or personnel, our operations could suffer, thereby materially adversely affecting our business.\nMajor hurricanes, tropical cyclones, major snow and/or ice storms in areas not accustomed to them and other instances of severe weather and other natural phenomena could cause significant losses.\nOur services and operations are subject to interruption, decreases in consumer entertainment spending and damage and destruction to company property as a result of severe local weather conditions or other natural phenomena. Our headquarters are located in areas that have historically been and could, in the future, be materially and adversely affected by damage resulting from a major tropical cyclone, significant rain event, a hurricane, or other severe weather phenomena. In addition, we rely on third parties for critical infrastructure and services. Any of these third parties could be subject to disruptions due to similar major weather events, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may also suffer from weather-related or other events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, widespread computer viruses, terrorist attacks, acts of war and explosions, which may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy our assets or the assets of our customers or otherwise adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers (both restaurant and diner), any of which could adversely affect our results or make our results more volatile. In addition, third parties that provide critical technology, services and infrastructure, such as data centers, telecommunications networks and the like remain vulnerable to these types of events, all of which could disrupt critical services for us, adversely affecting our financial results and operations.\nSuch adverse weather occurrences could materially impact orders on the Platforms and delivery capabilities of independent contractor drivers, thus severely decreasing our revenue and increasing costs. Further, in the event of any such weather occurrence, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the costs of repairing or replacing damaged equipment and we may suffer a significant decline in revenues if any of the restaurants on the Platforms are closed for an extended period of time or these events result in significant disruption to telecommunications systems, including the Internet or mobile phone services. Any such events could materially and adversely affect our business and the results of our operations.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders and harm our business and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have effected, and may continue to effect, acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, products, and technologies. Our ability to acquire and successfully integrate larger or more complex companies, products, and technologies is unproven. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. Our competitors have large cash reserves and aggressive acquisition strategies, and we may not be able to successfully attract acquisition targets to the same degree as our competitors. Our previous and future acquisitions may not achieve our goals, and any future acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by diners, restaurants, or investors. In addition, if we fail to close transactions successfully or integrate new teams, or integrate the products and technologies associated with these acquisitions into our company and culture, our business could be seriously harmed. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. We may not successfully evaluate or use the acquired products, technology, and personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities that we assume as a result of acquiring companies. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition, any of which could seriously harm our business. Selling equity to finance any such acquisitions would also dilute our stockholders. Incurring debt would increase our fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our operations.\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property. We do not currently hold any issued patents. In the future, we may acquire patents or patent portfolios, which could require significant cash expenditures. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business.\nWe have registered the trademark \u201cWaitr,\u201d along with its stylized logo, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Waiter.com, Inc. sued Waitr Incorporated in 2016 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana alleging, among other things, trademark infringement based on the use of the name \u201cWaitr.\u201d Although we believe that Waiter.com, Inc.\u2019s lawsuit lacks merit, there is a risk that the court could find that our use of the name \u201cWaitr\u201d infringes the rights of Waiter.com, Inc. In such event, the court could award Waiter.com, Inc. significant damages and/or order that we discontinue our use of the name \u201cWaitr.\u201d Any such adverse ruling or finding could materially adversely affect our financial results and operations. Having to use a different name could confuse restaurants and/or diners, resulting in fewer orders.\nWe are currently party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompanies in the Internet, technology, and mobile application industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \u201cnon-practicing entities\u201d that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce new products, including in areas where we currently do not compete, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.\nAs a public company, we may receive letters demanding that we cease and desist using certain intellectual property. Some of these may result in litigation against us. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation costs large amounts of money and time and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Favorable final outcomes do not occur in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. For example, a ruling in the lawsuit filed by Waiter.com, Inc. could require that we stop using the name Waitr. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, names or practices or discontinue the practices.\nThe development of alternative non-infringing technology, names or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability and expenses for legal claims from the normal course of business activities.\nWaitr is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business activities, including, without limitation, labor and employment claims, lawsuits and claims involving personal injuries, physical damage and workers\u2019 compensation benefits suffered as a result of alleged conduct involving its employees, independent contractor drivers, and third-party negligence. Although Waitr maintains insurance that it believes generally covers liability for potential damages in many of these matters, insurance coverage is not guaranteed, often these claims are met with denial of coverage positions by the carriers, and there are limits to insurance coverage; accordingly, we could suffer material losses as a result of these claims or the denial of coverage for such claims.\nOur use of open source software could expose us to \u201ccopyleft\u201d claims or otherwise subject us to business or legal risk.\nWe use open source software in our products. Our use of open source software in our products may require us to license innovations that are material to our business and may also expose us to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. Insufficient capital can harm our operating, business and financial results.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our growth and may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including to increase our marketing expenditures to improve brand awareness, develop new product and service offerings or further improve the Platforms and existing product and service offerings, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Volatility in the credit markets also may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our employees were to unionize, our operating costs could increase and our ability to compete could be impaired.\nNone of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement. However, we always face the risk that our employees may try to unionize, and if our independent contractors were ever reclassified as employees, the magnitude of this risk would increase. Further, Congress or one or more states could approve legislation and/or the National Labor Relations Board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with employees and independent contractors, including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization. In addition, we can offer no assurance that the National Labor Relations Board will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions.\nAny attempt to organize by our employees could result in increased legal and other associated costs and divert management attention, and if we entered into a collective bargaining agreement, the terms could negatively affect our costs, efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations. In particular, the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects because:\n\u2022\nRestrictive work rules could hamper our efforts to improve and sustain operating efficiency and could impair our service reputation and limit our ability to provide our services;\n\u2022\nA strike or work stoppage could negatively impact our profitability and could damage customer and employee relationships; and\n\u2022\nAn election and bargaining process could divert management\u2019s time and attention from our overall objectives and impose significant expenses.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting effective January 1, 2021 and may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and our business and results of operations may suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing and other competitive pressures.\nWe compete with many traditional and online and mobile app ordering and general delivery companies of varying sizes, including many that have greater access to restaurants, a wider range of services, a wider range of menu or delivery items, greater capital resources, or other competitive advantages. Traditional ordering techniques involve advertising by restaurants in low-cost paper publications and through traditional online and offline media channels, with consumers simply calling restaurants or delivery services to place orders. Traditional takeout or delivery services are often lower cost than the Platforms and are difficult to disrupt. We also compete with smaller, regional and local companies that cover specific locations with specific restaurants or that offer niche services. We also compete, to a lesser extent, with restaurants that hire their own delivery drivers for online, mobile application or telephone orders. Numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain or improve our profitability. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nMany of our competitors\u2019 periodically reduce or eliminate their delivery charges to consumers or commissions that they charge to restaurants to gain business, especially during times of increased competition or reduced growth in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase our order commissions and delivery charges, may require us to reduce our order commissions and delivery charges or may limit our ability to maintain or expand our business;\n\u2022\nSome restaurants have reduced or may reduce the number of mobile app or online ordering and delivery services and technologies that they use by selecting a single core company or a limited number of providers as approved service providers and, in some instances, we may not be selected;\n\u2022\nRestaurants could solicit bids from multiple service providers for their mobile application or online ordering and delivery needs, which may depress service fees and commission rates or result in a loss of business to competitors;\n\u2022\nThe continuing trend toward consolidation in the online and mobile app ordering and delivery industry could result in larger companies with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages, and we may have difficulty competing with them;\n\u2022\nAdvances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our restaurant diners and consumers may not be willing to accept higher service fees, commission rates or delivery charges to cover the cost of these investments;\n\u2022\nHigher fuel prices and, in turn, higher fuel surcharges may cause some of the independent contractor drivers to demand higher independent contractor driver rates;\n\u2022\nCompetition from \u201cgig economy\u201d companies in general may negatively impact independent contractor driver, restaurant customer and/or consumer relationships and service rates;\n\u2022\nRestaurants could develop their own online or mobile app ordering and delivery technology and hire their own drivers to make their own deliveries, which could reduce demand for our services to restaurants and limit choices for consumers, reducing the number and frequency of orders using our technology; and\n\u2022\nContinued debate and uncertainty in various jurisdictions regarding gig economy companies\u2019 treatment of drivers as independent contractors, which could increase our independent contractor expenses in future periods.\nOur business depends on discretionary spending patterns in the areas in which the restaurants on our Platforms operate and in the economy at large. Economic downturns or other events (like coronavirus or similar widespread health/pandemic outbreaks) impacting the United States and global economy could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nPurchases at restaurants and food and beverage hospitality services locations are discretionary for consumers and we are therefore susceptible to changes in discretionary spending patterns or economic slowdowns in the geographic areas in which restaurants on our Platforms operate and in the economy at large. We believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases, including delivery, dine-in or carryout of restaurant meals, during favorable economic conditions. Disruptions in the overall economy (including disruptions due to coronavirus or similar health/pandemic events), including high unemployment, financial market volatility and unpredictability, and the related reduction in consumer confidence, could negatively affect food and beverage sales throughout the restaurant industry, including orders through the Platforms. In addition, we believe that a proportion of our weekday revenues, particularly during the lunch hour, historically have been derived from business customers using expense accounts. Our business therefore may be affected by reduced expense account or other business-related dining by business clientele. There is also a risk that if uncertain economic conditions persist for an extended period of time or worsen, consumers might make long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including ordering food for delivery, dine-in or carryout less frequently. The ability of the U.S. economy to handle this uncertainty is likely to be affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. These factors, including national, regional and local politics and economic conditions, continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable consumer income and consumer confidence, also\naffect discretionary consumer spending. If any of these factors cause restaurants to cease operations or cease using the Platforms, it could also significantly harm our financial results, for the reasons set forth elsewhere in these risk factors. Continued uncertainty in or a worsening of the economy, generally or in a number of our markets, and diners\u2019 reactions to these trends could adversely affect our business and cause us to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new market openings or cease operations in existing markets.\nOur industry is affected by general economic and business risks that are largely beyond our control.\nOur industry is highly cyclical, and our business is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that some of the most significant of these factors are economic changes that affect supply and demand in dining out in general, such as:\n\u2022\nchanges in diners\u2019 dining habits and in the availability of disposable income for ordering food from restaurants;\n\u2022\nexcess restaurant capacity in comparison with food order demand;\n\u2022\ndownturns in restaurants\u2019 business cycles;\n\u2022\nrecessionary economic cycles, downturns or other events (like the COVID-19 or similar widespread health/pandemic outbreaks); and\n\u2022\nclosure of restaurants and economic impact on diners as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe risks associated with these factors are heightened when the U.S. and/or global economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks during such times are as follows:\n\u2022\nWe may experience low overall food and beverage order levels because our diners\u2019 demand for our services generally correlate with the strength of the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, global economy;\n\u2022\nCertain of the restaurants on our Platforms may face credit issues and cash flow problems, particularly if they encounter increased financing costs, decreased access to capital or loss of customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may decrease diner demand for restaurant prepared food, and such issues and problems may affect the number of orders that occur through the Platforms;\n\u2022\nFood ordering and dining out patterns may change as food supply chains are redesigned and customer tastes change, resulting in an imbalance between restaurants\u2019 available menu items and the demands of Active Diners;\n\u2022\nDiners may select competitors that offer lower delivery charges, commission rates or other charges from among existing choices in an attempt to lower their costs, and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose restaurants offering food or diners ordering food through the Platforms; and\n\u2022\nDisruptive health events or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental regulatory response in connection therewith, may have significant, negative economic effects on the geographic areas in which we operate, which may include impacts to ordering, carryout, dine-in or delivery habits, availability of independent contractor delivery drivers, and restaurants\u2019 ability to receive and prepare food. Additionally, many of our markets include colleges or universities whose populations fluctuate between semesters. Temporary closures or suspension of semesters by colleges and universities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or other health events may have a material adverse effect upon our operations and financial results.\nWe are also subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, compensation to independent contractor drivers, interest rates, taxes, license and registration fees, insurance, payment processing and other technology related fees, and the costs of healthcare for our employees.\nThe business levels of restaurants on the Platforms also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints, which could lead to disruptions in the availability of popular order items, reducing use of the Platforms. A significant interruption in our normal order levels could disrupt our operations, increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our diners.\nIn addition, events outside our control, such as strikes or other work stoppages at our facilities, or actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements could lead to reduced economic demand, reduced availability of credit or ordering capabilities of\nthe Platforms. Such events or enhanced security measures in connection with such events could impair our operations and result in higher operating costs.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our operations.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Waitr has thus far been able to operate effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the potential impacts and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and on the Company\u2019s business, in particular, are uncertain and may be difficult to assess or predict. The pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce the Company\u2019s ability to access capital and continue to operate effectively. The COVID-19 pandemic could also reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services or result in restaurant closures, and a prolonged recession or additional financial market corrections resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s services. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in this Form 10-K. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 global outbreak and lifting of any restrictions, although there remains significant uncertainty related to the public health and economic situation in both the United States and globally.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several jurisdictions have implemented or are considering implementing fee caps, fee disclosure requirements and similar measures that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nIn an attempt to provide relief to restaurants which have been materially and adversely impacted by closures and other governmental limitations placed on restaurant and bar activities because of the COVID-19 pandemic, several jurisdictions across the United States have implemented caps on restaurant fees charged by local food delivery logistics platforms. Thus far, these fee caps have been implemented in relatively few jurisdictions where we have operations, are temporary in nature, and have not resulted in a material impact on our results of operations. With the continued duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, these existing fee caps could persist for at least the near term. In addition, other jurisdictions where we operate are currently considering similar caps and others may decide to implement similar caps. If fee caps, fee disclosure requirements or similar measures are more broadly implemented in jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected in the near term. There is also a risk that fee caps could be retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and could have an ongoing adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nWe rely on restaurants in our network for many aspects of our business, and their failure to maintain their service levels could harm our business.\nDiners demand quality food at reasonable prices. The ability of diners to obtain such quality food from restaurants they like on a timely basis through the Platforms drives the primary value of the Platforms. Our ability to provide diners with a high-quality and compelling ordering experience depends, in part, on diners receiving competitive prices, convenience, customer service and responsiveness from restaurants from whom they order. If these restaurants do not meet or exceed diner expectations with competitive levels of convenience, customer service, price and responsiveness, the value of our brands may be harmed, our ability to attract new diners to the Platforms may be limited and the number of diners placing orders through the Platforms may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, if restaurants face challenges or difficulties set forth elsewhere in these risk factors, the number of restaurants on the Platforms could decline, the price of food could increase or customer service levels could suffer, all of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf use of the Internet via websites, mobile devices and other platforms, particularly with respect to online ordering, does not continue to increase as rapidly as we anticipate, our business and growth prospects may be harmed.\nOur business and growth prospects substantially depend upon the continued and increasing use of the Internet and mobile telecommunications as an effective medium of transactions by diners. Orders on the Platforms are conducted using the Internet and/or mobile networks. Historical rates of growth and adoption in Internet and mobile wireless communications may not predict future rates of growth or adoption. Diners or restaurants may not continue to use the Internet or mobile networking services to order their food at current or increased growth rates or at all. Consumers in our industry (and in others) may reject the use of the Internet and mobile applications as a viable platform or resource for a number of reasons in the future, including:\n\u2022\nactual or perceived lack of security of information or privacy protection;\n\u2022\npossible disruptions, computer viruses or other damage to Internet servers, users\u2019 computers or mobile applications;\n\u2022\nexcessive governmental regulation; and\n\u2022\nunacceptable delays due to actual or perceived limitations of wireless networks.\nThe nature of our business and content on the Platforms exposes us to potential liability and expenses for legal claims that could materially affect our results of operations and business.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims and harm to our business relating to the nature of the delivery, dine-in and carryout food business, including potential claims related to food offerings, delivery and quality. For example, third parties have in the past and could in the future assert legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to food poisoning or tampering or accidents caused by the independent contractor delivery drivers. Alternatively, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages by restaurants on our Platforms to underage diners.\nReports of food-borne illnesses, whether true or not, could adversely impact the results of our operations regardless of whether our diners actually suffer such illnesses from orders on the Platforms. Food-borne illnesses and other food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past and could occur in the future. In addition, consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of foods provided on the Platforms, even if those concerns do not directly relate to food items available on the Platforms. A negative report or negative publicity, whether related to a restaurant on one of our Platforms or to a competitor in the industry, may have an adverse impact on demand for the restaurants\u2019 food and could result in decreased diner orders on the Platforms. A decrease in orders or Active Diners as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our brands, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple markets for our services would be affected rather than a single market. We cannot assure that all food items will be properly maintained during delivery to diners or that the independent contractor drivers will identify food that is problematic upon pickup. If diners become ill from food-borne illnesses, we and/or restaurants on our Platforms could be forced to temporarily suspend service. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not they are related to us, could subject us or restaurants to regulation by applicable governmental authorities.\nWe face the prospect of liabilities and expenses relating to the content and other information that we publish on the Platforms, third-party sites and/or relating to our marketing efforts. We could face claims based on the violation of intellectual property rights, such as copyright infringement claims based on the unauthorized use of menu content or other items. Although we typically obtain a restaurant\u2019s consent to publish their menu items prior to posting them on the Platforms, we may not always be successful in obtaining such consent. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. If any of these events occur, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to legal claims. The frequency of such claims is unpredictable. We have experienced diversion of attention by management to address these claims, and such claims can result in significant costs to investigate and defend, regardless of the merits of such claims. The potentially significant number and dollar amount of claims could materially affect our results of operations and harm our business.\nOur storage, processing and use of data, some of which contains personal information, subjects us to complex and evolving federal and state laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, any of which could seriously harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve matters central to our business, including user privacy, sweepstakes, rewards or coupons, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, e-commerce, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, libel, defamation, internet or data usage, and online-payment services. These laws and regulations constantly evolve and remain subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because we store, process, and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal and state laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in diner and restaurant growth, orders, retention, or engagement, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nindustry or general market conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international political and economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022\naction by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including sales of large blocks of common stock;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges in investor perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws, rules or regulations, regulatory actions affecting us and other dynamics; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility over time that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has sometimes been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares by existing stockholders could cause our share price to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The registration statement registering our securities issued in connection with the Landcadia Business Combination and Bite Squad Merger became effective on February 14, 2019, and all such securities registered thereby, except for shares of common stock subject to transfer restrictions, are eligible to be sold into the public market, subject to compliance with the Company\u2019s insider trading policy for such parties that are covered thereby. Significant sales of our common stock could cause our share price to decline.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or fixed maturity securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, and litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution of the percentage ownership of the holders of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their shareholdings in us.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation as currently in effect (the \u201cCharter\u201d) discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur Charter includes a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us. For example, our Charter includes the following provisions:\n\u2022\na staggered board providing for three classes of directors, which limits the ability of a stockholder or group to gain control of our Board;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board to issue preferred stock, which could contain features that delay or prevent a change of control;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of our Board, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the removal of directors by the stockholders be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 75% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, which limits the ability of stockholders to remove directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the adoption, amendment, alteration or repeal of the bylaws by stockholders be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors and the requirement that the amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, which limit the ability of stockholders to effect corporate governance changes; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur Charter may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and federal court within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that the Company\u2019s stockholders may initiate, which could limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees.\nOur Charter provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and federal court within the State of Delaware will be exclusive forums for any:\n\u2022\nderivative action or proceeding brought on the Company\u2019s behalf;\n\u2022\naction asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees to the Company or its stockholders;\n\u2022\naction asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Charter or our Bylaws; or\n\u2022\nother action asserting a claim against the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of the Company\u2019s Charter described above. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company\nor its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of the Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nThe Debt Warrants, Notes and other Derivative Securities are exercisable/convertible into shares of our common stock, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe issued Debt Warrants to Luxor Capital in connection with the Debt Facility. The Debt Warrants are currently exercisable for 399,726 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $12.51 per share. In addition, the Notes are convertible into up to 3,957,164 shares of common stock. In 2020, we issued an option to our chief executive officer to purchase 9,572,397 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.37 per share, as well as restricted stock grants to our executives. The shares of common stock issued upon exercise of these derivative securities (and restricted stock grants) and/or conversion of the Notes will result in dilution to the then existing holders of common stock of the Company and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Other equity-based awards were issued in 2020 that also could result in dilution and increased shares also eligible for resale in the public market. See Part II, Item 8, Note 9 - Debt, for the definitions of Debt Facility, Notes and Luxor Capital, Part II, Item 8, Note 13 - Stock-Based Awards and Cash-Based Awards for a description of Mr. Grimstad\u2019s option and other awards, and Part II, Item 8, Note 14 - Stockholders\u2019 Equity, for the definition of Debt Warrants.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur Charter authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16173, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "WTRH"}
