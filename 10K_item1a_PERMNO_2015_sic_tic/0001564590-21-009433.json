{"cik": "851520", "company": "EXPONENT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nExponent operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those mentioned elsewhere in this report and those set forth below. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated.\nRisks Related to Our Clients and Demand for Our Services\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected our operations and those of our clients. The duration and extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our future financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition and results of operations due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures, compliance with these measures has impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our operations.\nThe vast majority of our employees have been working remotely since the implementation of government measures to contain the virus. These remote working arrangements may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs and risks. In addition, most of our clients are also working remotely, which may delay the initiation of new projects and the execution of on-going work. Many of our litigation support projects paused due to courthouse closures and associated legal delays. Travel restrictions have delayed work that requires inspection of a site or a product that cannot be shipped. The pandemic has also negatively impacted our ability to conduct user studies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn and has caused volatility in financial markets, which could affect demand for our services and impact our financial condition and results of operations even after the pandemic is contained and the containment measures are lifted. For example, we\nmay be unable to collect receivables from those customers significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, stock repurchases, dividends and other liquidity requirements over at least the next 12 months. However, we continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flows and on the credit and financial markets.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees and clients. There can be no assurance, however, that the ultimate impact on our financial condition and results of operations will not be material. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business.\nThe unpredictable and reactive nature of our business can create uneven performance in any given quarter or year.\nRevenues are primarily derived from services provided in response to client requests or events that occur without notice, and engagements, generally billed as services are performed, are terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by clients. As a result, backlog at any particular time is small in relation to our quarterly or annual revenues and is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods. Revenues and operating margins for any particular quarter are generally affected by staffing mix, resource requirements and timing and size of engagements.\nOur financial results could suffer if our clients\u2019 needs change more rapidly than we are able to secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel.\nAs our clients\u2019 needs change, new technologies develop, and legal and regulatory processes change, we may be unable to timely hire or train personnel with the appropriate new set of skills and experience which could negatively impact our growth and profitability.\nThe loss of a large client could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients in the chemical, construction, consumer products, energy, life sciences and transportation industries. The loss of any large client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur clients may be unable to pay for our services.\nIf a client's financial difficulties become severe, the client may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable and unbilled services. The COVID-19 pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn, which may impact the ability of our customers to pay for our services. On occasion, some of our clients have entered bankruptcy, which has prevented us from collecting amounts owed to us. The bankruptcy of a client with substantial accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on our professional reputation.\nThe professional reputation of Exponent and its consultants is critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals. Proven or unproven allegations against us may damage our professional reputation. Any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business can be adversely impacted by deregulation or reduced regulatory enforcement.\nPublic concern over health, safety and preservation of the environment has resulted in the enactment of a broad range of environmental and/or other laws and regulations by local, state and federal lawmakers and agencies. These laws and the implementation of new regulations affect nearly every industry, as well as the agencies of federal, state and local governments charged with their enforcement. To the extent changes in such laws, regulations and enforcement or other factors significantly reduce the exposures of manufacturers, owners, service providers and others to liability, the demand for our services may be significantly reduced.\nTort reform can reduce demand for our services.\nSeveral of our practices have a significant concentration in litigation support consulting services. To the extent tort reform reduces the exposure of manufacturers, owners, service providers and others to liability, the demand for our litigation support consulting services may be significantly reduced.\nPotential conflicts of interest may preclude us from accepting some engagements.\nWe provide litigation support consulting and other services primarily in connection with significant disputes, or other matters that are usually adversarial or that involve sensitive client information. The nature of our consulting services has and will continue to preclude us from accepting engagements with other potential clients because of conflicts. Accordingly, the nature of our business limits the number of both potential clients and potential engagements.\nInherent risks related to government contracts may adversely affect our business.\nWe work for various United States and foreign governmental entities and agencies. Government entities reserve the right to audit our contracts and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts. Findings from an audit may result in fees being refunded to the government or prospective adjustment to previously agreed upon rates that will affect future margins. If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of the government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities, regardless of the adequacy of such controls. Government contracts, and the proceedings surrounding them, are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts. Negative publicity related to our government contracts, regardless of whether it is accurate, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts.\nGovernments may terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion.\nUnder our government contracts, the client generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience. Any decision by the client not to exercise contract options or to terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues, revenue growth and profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nFailure to attract and retain key employees may adversely affect our business.\nExponent\u2019s business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor-intensive. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Qualified personnel are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. We cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly qualified technical and managerial personnel and retain existing employees. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience employee turnover. The loss of key managerial employees, business generators or any significant number of employees could have a material adverse impact on our business, including our ability to secure and complete engagements.\nOur engagements may result in professional or other liability.\nOur services typically involve difficult engineering and scientific assignments and carry risks of professional and other liability. Many of our engagements involve matters that could have a severe impact on a client's business, cause a client to lose significant amounts of money, or prevent a client from pursuing desirable business opportunities. Accordingly, if a client is dissatisfied with our performance, the client could threaten or bring litigation in order to recover damages or to contest its obligation to pay our fees. Litigation alleging that we performed negligently, disclosed client confidential information, lost or damaged evidence, infringed on patents, were forced to withdraw from a legal matter due to a conflict or otherwise breached our obligations to a client could expose us to significant liabilities to our clients or other third parties or tarnish our reputation.\nWe are subject to unpredictable risks of litigation.\nAlthough we seek to avoid litigation whenever possible, from time to time we are party to various lawsuits and claims. Disputes may arise, for example, from employment issues, regulatory actions, business acquisitions and real estate and other commercial transactions. There can be no assurances that any lawsuits or claims will be immaterial in the future. Any material lawsuits or claims could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to security breaches that may disrupt our operations and/or lead to the inability to protect confidential information.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to be subjected to, security breaches and threats, none of which have been material to us to date. Despite the implementation of security and business continuity measures, our information technology infrastructure and networks are vulnerable to electronic breaches of security. Such breaches could lead to disruptions of our operations and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential and/or personal information, which could result in legal claims or proceedings. While we have taken reasonable steps to prevent and mitigate the damage of a security breach by continuously improving our design and coordination of security controls across our business, those steps may not be effective and there can be no assurance that any such steps can be effective against all possible risks.\nFailure to protect client and employee data may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe manage, utilize, and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data and protected health information. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and international laws such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In addition, many states, U.S. federal governmental authorities and non-U.S. jurisdictions have adopted, proposed, or are considering adopting or proposing, additional data security and/or data privacy statutes or regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. In addition, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and their related revenue in the future. Our remote working arrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the risks associated with protecting client and employee data.\nOur international operations create special risks that could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our offices in the United States, we have physical offices in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Ireland, and Canada, and conduct business in several other countries. We expect to continue to expand globally and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future. Our international operations carry special financial, business and legal risks, including cultural and language differences; employment laws and related factors that could result in lower utilization, higher staffing costs, and cyclical fluctuations of utilization and revenues; currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results; burdensome regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business; tariffs/trade disputes and other trade barriers including the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union; managing the risks associated with engagements with foreign officials and governmental agencies, including the risks arising from the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010; managing the risks associated with global privacy and data security laws and regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe; greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations; successful entry and execution in new markets; restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; potentially adverse tax consequences; other impending legislation that could add additional risks to the business; and the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions on business activity, which vary significantly by region.\nWe could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if people or properties are harmed by the products and systems we sell or the services we offer.\nWe, on occasion, design, develop, manufacture, sell, service and maintain various products and systems. In some instances, we also train operators of such products and systems. Many of these products and systems utilize software algorithms that are probabilistic in nature and subject to significant technical limitations. There are many factors, some of which are beyond our control, which could result in the failure of our products or systems. The failure of our products or systems could lead to injury, death, or extensive property damage and may lead to product liability, professional liability, or other claims against us. Further, if our products or systems fail, or are perceived to have failed, the negative publicity from such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGeneral Risks\nCompetition could reduce our pricing and adversely affect our business.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive. In addition, there are relatively low barriers to entry into our markets and we have faced, and expect to continue to face, additional competition from new entrants into our markets. Competitive pressure could reduce the market acceptance of our services and result in price reductions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe hold substantial investments that could present liquidity risks.\nOur cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of January 1, 2021 consisted primarily of obligations of the U.S. Treasury. We follow an established investment policy to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.\nInvestments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns. As of January 1, 2021, we had no impairment charge associated with our investment portfolio relating to such adverse financial market conditions. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has a low risk of impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired.\nImpairment of goodwill may require us to record a significant charge to earnings.\nOn our balance sheet as of January 1, 2021, we have $8,607,000 of goodwill subject to periodic evaluation for impairment. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at reporting units, the loss of key employees, changes to the scope of operations of our business or a significant and sustained decline in our stock price could result in goodwill impairment charges. During times of financial market volatility, significant judgment is required to determine the underlying cause of the decline and whether stock price declines are short-term in nature or indicative of an event or change in circumstances.\nImpairment of long-lived assets or restructuring activities may require us to record a significant charge to earnings.\nOur long-lived assets, including our office, laboratory and warehouse space in Menlo Park, California, our test and engineering center in Phoenix, Arizona, and our office and laboratory facilities in Natick, Massachusetts, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at the asset group level could result in impairment of our long-lived assets. In addition, we have operating lease commitments for office and laboratory space. Changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of operations of our business. These changes, including the closure of one or more offices, could result in restructuring and/or asset impairment charges. The COVID-19 pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn, which increases the risk of long-lived asset impairment charges.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.\nOur business can be adversely affected by downturns in the overall economy.\nThe markets that we serve are cyclical and subject to general economic conditions. The direction and relative strength of the global economy continues to be uncertain. If economic growth in the United States, where we primarily operate, slows, our clients may consolidate or go out of business and thus demand for our services could be reduced significantly.\nOur quarterly results may vary.\nVariations in our revenues and operating results occur from time to time, as a result of a number of factors, such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter, the timing of engagements, the number of working days in a quarter, employee hiring and utilization rates, and integration of companies acquired. Because a high percentage of our expenses, particularly personnel and facilities related expenses, are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter, a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of our client assignments can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nMany factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall. These include the risk factors listed above and below; changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts; future sales of shares of common stock in the public market; market conditions in the industry and economy as a whole; acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors; restatement of financial results; and changes in accounting principles or methods. In addition, the stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When the market price of a company's stock drops significantly, shareholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company. Any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the time and attention of our management and other resources, or otherwise harm our business.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts.\nOur Board of Directors has declared quarterly dividends since March 2013. Our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and, in the case of dividends, periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. Future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments, including acquisitions; legal risks; stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchase activity could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nWe rely on our network infrastructure and certain third-party hosted services to support our operations. A disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change may disrupt our business.\nThe areas where we conduct business are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For example, in California, wildfire danger increases the probability of planned power outages which may impact our employees\u2019 abilities to commute to work and to stay connected. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business.", "PERMNO": 76261, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "EXPO"}
