The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the financial statements and the related notes. Please read \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this filing, where we describe additional uncertainties associated with our business and the forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this filing.\nOur securities should only be purchased by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment in us. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information in this filing before deciding to become a holder of our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be negatively affected to a significant extent.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations and Industry\nWe will require substantial additional funding, and our failure to raise additional capital necessary to support and expand our operations could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had $0.76 million in cash. Our primary sources of cash for the year ended March 31, 2018 were from funds generated from the sale of preferred stock, the sale of oil and gas properties and the sale of natural gas (including NGL) and crude oil production, and funds borrowed under funding agreements.\nWe do not currently have all of the financial resources to fully develop and execute on all of our other business opportunities, nor do we have all of the resources to satisfy our debt obligations including the loan agreement with International Bank of Commerce (\u201cIBC\u201d or \u201cIBC Bank\u201d), which is currently in default. We intend to finance our development through our producing assets, equity or debt financings and by securing financial and strategic partners focused on development of these opportunities. We can make no assurances that our business operations will provide us with sufficient cash flows to continue our operations. We will need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financing for any new ventures that are developed, for debt services, to support our existing projects and possible expansions thereof and for our corporate general and administrative expenses. We may consider a full range of financing options in order to develop our business.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all. Any such financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels; (ii) successfully develop our assets; (iii) fund certain obligations as they become due; (iv) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements; or (v) repay our indebtedness. If we fail to repay or refinance the loan agreement with IBC Bank, which is currently in default, then we may be forced to sell our assets which are secured by the loan agreement with IBC Bank in order to satisfy the outstanding debt or take other remedial steps. If IBC Bank were to foreclose on the assets which secure the IBC Bank debt we may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, the result of which will likely be, among other things, that any securities in the Company become worthless.\nWe require significant additional financing to continue as a going concern and pay outstanding liabilities and our lack of available funding raises questions regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDue to the nature of oil and gas interests, i.e., that rates of production generally decline over time as oil and gas reserves are depleted, if we are unable to drill additional wells and develop our proved undeveloped reserves (\u201cPUDs\u201d), either because we are unable to raise sufficient funding for such development activities, or otherwise, or in the event we are unable to acquire additional operating properties; we believe that our revenues will continue to decline over time. Furthermore, in the event we are unable to raise additional funding in the future we will not be able to participate in the drilling of planned additional wells, will not be able to complete other drilling and/or workover activities, and may not be able to make required payments on our outstanding liabilities, including amounts owed on the loan agreement with IBC Bank. Therefore, in the event we do not raise additional funding in the future we will be forced to scale back our business plan, sell or liquidate assets to satisfy outstanding debts and/or take other steps which may include seeking bankruptcy protection.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The financial statements included herein also include a going concern footnote from our auditors.\nAdditionally, due to our need for immediate funding, we may be forced to raise capital through the sale of debt (subordinated to IBC) or equity in the near term. In order to issue additional convertible debt securities, we must, subject to certain exceptions, obtain the consent of the investor in our April 2016/October 2017 financing. If we are unable to obtain the consent of this investor in connection with future financings, we may be unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If external financing sources are not available in a timely manner or at all, or are inadequate to fund our operations, it could materially harm our financial condition and results of operation. We may not have the time or resources available to seek stockholder approval (if required pursuant to applicable NYSE American rules and requirements) for such transactions which may result in the issuance of more than 20% of our outstanding common stock. As such, we may instead rely on an exemption from the NYSE American stockholder approval rules which allows an NYSE American listed company an exemption from such rules when a delay in securing stockholder approval would seriously jeopardize the financial viability of the Company. Consequently, our stockholders may not be offered the ability to approve transactions we may undertake in the future, including those transactions which would ordinarily require stockholder approval under applicable NYSE American rules and regulations, and/or those transactions which would result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders.\nIn the event we are unable to raise funding in the future or complete a business combination or similar transaction in the near term, we will not be able to pay our liabilities. In the event we are unable to raise adequate funding in the future for our operations and to pay our outstanding debt obligations or in the event we fail to enter into a business combination or similar transaction, we would be forced to liquidate our assets (or our creditors may undertake a foreclosure of such assets in order to satisfy amounts we owe to such creditors) or may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, which could result in the value of our outstanding securities declining in value or becoming worthless.\nWe are currently in default of our $36.9 million loan agreement with IBC Bank, which is secured by substantially all of our assets.\nOn September 8, 2017, the Company received a Notice of Default and Opportunity to Cure (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from IBC, stating that the Company was in default under its loan due to failing to make a required $425,000 loan payment on August 25, 2017 (the \u201cPayment Default\u201d). The Notice was also sent to the guarantors under the Loan Agreement. The Notice also cited the Company for several covenant defaults including exceeding a cap on monthly general and administrative expenses; falling below $30 million of net worth; failing to comply with certain post-closing covenants regarding the assignment of certain oil and gas interests, the execution of certain supplemental mortgages and the completion of certain curative title requirements; failing to pay costs and expenses required pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement; failing to meet the requirements of a cash flow test as described in greater detail in the Loan Agreement; and exceeding the loan to value determination provided for in the Loan Agreement. In order to cure the Payment Default described in the Notice, the Company was required to pay $425,000, as well as any attorney\u2019s fees and/or late fees as determined by IBC, on or before September 18, 2017, which amount was not paid and to cure the covenant defaults, which covenant defaults were not cured.\nPursuant to extension agreements entered into with IBC, in or around December 2017 and January 2018, (a) IBC agreed to waive the Company\u2019s obligation to make the August 30, 2017, $425,000 monthly principal payment originally due under the IBC loan; (b) the Company confirmed the amount outstanding under the IBC loan ($37,443,308 as of each extension); (c) IBC agreed that interest only payments would be due on September 30, 2017, October 30, 2017, November 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, with principal payments of $425,000 per month to begin thereafter, which principal payments were not made; (d) the parties agreed that the amounts owed to IBC were payable on demand, provided that if no demand was made, such amounts would be payable by way of monthly payments of $425,000 of principal, plus accrued interest, with the remaining amount owed to IBC due at maturity (August 25, 2019); (e) that the amount owed to IBC will accrue interest at the rate of 2% per annum above the prime rate, subject to a floor of 5.5% (currently 6.25% per annum); (f) if the Company fails to make any payment due to IBC within 10 days of its due date, IBC is due a late payment of 5% of the amount past due (subject to a minimum of $10 and a maximum of $1,500 per late payment); and (g) the Company and the guarantors of the IBC loan released IBC from any claims against IBC as of the date of each of such extensions.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company was not in compliance with certain covenants of the loan agreement with IBC, including requiring the Company to maintain a net worth of $30 million and had previously defaulted in the payment of certain interest and principal payments which were required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the loan. As a result, the balance of the loan due to IBC of $36.9 million (less unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $1.3 million), was recognized as a short-term liability on the Company\u2019s balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. The Company has also recognized approximately $39,000 in accrued interest as of March 31, 2018.\nNotwithstanding the above extensions, the Company is still in default under the IBC loan, the entire amount of the IBC loan may be accelerated and IBC may take action to enforce its remedies under the loan agreement. The IBC loan is secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets.\nWe have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position.\nWe have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness. As of March 31, 2018, we owed approximately $3 million in accounts payable and $37.4 million in notes payable, of which $36.9 million is the Loan Agreement with IBC (currently in default).\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; restrict us from taking advantage of business opportunities;\n\u2022 make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt obligations; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes in satisfactory terms or at all.\nWe will need to raise additional funding in the future to repay or refinance the IBC Loan Agreement (currently in default as discussed above) and our accounts payable, and as such may need to seek additional debt or equity financing. Such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If debt financing is available and obtained, our interest expense may increase and we may be subject to the risk of default, depending on the terms of such financing. If equity financing is available and obtained it may result in our shareholders experiencing significant dilution. If such financing is unavailable, we may be forced to curtail our operations, which may cause the value of our securities to decline in value and/or become worthless.\nWe are subject to production declines and loss of revenue due to shut-in wells.\nThe majority of our production revenues come from a small number of producing wells. In the event those wells are required to be shut-in (as they were for various periods in the past), our production and revenue could be adversely effected. Our wells are shut-in from time-to-time for maintenance, workovers, upgrades and other matters outside of our control, including repairs, adverse weather (including hurricanes, flooding and tropical storms), inability to dispose of produced water or other regulatory and market conditions. Any significant period where our wells, and especially our top producing wells, are shut-in, would have a material adverse effect on our results of production, revenues and net income or loss for the applicable period.\nMany of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells.\nMany of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset drilling. Interference from offset drilling may inhibit our ability to find or recover commercial quantities of oil and/or may result in an acceleration in the decline in production of our wells, which may in turn have an adverse effect on our recovered barrels of oil and consequently our results of operations.\nCrude oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile in general and low prices will negatively affect our financial results.\nOur revenues, operating results, profitability, cash flow, future rate of growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital, as well as the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties, are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been very volatile, and such markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u25cf overall U.S. and global economic conditions;\n\u25cf weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u25cf seasonal variations in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u25cf consumer demand;\n\u25cf domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf variations in levels of production;\n\u25cf regional price differentials and quality differentials of oil and natural gas; price and quantity of foreign imports of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u25cf the completion of large domestic or international exploration and production projects;\n\u25cf restrictions on exportation of our oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the availability of refining capacity;\n\u25cf the impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u25cf political conditions in or affecting other oil producing and natural gas producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America and Russia; and\n\u25cf domestic and foreign governmental regulations, actions and taxes.\nFurther, oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. Our revenue, profitability, and cash flow depend upon the prices of supply and demand for oil and natural gas, and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. In particular, declines in commodity prices may:\n\u25cf negatively impact the value of our reserves, because declines in oil and natural gas prices would reduce the value and amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;\n\u25cf reduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness, and other corporate purposes; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nBecause of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plans, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. If we expand our activities, development and production, and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the inability to recruit and retain experienced managers, geoscientists, petroleum engineers and landmen could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to execute our business plan in a timely fashion.\nWe face intense competition.\nWe are in direct competition for properties with numerous oil and natural gas companies, drilling and income programs and partnerships exploring various areas of Texas and Oklahoma. Many competitors are large, well-known energy companies, although no single entity dominates the industry. Many of our competitors possess greater financial and personnel resources enabling them to identify and acquire more economically desirable energy producing properties and drilling prospects than us. Additionally, there is competition from other fuel choices to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry. Management believes that a viable marketplace exists for smaller producers of natural gas and crude oil.\nOur competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford or that would require a costly investment by us in order to compete with them more effectively.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies and databases. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, many of our competitors will have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. One or more of the technologies that we will use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete, and we may be adversely affected.\nThe future occurrence or continuance of an event of default under the IBC loan or the acceleration of amounts owed thereunder and/or under other of our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition.\nThe amounts owed to IBC include standard and customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the IBC loan (provided that as described above, we are in breach of certain terms and conditions of the IBC loan and IBC can, at any time, provide us a notice of the occurrence of an event of default thereunder), IBC may declare the entire unpaid balance (as well as any interest, fees and expenses) immediately due and payable under the IBC loan. Additionally, future debt agreements we enter into will likely have standard events of default, provided they may also have non-standard events of default. In the event of an occurrence of an event of default under our future debt agreements, the holder(s) thereof may declare the amounts due thereunder immediately due and payable. Funding to repay such amounts, if required, may not be available timely, on favorable terms, if at all, and if our creditors were to require immediate repayment of the amounts owed, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Specifically, applicable laws protecting endangered species prohibit the harming of endangered or threatened species, provide for habitat protection, and impose stringent penalties for noncompliance. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations, delays, or prohibitions on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nThe derivatives legislation adopted by Congress, and implementation of that legislation by federal agencies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, set forth a new framework for regulating certain derivative products including the commodity hedges of the type that we may elect to use, but many aspects of this law are subject to further rulemaking, will take effect over several years and are currently being challenged and/or rescinded by the current administration. As a result, it is difficult to anticipate the overall impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our ability or willingness to enter into and maintain such commodity hedges and the terms of such hedges. There is a possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act could have a substantial and adverse impact on our ability to enter into and maintain these commodity hedges. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act could result in the implementation of position limits and additional regulatory requirements on derivative arrangements, which could include new margin, reporting and clearing requirements. In addition, this legislation could have a substantial impact on our counterparties and may increase the cost of our derivative arrangements in the future. If these types of commodity hedges become unavailable or uneconomic, our commodity price risk could increase, which would increase the volatility of revenues and may decrease the amount of credit available to us. Any limitations or changes in our use of derivative arrangements could also materially affect our future ability to conduct acquisitions.\nIf we do not hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices, we may be subject to significant reductions in prices. Alternatively, we may use oil and natural gas price hedging contracts, which involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our profitability.\nIn the event that we choose not to hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices by purchasing futures and by using other hedging strategies, we may be subject to significant reduction in prices which could have a material negative impact on our profitability. Alternatively, we may elect to use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking processes. Our operations and future operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations. Currently, the quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints and supply concerns (particularly in some parts of the country). As a result, future availability of water from certain sources used in the past may be limited. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and conditions could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. The federal Clean Water Act, or CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste, into navigable waters or other regulated federal and state waters. Permits or other approvals must be obtained to discharge pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in such waters and wetlands. Uncertainty regarding regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands and other regulated waters has, and will continue to, complicate and increase the cost of obtaining such permits or other approvals. The CWA and analogous state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. Many state discharge regulations, and the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General permits issued by the EPA, prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into coastal waters. While generally exempt under federal programs, many state agencies have also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. There has been recent nationwide concern over earthquakes associated with Class II underground injection control wells, a predominant storage method for crude oil and gas wastewater. It is likely that new rules and regulations will be developed to address these concerns, possibly eliminating access to Class II wells in certain locations, and increasing the cost of disposal in others. Finally, EPA studies have previously focused on various stages of water use in hydraulic fracturing operations. It is possible that, in the future, the EPA will move to more strictly regulate the use of water in hydraulic fracturing operations. While we cannot predict the impact that these changes may have on our business at this time, they may be material to our business, financial condition, and operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal or recycling of water will increase our operating costs and may cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In addition, our inability to meet our water supply needs to conduct our completion operations may impact our business, and any such future laws and regulations could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant amounts of outstanding debt and our operations may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations, which could reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest expenses and adversely impact our operations.\nWe currently have $35.9 million in outstanding debt, net of debt discount. Our ability to make payments on such indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash from our assets. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to repay this indebtedness and to fund other liquidity needs, including capital expenditure requirements. Such indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf a significant portion of our cash flows are required to be used to service such indebtedness;\n\u25cf a high level of debt could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf covenants contained in our agreements governing such outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u25cf a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, our competitors may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing; and\n\u25cf debt covenants may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt. If we cannot service or refinance our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling significant assets, seeking additional equity financing (which will result in additional dilution to stockholders) or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange financing, our assets may be foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of common stock and, when and if converted, will result in additional dilution to our current stockholders.\nAs of the date of this report, we have 408,508 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of common stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the Series B Preferred Stock ($25.00, as may be adjusted for recapitalizations) by the Conversion Price ($87.50, as may be adjusted for recapitalizations)(i.e., on a 0.2857-to-1 basis). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock under certain conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designations of the Series B Preferred Stock. Assuming the conversion of all such shares, this would result in the issuance of 116,717 shares of our common stock.\nAny weakness in internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and lead to a stock price decline.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and report the results in our annual report on Form 10-K, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If material weaknesses arise and they are not remedied, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. Any failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, limit our ability to raise financing or lead to regulatory sanctions, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business or decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIf we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties in the future, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, and may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. We may be unable to locate or make suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and future acquisitions may not be effectively and profitably integrated. Acquisitions involve risks that could divert management resources and/or result in the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired operations. For the reasons above, among others, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.\nIf we make any acquisitions or enter into any business combinations in the future, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we make acquisitions or enter into any business combinations in the future, funding permitting, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired companies\u2019 assets, personnel and operations with our own. Additionally, acquisitions, mergers or business combinations we may enter into in the future could result in a change of control of the Company, and a change in the Board of Directors or officers of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf the difficulty of integrating acquired companies, concepts and operations;\n\u25cf the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n\u25cf change in our business focus and/or management;\n\u25cf difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf the potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u25cf the potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully manage the companies and/or concepts acquired;\n\u25cf the failure to realize efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or\n\u25cf the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired.\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAny acquisition or business combination transaction we enter into in the future could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders, result in one party having majority or significant control over the Company or result in a change in business focus of the Company.\nWe depend significantly upon the continued involvement of our present management.\nWe depend to a significant degree upon the involvement of our management, specifically, our newly appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer, Louis G. Schott, who is in charge of our strategic planning and operations, and our Chief Financial Officer, Robert Schleizer. Our performance and success are dependent to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of Mr. Schott and Mr. Schleizer. We do not believe that Mr. Schott or Mr. Schleizer could be quickly replaced with personnel of equal experience and capabilities, and their successor(s) may not be as effective. If Mr. Schott, Mr. Schleizer, or any of our other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have an active Board of Directors that meets several times throughout the year and is intimately involved in our business and the determination of our operational strategies. Members of our Board of Directors work closely with management to identify potential prospects, acquisitions and areas for further development. If any of our directors resign or become unable to continue in their present role, it may be difficult to find replacements with the same knowledge and experience and as a result, our operations may be adversely affected.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nLeases on natural gas and oil properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Although we seek to actively manage our undeveloped properties, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, natural gas and oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation.\nAs many of our activities are subject to federal, state and local regulation, and as these rules are subject to constant change or amendment, our operations may be adversely affected by new or different government regulations, laws or court decisions applicable to our operations.\nGovernment regulation and liability for environmental matters may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCrude oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, which may be changed from time to time. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of crude oil and natural gas. There are federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment applicable to the development, production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of crude oil and natural gas, byproducts thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with crude oil and natural gas operations. In addition, we may inherit liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFuture increases in our tax obligations; either due to increases in taxes on energy products, energy service companies and exploration activities or reductions in currently available federal income tax deductions with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, may adversely affect our results of operations and increase our operating expenses.\nFederal, state and local governments have jurisdiction in areas where we operate and impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products we sell. There are constant discussions by federal, state and local officials concerning a variety of energy tax proposals, some of which, if passed, would add or increase taxes on energy products, service companies and exploration activities. The passage of any legislation or any other changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could impact or increase the taxes that we are required to pay and consequently adversely affect our results of operations and/or increase our operating expenses.\nThe crude oil and natural gas reserves we report in our SEC filings are estimates and may prove to be inaccurate.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values. The reserves we report in our filings with the SEC now and in the future will only be estimates and such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because of these uncertainties. Reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves depend upon a number of variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas and assumptions concerning effects of regulations by governmental agencies, future crude oil and natural gas prices, future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and work-over and remedial costs. Some or all of these assumptions may in fact vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward adjustment. Actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and such variances may be material.\nAdditionally, \u201cprobable\u201d and \u201cpossible reserve estimates\u201d are considered unproved reserves and as such, the SEC views such estimates to be inherently unreliable, may be misunderstood or seen as misleading to investors that are not \u201cexperts\u201d in the oil or natural gas industry. Unless you have such expertise, you should not place undue reliance on these estimates. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update this information and do not intend to update this information.\nThe calculated present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows as included in our public filings is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on current costs held constant over time without escalation and on commodity prices using an unweighted arithmetic average of first-day-of-the-month index prices, appropriately adjusted, for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used for these estimates and will be affected by factors such as:\n\u25cf actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf actual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u25cf changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor that is required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes under GAAP is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nCrude oil and natural gas development, re-completion of wells from one reservoir to another reservoir, restoring wells to production and exploration, drilling and completing new wells are speculative activities and involve numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs.\nOur growth will be materially dependent upon the success of our future development program. Even considering our business philosophy to avoid wildcat wells, drilling for crude oil and natural gas and reworking existing wells involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive crude oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of exploration, drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; inability to obtain leases on economic terms, where applicable; adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; compliance with governmental requirements; and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment. Furthermore, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to obtain rights to additional producing properties in the future and/or that any properties we obtain rights to will contain commercially exploitable quantities of oil and/or gas.\nDrilling or reworking is a highly speculative activity. Even when fully and correctly utilized, modern well completion techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling do not guarantee that we will find crude oil and/or natural gas in our wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a fluid with or without particulates into a formation at high pressure, thereby creating fractures in the rock and leaving the particulates in the fractures to ensure that the fractures remain open, thereby potentially increasing the ability of the reservoir to produce oil or natural gas. Horizontal drilling involves drilling horizontally out from an existing vertical well bore, thereby potentially increasing the area and reach of the well bore that is in contact with the reservoir. Our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure would have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our overall drilling success rate and/or our drilling success rate for activities within a particular geographic area may decline in the future. We may identify and develop prospects through a number of methods, some of which do not include lateral drilling or hydraulic fracturing, and some of which may be unproven. The drilling and results for these prospects may be particularly uncertain. Our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted prospects will be dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the results of previous development efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of data; the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants, if any, for the drilling of the prospects; the approval of the prospects by other participants, if any, after additional data has been compiled; economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for crude oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews; our financial resources and results; the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects; and the success of our drilling technology.\nThese projects may not be successfully developed and the wells discussed, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive crude oil or natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to find commercially exploitable quantities of oil and natural gas in any properties we may acquire in the future, and/or we are unable to commercially extract such quantities we may find in any properties we may acquire in the future, the value of our securities may decline in value.\nCommodity price declines during 2016 and 2017 resulted in impairment of our oil and gas properties through the year ended March 2017, and future natural gas and oil price declines could result in additional write-downs of the carrying amount of our assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and oil. Declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs, changes in well performance, delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding write-down of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties. During the year ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded impairments totaling $79.1 million, which represented $10.9 million related to proved properties, $18.7 million related to unproved properties, and $49.5 million in conjunction with the Acquisition, primarily due to continued low commodity prices during the fiscal year. During the year ended March 31, 2018, commodity prices for natural gas and oil stemmed the need for significant impairments and the only impairments recorded related to the expiration of leasehold costs ($8 million) and proved properties ($0.1 million).\nWe evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment using the full cost method whereby the carrying value of property and equipment is compared to the \u201cestimated present value\u201d of its proved reserves discounted at a 10-percent interest rate of future net revenues, based on current economic and operating conditions at the end of the period, plus the cost of properties not being amortized, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties included in costs being amortized, less the income tax effects related to book and tax basis differences. In the event that commodity prices decline further, there could be a significant revision in the future.\nBecause of the inherent dangers involved in oil and gas exploration, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages as we conduct our business operations, which could force us to expend a substantial amount of money in connection with litigation and/or a settlement.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to us from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property purchased and leased by us in the future. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could reduce or eliminate the funds available for the purchase of properties and/or property interests, exploration, development or acquisitions or result in the loss of our properties and/or force us to expend substantial monies in connection with litigation or settlements. As such, our current insurance or the insurance that we obtain in the future may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. We cannot predict the availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify our purchase. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. We may elect to self-insure if management believes that the cost of insurance, although available, is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, which could lead to any investment in us declining in value or becoming worthless.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rate of production from our oil and natural gas properties will decline as our reserves are depleted. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our income and cash flow, are highly dependent on our success in (a) efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves on properties owned by us or by other persons or entities and (b) economically finding or acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties. In the future, we may have difficulty acquiring new properties. During periods of low oil and/or natural gas prices, it will become more difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance expansion activities. If we are unable to replace our production, our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies and personnel, including hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel, could adversely affect our ability to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, completion equipment and services, supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our operations. When drilling activity in the United States increases, associated costs typically also increase, including those costs related to drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel and the services and products of other vendors to the industry. These costs may increase, and necessary equipment and services may become unavailable to us at economical prices. Should this increase in costs occur, we may delay drilling activities, which may limit our ability to establish and replace reserves, or we may incur these higher costs, which may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future.\nOur exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the oil and natural gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSpecifically, as an owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) EPA rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. In addition to the U.S. EPA\u2019s rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, we are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers to reduce GHG emissions.\nAdditionally, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level, including possible regulations limiting the ability to dispose of produced waters. Currently, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements. Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements (such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process) and in additional operating restrictions. In addition to the possible federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, some states and local governments have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells, testing of nearby water wells, restrictions on the access to and usage of water and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Such federal and state permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.\nWe will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the transportation and use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of waters, and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater, air quality and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. Additional legislation or regulation could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing, cause operational delays, increase our operating costs or make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. New legislation or regulations in the future could have the effect of prohibiting the use of hydraulic fracturing, which would prevent us from completing our wells as planned and would have a material adverse effect on production from our wells. If these legislative and regulatory initiatives cause a material delay or decrease in our drilling or hydraulic fracturing activities, our business and profitability could be materially impacted.\nPossible regulation related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for oil and gas.\nStudies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have begun adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or have begun considering adopting greenhouse gas regulatory programs. At the federal level, Congress has considered legislation that could establish a cap and trade system for restricting greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. The ultimate outcome of this federal legislative initiative remains uncertain. In addition to pending climate legislation, the EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an \u201cEndangerment Finding\u201d under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding that greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as a first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. Moreover, the EPA has begun regulating greenhouse gas emission from certain facilities pursuant to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the Clean Air Act. In the courts, several decisions have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by government entities and private parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property. Any existing or future laws or regulations that restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating and compliance costs. In addition, such laws and regulations may adversely affect demand for the fossil fuels we produce, including by increasing the cost of combusting fossil fuels and by creating incentives for the use of alternative fuels and energy.\nThe lack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, insurance, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies tend to increase, in some cases substantially. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases within a geographic area. If increasing levels of exploration and production result in response to strong prices of oil and natural gas, the demand for oilfield services will likely rise, and the costs of these services will likely increase, while the quality of these services may suffer. The future lack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs, as well as any future lack of availability or high costs of other equipment, supplies, insurance or qualified personnel, in the areas in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur officers and directors have limited liability, and we are required in certain instances to indemnify our officers and directors for breaches of their fiduciary duties.\nWe have adopted provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws which limit the liability of our officers and directors and provide for indemnification by us of our officers and directors to the full extent permitted by Nevada corporate law. Our articles generally provide that our officers and directors shall have no personal liability to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors, except for breaches of their duties of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, acts involving unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or any transaction from which a director derives an improper personal benefit. Such provisions substantially limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to hold officers and directors liable for breaches of fiduciary duty, and may require us to indemnify our officers and directors.\nWe currently have outstanding indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness which could reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest expense and adversely impact our operations and our unit costs.\nWe currently have outstanding indebtedness and in the future, we may incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in order to make acquisitions or to develop our properties. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u25cf a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u25cf a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf any covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u25cf dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u25cf a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing; and\n\u25cf debt covenants to which we may agree may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to arrange financing, we may have to sell significant assets or have a portion of our assets foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur properties are located in Texas and Oklahoma, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nAll of our properties are located in Texas and Oklahoma. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in this area. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and gas producing areas such as the ones we operate in, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, which we may not have available when payments are due.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which we cannot control. In the future, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties, including under our current liabilities. If we do not have sufficient funds on hand to pay our debt, we may be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our lenders, refinance our indebtedness, sell assets or sell additional securities. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. We may not be able obtain such financing or complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, we may not be able to consummate an asset sale to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could result in a default on our debt obligations, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.\nSuccessful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future natural gas and oil prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. These assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. Our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise. There may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. At times, we acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. In addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.\nWe have limited control over activities in properties we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues, affect the timing and amounts of capital requirements and potentially result in a dilution of our respective ownership interest in the event we are unable to make any required capital contributions.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest. As a result, we may have a limited ability to exercise influence over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of underlying properties and their associated costs. For all of the properties that are operated by others, we are dependent on their decision-making with respect to day-to-day operations over which we have little control. The failure of an operator of wells in which we have an interest to adequately perform operations, or an operator\u2019s breach of applicable agreements, could reduce production and revenues we receive from that well. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the timing and amount of capital expenditures, the available expertise and financial resources, the inclusion of other participants and the use of technology. Since we do not own the majority interest in many of the wells we do not operate, we may not be in a position to remove the operator in the event of poor performance.\nRisks Relating To An Investment In Our Securities\nWe are not currently in compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards and if we are unable to maintain compliance with NYSE American continued listing standards, our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE American equities market, which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. The NYSE American will consider suspending dealings in, or delisting, securities of an issuer that does not meet its continued listing standards. If we cannot meet the NYSE American continued listing requirements, the NYSE American may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on us and the liquidity and market price of our stock.\nWe may be unable to comply with NYSE American continued listing standards. Our business has been and may continue to be affected by worldwide macroeconomic factors, which include uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. External factors that affect our stock price, such as liquidity requirements of our investors, as well as our performance, could impact our market capitalization, revenue and operating results, which, in turn, could affect our ability to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing standards. The NYSE American has the ability to suspend trading in our common stock or remove our common stock from listing on the NYSE American if in the opinion of the exchange: (a) the financial condition and/or operating results of the Company appear to be unsatisfactory; or (b) it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of our common stock has become so reduced as to make further dealings on the exchange inadvisable; or (c) we have sold or otherwise disposed of our principal operating assets, or have ceased to be an operating company; or (d) we have failed to comply with our listing agreements with the exchange (which include that we receive additional listing approval from the exchange prior to us issuing any shares of common stock, something we have inadvertently failed to comply with in the past); or (e) any other event shall occur or any condition shall exist which makes further dealings on the exchange unwarranted.\nOn August 3, 2017, we received notice from the NYSE American that the Company is not in compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) through (iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide in that we reported a stockholders\u2019 deficit of $10.6 million as of March 31, 2017 and net losses in our five most recent fiscal years then ended, meaning that we (i) had stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $2,000,000 and sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of our three most recent fiscal years; (ii) had stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $4,000,000 and sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of our four most recent fiscal years; and (iii) had stockholders\u2019 equity of less than $6,000,000 and sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in our five most recent fiscal years. In order to maintain our listing on the Exchange, the Exchange had requested that the Company submit a plan of compliance by September 5, 2017 addressing how the Company intends to regain compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Company Guide by August 3, 2018. The Exchange extended the date to submit a plan to September 20, 2017 and the plan was submitted timely by the extended deadline.\nOn October 5, 2017, we received an additional notification from the Exchange that our securities had been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time and that the Company\u2019s common stock had a 30-day average price below $0.20 as of October 5, 2017. Pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide, the NYSE American staff determined that the Company\u2019s continued listing was predicated on it effecting a reverse stock split of its common stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time, which the staff determined to be until April 5, 2018. Effective on March 5, 2018, we affected a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock which satisfied the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing requirements as to the trading price of our common stock.\nOn November 3, 2017, the Company was notified that the Exchange accepted the Company\u2019s plan to regain compliance with the Exchange\u2019s continued listing standards set forth in Sections 1003(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Company Guide by August 3, 2018, subject to periodic review by the Exchange for compliance with the initiatives set forth in the plan. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by August 3, 2018, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the plan during the plan period, the NYSE Regulation staff may initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate.\nAdditionally, on November 7, 2017, the Company was notified by the Exchange that it was back in compliance with the separate continued listing deficiency relating to non-compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the Company Guide, which previously announced deficiency was due to the fact that the Company did not timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which report was filed on November 6, 2017.\nIf we are unable to retain compliance with the NYSE American criteria for continued listing, our common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock and reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing. In addition, delisting from the NYSE American might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business. Additionally, if we were delisted from the NYSE American and we are not able to list our common stock on another national exchange we will no longer be eligible to use Form S-3 registration statements (which we are currently unable to use due to the late filing described above and our ongoing defaults with IBC Bank) and will instead be required to file a Form S-1 registration statement for any primary or secondary offerings of our common stock, which would delay our ability to raise funds in the future, may limit the type of offerings of common stock we could undertake, and would increase the expenses of any offering, as, among other things, registration statements on Form S-1 are subject to SEC review and comments whereas take downs pursuant to a previously filed Form S-3 are not.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE American, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock would also be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American, it would come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and would be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends to our stockholders.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe currently have an illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock is and may remain illiquid and volatile in the future.\nWe currently have a highly sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in the future. Factors that could affect our stock price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u25cf our actual or anticipated operating and financial performance and drilling locations, including reserve estimates;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income/loss per share, net income/loss and cash flows, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in revenue, cash flows or earnings estimates or publication of reports by equity research analysts;\n\u25cf speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf public reaction to our press releases, announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us or other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf the amount of our freely tradable common stock available in the public marketplace;\n\u25cf general financial market conditions and oil and natural gas industry market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u25cf the realization of any of the risk factors that we are subject to;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u25cf the prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil and natural gas we produce;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u25cf domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American under the symbol \u201cCEI.\u201d Our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Due to the limited volume of our shares which trade, we believe that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) may not be related to our actual value, and not reflect the actual value of our common stock. You should exercise caution before making an investment in us.\nAdditionally, as a result of the illiquidity of our common stock, investors may not be interested in owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a stockholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common stock as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited market. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if one develops, may not be sustained.\nA prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock could affect our ability to obtain additional financing which would adversely affect our operations.\nHistorically, we have relied on equity and debt financing as primary sources of financing. A prolonged decline in the market price of our common stock or a reduction in our accessibility to the global markets may result in our inability to secure additional financing which would have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe warrants sold in our April 2014 offering have anti-dilution rights which could cause their exercise price to be reduced.\nThe warrants sold in our April 2014 offering include anti-dilution rights, which provide that if at any time the warrants are outstanding (i.e., through April 2019), we issue or are deemed to have issued (which includes shares issuable upon exercise of warrants and options and conversion of convertible securities) for consideration less than the then current exercise price of the warrants, the exercise price of such warrants is automatically reduced (a) to the lowest price per share of consideration provided or deemed to have been provided for such securities, not to be deemed less than $0.01 per share, during the one year period following the closing date of the offering (April 21, 2014), which date passed without any required adjustments; and thereafter (b) to the product of (x) the exercise price then in effect, and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of shares of common stock which the aggregate consideration received by us would purchase at the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance plus the number of such additional shares of common stock issued. Notwithstanding the above, no adjustment of the exercise price is required in connection with any issuances or deemed issuance of shares of common stock (1) to our officers, directors, consultants or employees pursuant to stock option or stock purchase plans or agreements on terms approved by our Board of Directors, subject to adjustment for all subdivisions and combinations; and (2) in connection with the re-negotiation, modification, extension or re-pricing of debt of the Company outstanding on the closing date, subject to the prior written approval of the holders of the warrants. Additionally, in the event we acquire ownership of another entity or a significant amount of assets from another person or entity by way of an asset purchase agreement, merger (pursuant to which we are the surviving entity and our common stock is not converted or exchanged), business combination or share exchange pursuant to which shares of our common stock or convertible securities (including options or warrants) are issued or granted by us as partial or sole consideration to the counterparty or counterparties in such transaction or series of transactions (a \u201cCompany Combination\u201d), then and in such event, the exercise price of the warrants is automatically reduced, to the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices of our common stock averaged over the thirty (30) business days after the closing of the Company Combination if such exercise price as adjusted is less than the exercise price in effect on the date such Company Combination Price is determined.\nNevada law and our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue shares of stock which shares may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nWe have authorized capital stock consisting of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. As of June 28, 2018, we had 15,574,255 shares of common stock outstanding, 408,508 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding and 1,112 shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding (each as described in greater detail below under \u201cItem 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d - \u201cDescription of Capital Stock\u201d - \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d). As a result, our Board of Directors has the ability to issue a large number of additional shares of common stock without stockholder approval, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), which if issued could cause substantial dilution to our then stockholders. Shares of additional preferred stock may also be issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval, with voting powers and such preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and powers as determined by our Board of Directors, which may be greater than the shares of common stock currently outstanding. As a result, shares of preferred stock may be issued by our Board of Directors which cause the holders to have majority voting power over our shares, provide the holders of the preferred stock the right to convert the shares of preferred stock they hold into shares of our common stock, which may cause substantial dilution to our then common stock stockholders and/or have other rights and preferences greater than those of our common stock stockholders. Investors should keep in mind that the Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, which could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. Additionally, the dilutive effect of any preferred stock which we may issue may be exacerbated given the fact that such preferred stock may have super voting rights and/or other rights or preferences which could provide the preferred stockholders with substantial voting control over us subsequent to the date of this prospectus and/or give those holders the power to prevent or cause a change in control. As a result, the issuance of shares of common stock and/or Preferred Stock may cause the value of our securities to decrease and/or become worthless.\nStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and/or satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nWherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of shares of our common stock. Subject to certain consent rights of the investor in our April 2016/October 2017 financings, our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock (subject to NYSE American rules which limit among other things, the number of shares we can issue without stockholder approval to no more than 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock). These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders, and that dilution may be material.\nIf persons engage in short sales of our common stock, including sales of shares to be issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, convertible debentures and preferred stock, the price of our common stock may decline.\nSelling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security. In addition, holders of options, warrants and other convertible securities will sometimes sell short knowing they can, in effect, cover through the exercise or conversion of options, warrants and other convertible securities, thus locking in a profit. A significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security. Further sales of common stock issued upon exercise or conversion of options, warrants and other convertible securities could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market upon such exercise/conversion, which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock. You could, therefore, experience a decline in the value of your investment as a result of short sales of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at a favorable price or at all.\nMany factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall, including: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations; changes in market valuations of companies in our industry; changes in expectations of future financial performance; fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes; issuances of dilutive common stock or other securities in the future; the addition or departure of key personnel; announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and the increase or decline in the price of oil and natural gas.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether future issuances of our common stock or resales in the open market will decrease the market price of our common stock. The impact of any such issuances or resales of our common stock on our market price may be increased as a result of the fact that our common stock is thinly, or infrequently, traded. The exercise of any options that we have or that we may grant to directors, executive officers and other employees in the future, the issuance of common stock in connection with acquisitions and other issuances of our common stock (including shares previously registered in our registration statements and prospectus supplements, and/or in connection with future registration statements or prospectus supplements) could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, future issuances of our common stock may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Any sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could lower the market price of our common stock.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a fully reporting publicly traded company and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our status as a fully reporting public company. Specifically, we are required to prepare and file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Additionally, our officers, directors and significant stockholders are required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 and Schedules 13D/G with the SEC disclosing their ownership of the Company and changes in such ownership. Furthermore, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure of controls and procedures. The costs and expenses of compliance with SEC rules and our filing obligations with the SEC, or our identification of deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause the market price of our stock to decline in value.\nSecurities analyst coverage or lack of coverage may have a negative impact on our common stock\u2019s market price.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities or industry analysts stop their coverage of us or additional securities and industry analysts fail to cover us in the future, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If any analyst or analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock, changes their opinion of our shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst or analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease and we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nDue to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements which increase our cost and expenses.\nWe are currently required to file annual and quarterly information and other reports with the SEC that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Additionally, due to the fact that our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we are also subject to the requirements to maintain independent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements and are required to pay annual listing and stock issuance fees. These obligations require a commitment of additional resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our senior management\u2019s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. These obligations increase our expenses and may make it more complicated or time consuming for us to undertake certain corporate actions due to the fact that we may require the approval of the NYSE American for such transactions and/or NYSE American rules may require us to obtain stockholder approval for such transactions.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or other equity issuances.\nWe may in the future issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock.\nRisks Relating to the LOI\nOn June 25, 2018, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with an entity affiliated with Mr. Azar and Donnie B. Seay, our current director (the \u201cLOI\u201d). The LOI contemplates the Company and the entity entering into, among other agreements, an asset purchase agreement whereby the Company will transfer substantially all of its assets to the entity, reserving its assets in Glasscock County and Hutchinson Counties, Texas and will also retain a 12.5% production payment and a 3% overriding royalty interest in its existing Okfuskee County, Oklahoma asset, in consideration for the entity assuming all of the Company\u2019s senior bank debt owed to IBC. The LOI is subject to various conditions, as are the transactions contemplated therein, including, but not limited to, approval of IBC and approval of the Company\u2019s shareholders for the contemplated transactions.\nFailure to complete the transactions contemplated by the LOI could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\nIf the transactions contemplated by the LOI (the \u201cLOI Transactions\u201d) are not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf we will not realize the benefits expected from the LOI Transactions, including a significant reduction in outstanding debt and will remain in default of the IBC Bank loan agreement;\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our partners and employees;\n\u25cf IBC Bank may foreclose on our assets securing the IBC debt; and\n\u25cf matters relating to the LOI Transactions may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the LOI Transactions are pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the LOI Transactions on employees and partners may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the LOI Transactions are completed or terminated, and could cause partners and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships, cease doing business with us or cause potential new partners to delay doing business with us until the LOI Transactions have been successfully completed. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the LOI Transactions, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles or compensation structure. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, our business following the LOI Transactions could be negatively impacted. In addition, the LOI Transactions restrict us from taking other specified actions until the LOI Transactions are completed. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the LOI Transactions.\nCompletion of the LOI Transactions are subject to a number of conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the LOI Transactions will not be completed.\nThe LOI Transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including (1) approval by our stockholders in connection with the LOI Transactions and (2) approval of the transactions by IBC Bank. Failure to fulfill any of such closing conditions could prevent us from completing the LOI Transactions and have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nTermination of the LOI or LOI Transactions could negatively impact us.\nIn the event the LOI or LOI Transactions are terminated, our business may be adversely impacted by our failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the LOI Transactions, and the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the LOI Transactions will be completed.\nIf the benefits of the LOI Transactions do not meet the expectations of the marketplace, or financial or industry analysts, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the LOI Transactions if we do not otherwise achieve the perceived benefits of the LOI Transactions as rapidly as, or to the extent, anticipated by the marketplace, or financial or industry analysts. Accordingly, investors may experience a loss as a result of a decreasing stock price and we may not be able to raise future capital, if necessary, in the equity markets.\nIn the event the LOI Transactions close, we may purse acquisition and/or merger opportunities and/or affect a change in business focus.\nIn the event the LOI Transactions close, we may purse acquisition and/or merger opportunities to enhance our value and growth prospects, which may result in a change in business focus. As a result our majority shareholders may change and new shares of common or preferred stock may be issued, resulting in substantial dilution to our then current shareholders. As a result, if there were new majority shareholders, they may change the composition of our Board of Directors and replace our current management. The new management may change, and/or acquisition or merger opportunities may result in the change of, our business focus and we can make no assurances that our future management will be able to properly manage the Company or that any change in our business focus will be successful. If we do not affect an acquisition and/or enter into merger or business combinations subsequent to affecting the LOI Transactions, we may be forced to scale back or abandon our operations, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline or become worthless.\nRisks Related To Our Outstanding Convertible Securities\nDue to the occurrence of a trigger event under, and other adjustment mechanisms related to, the First Warrant, the premium associated therewith increased to 17% per annum and upon the exercise thereof, the premium through maturity was due in full.\nA trigger event under the First Warrant occurred on June 30, 2016. As a result thereof, and as a result of certain other adjustment mechanisms in the First Warrant, the premium on the First Warrant increased from 6% per annum to 17% per annum. Pursuant to the terms of the First Warrant, the premium through maturity (i.e., seven years) was due upon exercise of the First Warrant. The premium is payable by way of the conversion of the total premium payable in connection therewith $5,355,000 into shares of our common stock at a discount to the volume weighted average sales price of our common stock during a specified measurement period. As such, as long as the value of our common stock continues to decline in value, the Investor may be due more shares of common stock, which issuances will significantly dilute existing shareholders and the sale of which securities will likely result in the continuous decline in the value of our common stock, thereby resulting in even more shares being due to the Investor. As of June 28, 2018, a total of 4.9 million shares of common stock had been issued to the Investor in connection with the exercise of the First Warrant.\nThe full amount of premiums, interest and dividends through the maturity date of each applicable security is due upon the repayment/redemption (where applicable), exercise or conversion, as applicable, of the Debenture and Series C Preferred Stock.\nThe Debenture and Series C Preferred Stock provide that all applicable interest (due under the terms of the Debenture), and dividends (due under the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock), which each initially accrued in the amount of 6% per annum and which increase or decrease subject to the terms of the applicable securities, based on among other things, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, up to a maximum of 34.95% per annum (which pursuant to the Investor, are the current applicable percentage interest rates for the Debenture and the shares of Series C Preferred Stock sold in April 2016, with the applicable percentage rate of the Series C Preferred Stock sold in October 2017, having an applicable percentage rate of 24.95%), are due upon exercise or conversion, or repayment/redemption (where applicable) thereof, for the full seven year term of such securities.\nThe requirement that we pay all premiums, interest and dividends through maturity and the adjustable nature of such premium, interest and dividend rates, may force us to issue the Investor significant additional shares of common stock (similar to the currently disclosed required issuance to the Investor under the First Warrant), which may cause significant dilution to existing stockholders. The requirement that we pay all premiums, interest and dividends through maturity may make it too costly for us to repay or redeem, as applicable, the Investor\u2019s securities, prior to exercise/conversion thereof, as applicable.\nThe number of shares of common stock issuable in consideration for premiums, interest and dividends through maturity on the First Warrant, Debenture and Series C Preferred Stock, continue to be adjustable after the exercise or conversion of such securities.\nPursuant to the terms of the First Warrant, Debenture and Series C Preferred Stock, the conversion rate of such securities in connection with the premiums, interest and dividends due on such securities through maturity (each 7 years, regardless of when converted or exercised), continues to be adjustable after the issuance of such securities. Specifically, such securities remain adjustable, based on a discount to the lowest daily volume weighted average price during a measuring period for a period of 60 days after the applicable number of shares stated in the initial exercise/conversion notice have actually been received into the Investor\u2019s designated brokerage account in electronic form and fully cleared for trading (subject to certain extensions described in the applicable securities). Because the Investor is limited to holding not more than 4.99% of the Company\u2019s common stock upon exercise/conversion of any security, the Investor will not receive all of the shares due upon any exercise/conversion, until it has sold shares and been issued additional shares and as such, the beginning date for the applicable 30 or 60 day period after issuance/conversion is impossible to determine and may be a significant additional number of days after the initial exercise/conversion by the Investor.\nIn the event of a decrease in the Company\u2019s stock price during the applicable measuring periods, the conversion rate of the premiums, interest and dividends due on such applicable securities will adjust downward and the Investor will be due additional shares of common stock, which issuances may cause further significant dilution to existing shareholders and the sale of such shares may cause the value of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline in value. Furthermore, it is likely that the sale by the Investor of the shares of common stock which the Investor receives in connection with any exercise/conversion, including, but not limited to the shares of common stock which the Investor received in connection with the exercise of the First Warrant, during the applicable measuring period, will cause the value of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline in value and the conversion rate to decrease and will result in the Investor being due additional shares of common stock during the measuring period, which will trigger additional decreases in the value of the Company\u2019s common stock upon further public sales by the Investor. If this were to occur, the Investor would be entitled to receive an increasing number of shares, upon exercise/conversion of the remaining securities, which could then be sold, triggering further price declines and exercises/conversions for even larger numbers of shares, which would cause additional dilution to our existing stockholders and would likely cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Debenture and Series C Preferred Stock will cause immediate and substantial dilution and the sale of such stock will cause significant downward pressure on our stock price.\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Debenture and Series C Preferred Stock will result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders. Although the Investor may not receive shares of common stock exceeding 4.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately after affecting such exercise/conversion, this restriction does not prevent the Investor from receiving shares up to the 4.99% limit, selling those shares, and then receiving the rest of the shares it is due, in one of more tranches, while still staying below the 4.99% limit. If the Investor chooses to do this, it will cause substantial dilution to the then holders of our common stock. Additionally, the continued sale of shares issuable upon successive conversions/exercises will likely create significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock as the Investor sells material amounts of our common stock over time and/or in a short period of time. This could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock and in turn result in the Investor receiving an ever increasing number of additional shares of common stock upon exercise/conversion of its securities, and adjustments thereof, which in turn will likely lead to further dilution, reductions in the exercise/conversion price of the Investor\u2019s securities and even more downward pressure on our common stock, which could lead to our common stock becoming devalued or worthless.\nThe Investor, subject to applicable contractual restrictions, and/or a third party, may sell short our common stock, which could have a depressive effect on the price of our common stock.\nAs described above, the conversion price for the value of premiums, interest and dividends due in connection with the First Warrant, Debenture and Series C Preferred Stock, is based on a discount to the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Investor is not currently prohibited from selling the Company\u2019s stock short. Additionally, nothing prohibits a third party from selling the Company\u2019s common stock short based on their belief that due to the dilution caused by the conversions/exercises of the securities held by the Investor, that the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock will decline in value. The significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock as the Investor sells material amounts of our common stock could encourage investors to short sell our common stock. This could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock and in turn result in the Investor receiving additional shares of common stock upon exercise/conversion of its securities, and adjustments thereof.\nThe Company is limited in its ability to undertake subsequent financings.\nUntil the later of (a) six months after the entire Debenture has been converted or redeemed; and (b) the date that the Investor no longer holds any shares of Series C Preferred Stock, we agreed that we would not issue or enter into or amend an agreement pursuant to which we may issue any shares of common stock, other than (a) for restricted securities with no registration rights, (b) in connection with a strategic acquisition, (c) in an underwritten public offering, or (d) at a fixed price; or issue or amend any debt or equity securities convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or including the right to receive, shares of common stock (i) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other price that is based upon or varies with, the trading prices of or quotations for the shares of common stock at any time after the initial issuance of the security or (ii) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of the security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the common stock. These restrictions may make it more costly for us to raise funding in the future or may limit our ability to raise funding, which could force us to curtail our business plan or prohibit us from taking advantage of attractive investment, acquisition or drilling activities. All of which could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock and our near-term or long-term prospects.", "PERMNO": 92571, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CEI"}
