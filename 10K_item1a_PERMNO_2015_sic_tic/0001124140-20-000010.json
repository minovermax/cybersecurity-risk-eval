{"cik": "1124140", "company": "EXACT SCIENCES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks. If we are unable to address these risks, our business may not grow, our stock price may suffer, and we may be unable to stay in business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and Business Strategy\nWe may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred losses since we were formed. From our date of inception on February 10, 1995 through December 31, 2019, we have accumulated a total deficit of approximately $1.1 billion. We expect to continue investing significantly toward development and commercialization of our colorectal cancer screening technology, our Oncotype DX tests and other products and services. If our revenue does not grow significantly, we will not be profitable. We cannot be certain that the revenue from the sale of any products or services based on our technologies will be sufficient to make us profitable.\nWe may need additional capital to execute our business plan.\nAlthough we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, we may require additional capital to fully fund our current strategic plan, which includes successfully commercializing our Cologuard and Oncotype DX tests and developing a pipeline of future products and services. Additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Our success in raising additional capital may be significantly affected by general market conditions, the market price of our common stock, our financial condition, uncertainty about the future commercial success of our current products and services, the development and commercial success of future products or services, regulatory developments, the status and scope of our intellectual property, any ongoing litigation, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and other factors. If we raise additional funds through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could be depressed. We may issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, licensing arrangements or other structured financing transactions, we may relinquish rights to our technologies or products or services, grant security interests in our assets or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable to us.\nOur success depends heavily on our Cologuard colorectal cancer screening test and our Oncotype DX breast cancer test.\nFor at least the next 12 months, our ability to generate revenues will depend very substantially on the commercial success of our Cologuard and Oncotype DX breast cancer tests. There can be no assurance that we will develop or commercialize any other products or services that will generate significant revenue. The commercial success of our tests and our ability to generate revenues will depend on a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022acceptance in the medical community;\n\u2022inclusion in healthcare guidelines and recommendations, such as those developed by ACS, USPSTF, ASCO, and NCCN and similar guidelines and recommendations outside the United States;\n\u2022inclusion in quality measures including the HEDIS measures and the CMS Medicare Advantage Star Ratings;\n\u2022recommendations and studies that may be published by government agencies, companies, professional organizations, academic or medical journals or other key opinion leaders;\n\u2022patient acceptance and demand;\n\u2022patient compliance with orders for our tests by healthcare providers, and patient adherence to recommendations regarding periodic re-testing;\n\u2022successful sales, marketing, and educational programs, including successful direct-to-patient marketing such as television advertising and social media;\n\u2022the number of patients screened for colorectal cancer, as well as the number of patients who use Cologuard for that purpose;\n\u2022number of women diagnosed with breast cancer;\n\u2022sufficient coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers within and outside the U.S.\n\u2022the existence of federal or state laws that mandate coverage for colorectal cancer screening, the extent to which those laws mandate coverage of Cologuard and the enforcement of those laws;\n\u2022the amount and nature of competition from other products and procedures;\n\u2022maintaining regulatory approvals to legally market;\n\u2022the ease of use of our ordering process for healthcare providers;\n\u2022maintaining and defending patent protection for the intellectual property relevant to our products and services; and\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain adequate commercial manufacturing, distribution, sales and CLIA laboratory testing capabilities.\nIf we are unable to continue to grow sales of our Cologuard and Oncotype DX breast cancer tests or if we are delayed or limited in doing so, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and cause losses to our stockholders.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly, depending on a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022our success in marketing and selling, and changes in demand for, our Cologuard and Oncotype DX tests, and the level of reimbursement and collection obtained for such tests;\n\u2022seasonal variations affecting healthcare provider recommendations for our tests and patient compliance with healthcare provider recommendations, including without limitation holidays, weather events, and circumstances such as the outbreak of influenza that may limit patient access to medical practices for diagnostic tests and preventive services;\n\u2022our success in collecting payments from third-party payers, patients and collaborative partners, variation in the timing of these payments and recognition of these payments as revenues;\n\u2022the pricing of our tests, including potential changes in CMS or other reimbursement rates;\n\u2022circumstances affecting our ability to provide our tests, including weather events, supply shortages, or regulatory or other circumstances that adversely affect our ability to manufacture our tests or process tests in our clinical laboratories;\n\u2022fluctuations in the amount and timing of our selling and marketing costs and our ability to manage costs and expenses and effectively implement our business; and\n\u2022our research and development activities, including the timing of costly clinical trials.\nOther companies or institutions may develop and market novel or improved technologies, which may make our technologies less competitive or obsolete.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. There are a number of private and public companies that offer products or have announced that they are developing products that compete, or may one day compete, with ours. Some of our current and potential competitors possess greater brand recognition, financial and other resources and development capabilities than us. As more information regarding cancer genomics becomes available to the public, we anticipate that competition will further increase. We expect to compete with a broad range of organizations in the U.S. and other countries that are engaged in the development, production and commercialization of cancer screening and diagnostic products and services. These competitors include:\n\u2022biotechnology, diagnostic and other life science companies;\n\u2022academic and scientific institutions;\n\u2022governmental agencies; and\n\u2022public and private research organizations.\nThe U.S. market for colorectal cancer and pre-cancer screening is large, consisting of nearly 106 million individuals between the ages of 45 and 85, and has attracted numerous competitors. Our Cologuard test faces competition from procedure-based detection technologies such as colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and \u201cvirtual\u201d colonoscopy, a radiological imaging approach that visualizes the inside of the bowel by CT scan (spiral computerized axial tomography), as well as other common screening tests, such as the fecal occult blood test and the fecal immunochemical test, and newer screening technologies. Newer screening technologies include liquid biopsy tests, such as Epi proColon, approved by the FDA in April 2016, and pill-based imaging solutions like PillCam COLON, cleared by the FDA in February 2014.\nIn addition, some companies and institutions are developing liquid biopsy tests based on the detection of proteins, tumor cells, nucleic acids, epigenetic markers, or other biomarkers in the blood. These tests could represent significant competition for Cologuard or other tests we may develop, including our HCC test. We are aware of a number of companies-including Bioprognos, Cambridge Epigenetix Limited, CellMax, Inc., DiaCarta, EDP Biotech Corporation, Epigenomics AG, Freenome Inc., Genomictree, Glycotest, GRAIL, Inc., Guardant Health, Inc., Immunovia AB, Laboratory for Advanced Medicine, Natera Inc., Nucleix Ltd., Thrive, Inc., Singlera Genomics, and Volition Diagnostics - that have developed, or are developing, liquid biopsy tests for the detection of cancer. Guardant Health, Inc. has begun enrolling patients in a prospective clinical trial intended to support FDA approval, and other companies, including Freenome Inc., are likely to do so in the future.\nWe also are aware of at least three companies, DiaTech Pharmacogenetics, Prescient Metabiomics, and Geneoscopy, that are seeking to develop, stool-based colorectal cancer tests in the U.S. Our competitors may also be developing additional methods of detecting colorectal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced.\nSimilarly our Oncotype DX products compete against a number of companies that offer products or have conducted research to profile genes and gene expression in breast, colon and prostate cancer. These companies include Agendia Inc., BioTheranostics, GenomeDx Biosciences Inc., Guardant Health, Inc., Hologic Inc., Myriad Genetics Inc. (and its Sividon Diagnostics subsidiary), Pacific Edge Limited, NanoString Technologies Inc., NeoGenomics, Inc., OPKO Health, Inc. (and its Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc. subsidiary), Qiagen N.V. and Veracyte, Inc. Historically, our principal competition for our Oncotype DX tests has also come from existing diagnostic methods used by pathologists and oncologists, and such traditional diagnostic methods can be difficult to change or supplement. Our Oncotype DX tests also face competition from commercial laboratories with strong distribution networks for diagnostic tests, such as Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings and Quest Diagnostics Incorporated. Other potential competitors include companies that develop diagnostic tests such as Roche Diagnostics, a division of Roche Holding, Ltd, and Siemens AG, as well as other companies and academic and research institutions.\nFor our prostate cancer tests, we face comparatively greater competition than for our breast cancer tests, including competition from products which were on the market prior to our product launch and which are supported by clinical studies and published data. This existing direct and indirect competition for tests and procedures may make it difficult to gain market share, impact our ability to obtain reimbursement or result in a substantial increase in resources necessary for us to successfully continue to commercialize our Oncotype DX GPS prostate test and the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test.\nWe have changed the list price of our Oncotype DX tests in the past, and we expect to change prices for our tests in the future. Any increase or decrease in pricing could impact reimbursement of and demand for our tests. Others may develop lower priced tests that could be viewed by healthcare providers and payers as functionally equivalent to our tests, or offer tests at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the list prices of our tests and impact our operating margins and our ability to achieve sustained profitability. Additionally, our Oncotype DX tests are currently marketed as LDTs, and we may bring future products to market as LDT. Some competitors have developed tests cleared or approved for marketing by the FDA. There may be a marketing differentiation or perception in some markets that an FDA cleared or approved test is more desirable than an LDT, and that may discourage adoption of and reimbursement for our Oncotype DX tests.\nWe are aware of at least 5 companies that are developing or have developed liquid biopsy-based liver cancer screening or diagnostic tests - Laboratory for Advanced Medicine, JBS Science, EarlyDx, Glycotest and Epigenomics. Epigenomics recently received a CE mark for their HCCBloodTest.\nCompetitors may develop their own versions of our tests in countries where we did not apply for patents, where our patents have not issued or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized and compete with us in those countries, including encouraging the use of their test by healthcare providers or patients in other countries.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources, or stronger business relationships. These competitors may have broader product lines and greater name recognition than we do. Furthermore, even if we do develop new marketable products or services, our current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more commercially attractive than ours, and they may bring those products and services to market earlier or more effectively than us. If we are unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance for and sales of our tests, which could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or achieving sustained profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf any of our facilities or our laboratory equipment were damaged or destroyed, or if we experience a significant disruption in our operations for any reason, our ability to continue to operate our business could be materially harmed.\nWe currently perform our Cologuard test in two laboratory facilities in Madison, Wisconsin. We manufacture the Cologuard test in a single facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Our headquarters are also located in Madison, Wisconsin.\nAs we expand the commercialization of products and services and increase the number of tests processed by our laboratory facilities, we believe it may be necessary to both expand our existing laboratory facilities and to add one or more new manufacturing and laboratory facilities in order to increase our manufacturing and processing capacity to meet anticipated demand. During 2018 we expanded the capacity at our first laboratory facility in Madison, Wisconsin to approximately three million Cologuard tests per year. In 2019, we began performing the Cologuard test out of a second laboratory facility in Madison, Wisconsin. We estimate our current annual capacity to perform the Cologuard test at approximately seven million tests per year. We are also in the process of building an additional manufacturing facility and additional warehouse and office space, which are expected to be completed in early 2020. Manufacturing in the new facility is expected to commence during 2020. We are also constructing a new headquarters facility in Madison, Wisconsin, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020. Failure to complete, or timely complete, these expansion projects, may significantly delay our Cologuard processing times and capabilities, or other operations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, our financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to complete these expansion projects on budget and otherwise on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Finally, our financial condition will be adversely affected if demand for our products and services does not materialize in line with our current expectations and if, as a result, we end up building excess capacity that does not yield a reasonable return on our investment.\nWe perform our Oncotype DX tests out of our clinical laboratory facilities in Redwood City, California. Redwood City is situated near active earthquake fault lines and we do not have a redundant facility where we can perform our Oncotype DX tests. If our present, or any future facilities, were to be damaged, destroyed or otherwise unable to operate, whether due to fire, floods, storms, tornadoes, earthquakes, other inclement weather events or natural disasters, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages, or otherwise, it may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our tests for some period of time and our business could be severely disrupted. Our facilities and the equipment we use to perform our tests would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The inability to perform our tests or the backlog of tests that could develop if any of our facilities become inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers in the future. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn order to rely on a third party to perform certain of our tests, we could only use another facility with established state licensure and CLIA accreditation under the scope of which Oncotype DX tests could be performed following validation and other required procedures. We cannot assure you that we would be able to find another CLIA certified facility willing to comply with the required procedures, that this laboratory would be willing to perform the tests for us on commercially reasonable terms, or that it would be able to meet our quality or regulatory standards. In order to establish a redundant clinical reference laboratory outside of our Redwood City, California facilities, we would have to spend considerable time and money securing adequate space, constructing the facility, recruiting and training employees, and establishing the additional operational and administrative infrastructure necessary to support a second facility. We may not be able, or it may take considerable time, to replicate our testing processes or results in a new facility. Additionally, any new clinical reference laboratory facility opened by us would be subject to certification under CLIA and licensing by several states, including California and New York, which could take a significant amount of time and result in delays in our ability to resume operations.\nWe rely upon certain single-source suppliers and loss or interruption of supply from single-source suppliers could have a disruptive effect on our business.\nWe purchase certain supplies from third-party suppliers and manufacturers. In some cases, due to the unique attributes of products that are incorporated into our tests, we maintain a single-source supplier relationship. These third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational, regulatory compliance, and financial risks that are outside our control. These third parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner and they may be unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our tests or future products or services. Moreover, we may become dependent on other single-source suppliers as we expand and develop our product and service pipeline. The loss of a single-source supplier, the failure to perform by a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single-source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied materials by a single-source supplier could have a disruptive effect on our business, and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure in our information technology, storage systems or our clinical laboratory equipment could significantly disrupt our operations and our research and development efforts.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems, which support our operations, including at our clinical laboratories, and our research and development efforts. We are dependent on our IT systems to receive and process test orders, securely store patient health records and deliver the results of our tests. The integrity and protection of our own data, and that of our customers and employees, is critical to our business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts, breaches due to employee error and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, unauthorized access, loss or disclosure could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to:\n\u2022process tests, provide test results, bill payers or patients;\n\u2022process claims and appeals;\n\u2022provide customer assistance services;\n\u2022conduct research and development activities;\n\u2022collect, process and prepare company financial information;\n\u2022provide information about our tests and other patient and healthcare provider education and outreach efforts through our website; and\n\u2022and manage the administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation.\nAny such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, similar U.S. state data protection regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and other regulations, the breach of which could result in significant penalties.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health related and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. Genomic Health self-certified with the Department of Commerce for compliance with the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield in August 2016, and Exact Sciences self-certified in November 2019. We believe these self-certifications will mitigate customer concerns about overseas data transfers. However there continue to be concerns about whether the Privacy Shield will face additional challenges (similar to those that invalidated the prior Safe Harbor data transfer framework), and it is not guaranteed that companies who have self-certified under the Privacy Shield will be free of additional ongoing scrutiny by E.U. data protection authorities. Compliance with Privacy Shield requirements does not, in addition, equate to compliance with the stringent requirements of the GDPR. European data protection authorities could interpret or apply European data protection law in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in prohibitions on processing of data required to perform our tests in Europe or government-imposed fines, or both, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws could in addition cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nSystem upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources. We recently deployed SAP SE and Epic Systems Corporation (\u201cEpic\u201d) software in our Madison, Wisconsin based operations and expect additional significant software upgrades and roll-outs in the next 12 months and beyond. We expect that Epic\u2019s software will handle multiple components of our information technology system, from order entry all the way through revenue cycle and customer care. We continue to evaluate options to integrate Genomic Health's information technology systems and the schedule for conducting any such integration activities. Differences in software and systems across our operations may create complexity and compatibility problems. Delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our expanding operations, integrating new systems, protecting confidential patient information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems issues and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on courier delivery services to transport Cologuard collection kits to patients and samples for all of our tests back to laboratory facilities for analysis. If these delivery services are disrupted or become prohibitively expensive, customer satisfaction and our business could be negatively impacted.\nIn most cases, we ship Cologuard collection kits to patients, and patients ship samples to our Madison, Wisconsin laboratory facilities for analysis, by air and ground express courier delivery service. Additionally, medical providers typically ship samples for Oncotype DX testing to our laboratory facilities in Redwood City, California via air and ground express courier delivery service. Disruptions in delivery service, whether due to bad weather, natural disaster, labor disruptions, terrorist acts or threats, or for other reasons, can adversely affect customer satisfaction, specimen quality and our ability to provide our services on a timely basis. If the courier delivery services that transport Cologuard collection kits or other test samples institute significant price increases, our profitability would be negatively affected and we may need to identify alternative delivery methods, if possible, modify our service model, or attempt to raise our pricing, which may not be possible with regard to Medicare claims or commercially practicable with regard to commercial claims.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities currently require the use of hazardous materials and medical specimens. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials or specimens. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant and could negatively affect our operating results.\nThe success of our business is substantially dependent upon the efforts of our senior management team and our ability to attract and retain personnel.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team. Our executives are critical to directing and managing our growth and development in the future. Our success is substantially dependent upon our senior management\u2019s ability to lead our company, implement successful corporate strategies and initiatives, develop key relationships, including relationships with collaborators and business partners, and successfully commercialize products and services. If we were to lose any of our senior management team, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies.\nCompetition for desirable personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary staff. Our research and development programs, commercial laboratory operations and information technology infrastructure depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified talent due to the competition for qualified personnel among life science and technology businesses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel. In addition, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain salespeople with extensive experience in primary care, oncology, gastroenterology and urology and close relationships with healthcare providers and other hospital personnel. All of our employees in the U.S. are at will, which means that either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nOur business and reputation will suffer if we are unable to establish and comply with, stringent quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our tests.\nInherent risks are involved in providing and marketing cancer tests and related services. Patients and healthcare providers rely on us to provide accurate clinical and diagnostic information that may be used to make critical healthcare decisions. As such, users of our tests may have a greater sensitivity to errors than users of some other types of products and services.\nWe must maintain top service standards and FDA-mandated and other quality controls. Past or future performance or accuracy defects, incomplete or improper process controls, excessively slow turnaround times, unanticipated uses of our tests or mishandling of samples or test results (whether by us, patients, healthcare providers, courier delivery services or others) can lead to adverse outcomes for patients and interruptions to our services. These events could lead to voluntary or legally mandated safety alerts relating to our tests or our laboratory facilities and could result in the removal of our products and\nservices from the market or the suspension of our laboratories' operations. Insufficient quality controls and any resulting negative outcomes could result in significant costs and litigation, as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our tests and payers\u2019 willingness to cover our tests. Even if we maintain adequate controls and procedures, damaging and costly errors may occur.\nProduct and professional liability suits against us could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages and increases in our insurance rates.\nThe sale and use of our tests could lead to product or professional liability claims. We may also be subject to liability for errors in the test results we provide to healthcare providers or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. Claims could also arise out of clinical studies we may conduct or any of our other activities. A product or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages, be costly and time consuming to defend, and cause material harm to our business, reputation or financial condition. We cannot assure you that our liability insurance would protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product or professional liability claim. Any claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.\nOur inability to manage growth could harm our business.\nIn connection with the commercialization of our tests, we have added, and expect to continue to add personnel in the areas of sales and marketing, laboratory operations, billing and collections, quality assurance and compliance. Our number of full-time employees has increased from 1,268, as of December 31, 2017, to 1,977, as of December 31, 2018 and to 4,110, as of December 31, 2019. In particular, we added 896 employees in 2019 in connection with our combination with Genomic Health. Further, as we build our commercialization efforts and expand research and development activities for new products and services, the scope and complexity of our operations is increasing significantly. As a result of our growth, our operating expenses and capital requirements have also increased, and we expect that they will continue to increase significantly. Our ability to manage our growth effectively requires us to expend funds to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. As we move forward in commercializing our tests, we will also need to effectively manage our growing manufacturing, laboratory operations and sales and marketing needs. We are continuing to expand our current facilities and add new facilities to support anticipated demand for our tests and anticipated growth in our personnel. We face various risks in managing these expansion efforts, including financing, construction delays, budget management, quality control, design efficiency, and transition execution. If we are unable to manage our anticipated growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nWe may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and reduce our financial resources.\nWe have recently undertaken certain acquisition activities. In October 2018, we acquired the stock of Biomatrica, Inc., and in November 2019, we completed our combination with Genomic Health. Certain risks may exist as a result of these acquisition activities, including, among others, that:\n\u2022we may encounter potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or unfavorable conditions in connection with the closing of the acquisitions and the subsequent integration;\n\u2022we may be unable to successfully integrate the acquired business into our business;\n\u2022we may lose key employees;\n\u2022our management\u2019s attention may be diverted;\n\u2022our expenses may be increased and our cash available for operations and other uses may be reduced;\n\u2022we may encounter unforeseen risks associated with contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the acquisitions;\n\u2022we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or do so within the anticipated timeframe;\n\u2022our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations; and\n\u2022the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisitions.\nIn the future, we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses, products, services or technologies. Because we have only made a limited number of acquisitions to date, our ability to do so successfully is unproven. If we do identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to make such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Any acquisitions we make may not strengthen our competitive position, and these transactions may be viewed negatively by investors, healthcare providers, patients and others. In addition to the risks outlined above, we may decide to incur debt in connection with an acquisition or issue our common stock or other securities to the stockholders of the acquired company, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, compliance and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S.\nOur business strategy incorporates international expansion, which includes growing our direct sales and healthcare provider outreach and education capabilities outside of the U.S. and developing our relationships with international payers and distributors. Additionally, we are in the process of developing an IVD version of our Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test, which we expect will be initially made available in Europe. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties in complying with multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, data protection laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u2022significant competition from local and regional product offerings;\n\u2022difficulties in complying with unclear product regulations in various jurisdictions, including the changing regulation in Europe with regard to medical device and IVD regulations;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022complexities associated with managing multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers or patient self-pay systems;\n\u2022logistics and regulations associated with shipping tissue samples or complying with local regulations concerning the analysis of tissue, including infrastructure conditions and transportation delays;\n\u2022limits in our ability to penetrate international markets if we are not able to process tests locally;\n\u2022lack of intellectual property protection in certain markets;\n\u2022financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our tests and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and\n\u2022regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over the activities of our salesforce and distributors that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, its books and records provisions or its anti-bribery provisions, or similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws or regulations, such as the U.K. Anti-bribery Act and the U.K. Criminal Finances Act.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Governmental Regulation and Reimbursement\nWe face uncertainty related to healthcare reform, pricing, coverage and reimbursement, which could reduce our revenue.\nHealthcare reform laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cACA\u201d) and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d), are significantly affecting the U.S. healthcare and medical services industry. Existing legislation, and possible future legal and regulatory changes, including potential repeal or modification of the ACA, elimination of penalties regarding the individual mandate for coverage, or approval of health plans that allow lower levels of coverage for preventive services, could materially change the structure and finances of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices, including our current and future products and services. The ACA has also been the subject of various legal challenges and in December 2018, a federal district court in Texas\nfound that the ACA\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was unconstitutional such that the whole of the ACA is invalid. The decision was appealed and, in December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed certain portions of the district court\u2019s decision,\nbut remanded to the district court to determine if any portions of the ACA may still be valid. If the plaintiffs in this case, or in any other case challenging the ACA, are ultimately successful, insurance coverage for Cologuard could be materially and adversely affected. Any change in reimbursement policy could result in a change in patient cost-sharing, which could adversely affect a provider\u2019s willingness to prescribe and patient\u2019s willingness and ability to use our Cologuard test and any other product or service we may develop. Healthcare reforms, which may intend to reduce healthcare costs, may have the effect of discouraging third-party payers from covering certain kinds of medical products and services, particularly newly developed technologies, such as our Cologuard test or other products or tests we may develop in the future. We cannot predict whether future healthcare reform initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any such future legislation or regulation will have on us. The taxes imposed by new legislation, cost reduction measures and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPAMA presents significant uncertainty for future CMS reimbursement rates for our tests. Because Medicare currently covers a significant number of our patients, any reduction in the CMS reimbursement rate for our tests would negatively affect our revenues and our business prospects. Under PAMA, CMS reimbursement rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are updated every three years, or annually for clinical laboratory tests that are considered \"advanced diagnostic laboratory tests\". The CMS reimbursement rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are updated based on the volume-weighted median of private payer rates for each clinical diagnostic laboratory test based on data submitted by certain applicable laboratories. Based on current regulations, we expect that the current CMS reimbursement rate for our Cologuard and Oncotype DX tests will remain unchanged until December 2021 and then will be reset for calendar years 2022-2024 based on the volume-weighted median of private payer rates for Cologuard during the data collection period from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019. Laboratories that fail to report or erroneously report required payment information may be subject to substantial civil money penalties. There can be no assurance under PAMA that adequate CMS reimbursement rates will continue to be assigned to our tests. Congress could modify or repeal PAMA in the future or CMS could modify regulations under PAMA, and any such action could have the effect of reducing the CMS reimbursement rate for our tests. Further, it is possible that Medicare or other federal payers that provide reimbursement for our tests may suspend, revoke or discontinue coverage at any time, may require co-payments from patients, or may reduce the reimbursement rates payable to us. Any such action could have a negative impact on our revenues.\nCoverage of Cologuard and other screening products that we may develop may also depend, in whole or in part, on whether payers determine, or courts and/or regulatory authorities determine, coverage is required under applicable federal or state laws mandating coverage of certain cancer screening services. For example, Section 2713 of the ACA mandates that certain health insurers cover evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d in the current recommendations of USPSTF without imposing any patient cost-sharing (\u201cACA Mandate\u201d). Similarly, federal regulations require that Medicare Advantage plans cover \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rated preventive services without patient cost-sharing. Following the June 2016 update to the USPSTF colorectal cancer screening recommendation statement, CMS issued an updated Evidence of Coverage notice for Medicare Advantage plans that affirms such plans must include coverage of Cologuard every three years for average risk individuals between the ages of 50 and 75 without patient cost-sharing. While we believe the ACA Mandate requires most health insurers to cover Cologuard for most patients between the ages of 50 and 75 without patient cost-sharing, some health insurers have disagreed and determined not to cover Cologuard and others may take that position in the future. It may be difficult for us or patients to enforce the ACA Mandate directly, and we may need to rely on states to take enforcement action, which they may choose not to do. It is also possible that the ACA Mandate will be repealed or overturned or significantly modified in the future.\nSeveral states have laws mandating coverage for preventive services, such as colorectal cancer screening services, applicable to certain health insurers. However, not all of these laws apply to Cologuard and not all of these laws presently mandate coverage for patients within the 45-49 age range. We and payers may disagree about how these mandates apply to Cologuard and we may find the mandates difficult to enforce. Further, if the ACA is repealed, replaced or overturned, or even if it is not, states may decide to modify their laws, which may include repeal of those coverage mandates that we believe currently apply to Cologuard.\nOutside of the U.S., we largely depend on public or government-controlled payers for coverage of our Oncotype DX tests. As compared to many more routine diagnostic tests, our Oncotype DX tests are more complicated, expensive and are performed in central, specialized lab. In order to accommodate the unique characteristics of our Oncotype DX tests, public payers in certain non-U.S. markets have designed reimbursement frameworks specifically for our tests. These payers could decide to modify or discontinue these special frameworks, potentially leading to lower reimbursement prices or the impossibility of providing the test in the market. These changes could also impose additional administrative burdens on us, such as complex public tendering procedures, or on ordering physicians, which could adversely affect the number of payers covering the test or the number of orders placed. Public payers could condition reimbursement of our tests upon performance of our tests locally or, even in laboratories owned or operated by the payers. Any such change would adversely affect our ability to continue to serve those patients through our centralized labs in Redwood City, California. We are developing an IVD version of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test, which could be performed locally by laboratory partners and in hospitals around the world, however those developments efforts may be unsuccessful and any IVD version we may develop may not be approved by regulators or accepted by payers or patients.\nIf third-party payers, including managed care organizations, do not approve and maintain reimbursement for our Cologuard and Oncotype DX tests at adequate reimbursement rates, our commercial success could be compromised.\nOur commercial success depends, in large part, on the availability of adequate reimbursement from government insurance plans, managed care organizations and private insurance plans. Although we received a positive coverage decision and what we believe is an adequate reimbursement rate from CMS for our Cologuard test, it is also critical that other third-party payers approve and maintain reimbursement for our Cologuard test at adequate reimbursement rates. Healthcare providers may be reluctant to prescribe, and patients may be reluctant to complete, our tests if they are not confident that patients will be reimbursed for our tests.\nThird-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new healthcare products. As a result, there is uncertainty surrounding the future level of reimbursement, if any, for our current tests and any new tests we may develop. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend on a number of factors, including a payer\u2019s determination that tests using our technologies are: sufficiently sensitive and specific; not experimental or investigational; approved or recommended by the major guidelines organizations; subject to applicable federal or state coverage mandates; reliable, safe and effective; medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; and cost-effective.\nOur Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test has received certain negative assessments in the past relating to technology criteria for clinical effectiveness and appropriateness for use in patients with N+ disease, and our tests may receive similar negative assessments in the future. Since each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy to reimburse our tests, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. To date, we have positive coverage determinations for our Oncotype DX breast cancer test for N-, ER+ patients from most third party payers in the United States through contracts, agreements or policy decisions. We cannot be certain that coverage for this test will be provided in the future by additional third party payers or that existing contracts, agreements or policy decisions or reimbursement levels, including tests processed as out of network, will remain in place or be fulfilled within existing terms and provisions.\nWe have obtained limited reimbursement from private third-party payers in the U.S. for our Oncotype DX colon cancer test and for our Oncotype DX breast cancer test for N+ and DCIS patients. Until further clinical data is presented, our N+ and DCIS indication for our breast cancer test and our colon cancer test may be considered investigational by payers and therefore may not be covered under their reimbursement policies.\nWe have obtained Medicare reimbursement coverage for our Oncotype DX GPS prostate cancer test for low and very-low risk patients and for favorable intermediate risk patients. However, we may not be able to obtain Medicare reimbursement coverage for this test for patients with different risk profiles or obtain other third-party payer reimbursement for our tests for patients with colon or prostate cancer or with N+ breast cancer or DCIS that is similar to the coverage we have obtained for our invasive breast cancer test for N-, ER+ patients.\nUnder the terms of the coverage determinations for our Oncotype DX GPS prostate cancer test, coverage for the test for patients with certain risk profiles is limited to tests ordered by healthcare providerns who agree to participate in a Certification and Training Registry, or CTR, and to provide certain information about Medicare beneficiaries who receive our test. If healthcare providers do not timely submit necessary information as part of participating in the CTR, the timeframe in which we are reimbursed and recognize revenue for those tests may be accordingly delayed.\nFrom time to time payers change processes that may affect timely payment. These changes may result in uneven cash flow or impact the timing of revenue recognized with these payers. Additionally, on a five-year rotational basis, Medicare requests bids for its regional Medicare Administrative Contractor, or MAC, services. In September 2013, the claims processing function for the jurisdiction in which we process Oncotype DX tests transitioned from Palmetto to Noridian Healthcare Solutions, although coverage determinations for those tests remain with Palmetto at this time through the MolDx Program. Future changes in the MAC with jurisdiction over our tests may affect our ability to obtain Medicare coverage and reimbursement for tests for which we have or may seek coverage.\nMoreover, coverage determinations and reimbursement rates are subject to change, and we cannot guarantee that even if we initially achieve adequate coverage and reimbursement rates for our Cologuard and Oncotype DX tests, they will be continue to apply in the future. As noted above, under PAMA, our Medicare reimbursement rates will be subject to adjustment based on our volume-weighted median commercial reimbursement rate. Any reduction in our Medicare reimbursement rates could significantly and adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven where a third-party payer agrees to cover one of our tests, other factors may have a significant impact on the actual reimbursement we receive from that payer. For example, if we do not have a contract with a given payer, we may be deemed an \u201cout-of-network\u201d provider by that payer, which could result in the payer allocating a portion of the cost of the test to the patient, notwithstanding any applicable coverage mandate. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to enter into, or maintain, a network contract with a given payer, and we expect that our network status with a given payer may change from time to time for a variety of reasons, many of which may be outside our control. To the extent one of our tests is out of network for a given payer, healthcare providers may be less likely to prescribe that test for their patients and their patients may be less likely to comply with those prescriptions that are written. Also, some payers may require that they give prior authorization for a test before they are willing to pay for it or review claims post-service to ensure the service was medically appropriate for specific patients. Prior authorization and other medical management practices may require that we, patients or healthcare providers provide the payer with extensive medical records and other information. Prior authorization and other medical management practices impose a significant additional cost on us, may be difficult to comply with given our position as a laboratory that generally does not have direct access to patient medical records, may make healthcare providers less likely to prescribe our tests for their patients, and may make patients less likely to comply with healthcare provider orders for our tests, all or any of which may have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nBecause of Medicare billing rules or changes in Medicare billing rules and processes, we may not receive reimbursement for all tests provided to Medicare patients or may experience delays in receiving payments.\nUnder Medicare billing rules, payment for our Oncotype DX tests performed on Medicare beneficiaries who were hospital patients at the time the tumor tissue samples were obtained and whose tests were ordered less than 14 days from discharge must be bundled into the payment that the hospital receives for the services provided. Effective January 1, 2018, CMS changed its rules to permit laboratories that perform molecular pathology tests on specimens collected during a hospital outpatient stay to bill Medicare directly for such tests if they were performed following a hospital outpatient's discharge from the hospital outpatient department. The rule remains unchanged with respect to payment for our Oncotype DX tests performed on Medicare beneficiaries who were hospital inpatients at the time the tumor tissue was collected and whose tests were ordered less than 14 days from discharge - payment for those tests must be bundled into the payment that the hospital receives for its services provided. In these circumstances, hospitals are required to furnish services such as our tests as \u201cservices furnished under arrangements between a provider and an outside vendor\u201d and only the hospital may bill Medicare for such tests. Under these circumstances, where the date of service for Medicare billing purposes is the date the specimen was collected and such date is within 14 days of inpatient discharge, we are required to bill hospitals for such tests. We refer to this rule, as it has been in effect and most recently amended as of January 1, 2018, as the Medicare Date of Service billing regulation.\nThese billing rules may lead to confusion regarding whether Medicare provides adequate reimbursement for our tests, and could discourage providers from ordering our tests for Medicare patients or even non-Medicare patients. In addition, changes in Medicare billing rules and processes could result in delays in receiving payments or receiving payments that are less than the original invoice. When hospitals disclaim responsibility for, or delay payment of, our bills for tests affected by the Medicare Date of Service rule, and when our collection efforts are unsuccessful, we may be forced to accept payments from hospitals that are less than the original invoice or we may be unable to collect from hospitals at all. Our inability to successfully collect payment from a hospital financially responsible for a test affected by the Medicare Date of Service rule may lead us to reject orders from that hospital that implicate the Medicare Date of Service billing regulation until any outstanding bills are paid. Compared to our breast cancer tests, a greater proportion of eligible patients for our colon and prostate Oncotype DX tests are covered by Medicare. We cannot assure you that Medicare will continue the Medicare Date of Service billing regulation in its\ncurrent form, that Medicare will not seek to include molecular pathology tests in hospital outpatient bundling rules in the future, or that other payers will not adopt similar billing rules. As described in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, the United States Department of Justice is investigating Genomic Health\u2019s compliance with the Medicare Date of Service billing regulation. An adverse outcome could include our being required to pay treble damages, incur civil and criminal penalties, paying attorneys\u2019 fees, entering into a corporate integrity agreement, being excluded from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and other adverse actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement for our Oncotype DX tests outside of the U.S., our ability to expand internationally will be compromised.\nThe majority of our international Oncotype DX breast, prostate and colon cancer test revenues come from direct payer reimbursement, payments from our distributors, and patient self-pay. In many countries outside of the U.S., various coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are required for our tests to be available to patients. We expect that it will take several years to establish broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests with payers in countries outside of the U.S., and our efforts may not be successful.\nEven if public or private reimbursement is obtained, it may cover competing tests, or the reimbursement may be conditioned upon local performance of the tests or other requirements we may have difficulty satisfying. We are developing an IVD version of our Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test. We intend for the IVD version to be performed locally by laboratory partners and in hospitals. However, delays or failures in the development, validation, regulatory approval, or commercialization of the IVD device could have a significant negative effect on the business in countries requiring local performance. Even if we are able to successfully launch, an IVD version of our Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test outside of the U.S., an IVD version of our test may be less commercially successful than we would hope. Local laboratories may not perform the IVD test with the same level of quality as we do in our centralized labs in Redwood City, California, which could damage the reputation of our tests and our company. Also, our costs to provide an IVD version of our Oncotype DX tests could be higher than our costs to provide our current versions, while our reimbursement rates for IVD tests could be lower.\nReimbursement levels outside of the U.S. may vary considerably from the domestic reimbursement amounts we receive. In addition, because we rely on distributors to obtain reimbursement for our tests in certain countries outside of the U.S., to the extent we do not have direct reimbursement arrangements with payers, we may not be able to retain reimbursement coverage in those countries if our agreement with a distributor is terminated or expires, if a distributor fails to pay us or for other reasons. We may also be negatively affected by the financial instability of, and austerity measures implemented by, several countries in the European Union and elsewhere.\nIf we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or similar state laws, that failure could adversely affect any future payer consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale and/or marketing of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe and certain laboratories with whom we collaborate are subject to federal and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. Federal CLIA requirements and laws of certain states, including New York, impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. Some state laws restrict laboratory marketing activities, which may adversely affect our ability to market our laboratory services. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators, and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If we or our third party partners fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any payer consideration of our current or future technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale and/or marketing of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe must maintain FDA approval for Cologuard and compliance with applicable FDA requirements; failure to maintain compliance with FDA requirements may prevent or delay the development, marketing or manufacturing of our Cologuard test, or future improvements to that test.\nAs a condition of the FDA approval of our Cologuard test, we were required to conduct a post-approval study. We anticipate that the post-approval study will conclude and final results presented to FDA in late 2020. The study has required, and will continue to require, significant funding and resources. There is a risk that the FDA may modify or withdraw the approval of Cologuard if the results of this post-approval study are not satisfactory or are inconsistent with previous studies. We have relied on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct the post-approval study. We have limited control over the activities of these third parties and the post-approval study may be delayed or halted prior to its completion for reasons outside our control.\nAdditionally, our Madison, Wisconsin manufacturing and laboratory facilities are periodically subject to inspection by the FDA and other governmental agencies to ensure they meet production and quality requirements. Operations at these facilities could be interrupted or halted if the FDA or other governmental agency deems the findings of such inspections unsatisfactory.\nFurther, failure to comply with FDA or other regulatory requirements regarding the development, marketing, promotion, manufacturing and distribution of our tests could result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizures of our products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, restrictions on labeling and promotion, termination of ongoing research, disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution.\nIf we do not meet applicable regulatory or quality standards, our products may be subject to recall, and, under certain circumstances, we may be required to notify applicable regulatory authorities about a recall. In 2017, we recalled one of the components of our Cologuard test kit and circumstances may arise that cause us to recall other products or components used in connection with our Cologuard test. Any such recalls could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide the Cologuard test, which in turn would adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur inability to obtain without delay any necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new medical devices, or improvements to or expanded indications for our current offerings, could prevent, delay or adversely impact future product commercialization.\nWe may develop new tests that are regulated by the FDA as medical devices or laboratory developed tests. Unless otherwise exempted, medical devices must receive either FDA regulatory approval or clearance before being marketed in the U.S. The FDA determines whether a medical device will require either regulatory approval or clearance based on statutory criteria that include the risk associated with the device and whether the device is similar to an existing, legally marketed product. The process to obtain either regulatory approval or clearance will likely be costly, time-consuming and uncertain. However, we believe the regulatory approval process is generally more challenging than the clearance process. Even if we design a product that we expect to be eligible for the regulatory clearance process, the FDA may require that the product undergo the regulatory approval process. There can be no assurance that the FDA will ever permit us to market any new product that we develop. Even if regulatory approval or clearance is granted, such approval may include significant limitations on indicated uses, which could materially and adversely affect the prospects of any new medical device.\nFDA regulatory approval or clearance is not just required for new medical devices we develop, but would also be required for certain enhancements we may seek to make to our Cologuard test.\nDelays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals could materially delay or prevent us from commercializing our products or result in substantial additional costs that could decrease our profitability. In addition, even if we receive FDA clearance or approval for a new or enhanced product, the FDA may condition, withdraw or materially modify its clearance or approval.\nIf the FDA were to change its position with respect to its regulation of the laboratory developed tests we offer or may seek to offer in the future, we could incur substantial costs and time delays associated with meeting requirements for pre-market clearance or approval or we could experience decreased demand for or reimbursement of our tests.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents and other medical devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing. Clinical laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, frequently develop internal laboratory developed tests, or \u201cLDTs\u201d to provide diagnostic results to customers. LDTs are subject to CMS oversight through its enforcement of CLIA. The FDA has also claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but indicates that it has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs offered by CLIA-certified laboratories, and has not subjected these tests to the panoply of FDA rules and regulations governing medical devices. In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) like our Cologuard test are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. We believe that our Oncotype DX tests are not diagnostic kits and also believe that they are LDTs that are subject to regulation under CLIA and applicable state laws. As a result, we believe our Oncotype DX products fall within the scope of FDA's exercise of enforcement discretion and should not be subject to FDA oversight or review under current FDA guidelines. Packaging requirements for receipt of tumor tissue for our Oncotype DX products may be subject to regulation under Department of Transportation, International Air Transport Association, and other state, regional, or local laws.\nAt various times since 2006, the FDA has issued documents outlining its intent to require varying levels of FDA oversight of many LDTs, including our tests. For example, in October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents describing a proposed risk-based framework under which the FDA might regulate LDTs. The FDA\u2019s draft framework proposed, among other things, premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared diagnostics currently on the market. In November 2015, the FDA issued a report citing evidence for the need for additional regulation of LDTs and stated the FDA is continuing to work to finalize premarket review requirements for LDTs. However, in November 2016 the FDA announced it would not issue a final guidance for LDTs. In January 2017, the FDA issued a Discussion Paper on LDTs, which confirmed it would not finalize its guidance on the regulation of LDTs to allow more time for public discussion and time for the congressional authorizing committees to develop a legislative solution. It is unclear at this time if or when the FDA will finalize its plans to end enforcement discretion for LDTs; however, the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time.\nIn addition, legislative proposals addressing oversight of LDTs have been introduced in previous Congresses, and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time in the future. Notably, in December 2018, Congress released a bill, the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development Act, which would impose a risk-based regulatory framework for LDTs that would require certain pre-approvals through FDA, similar to past FDA proposed frameworks for the regulation of LDTs. However, it remains unknown whether Congress will enact this or any other legislation regulating LDTs and, if so, what regulatory approach Congress and FDA will adopt. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including pre-market review, will not be required in the future for our Oncotype DX tests or new tests we develop, whether through finalization of guidance issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. It is possible that legislation will be enacted into law or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to continue to offer our Oncotype DX tests or to develop and introduce new LDTs.\nIf pre-market review is required for our current LDTs, our business could be negatively impacted in the U.S. until such review is completed and clearance or approval is obtained, and the FDA could require that we stop selling our tests pending pre-market clearance or approval.\nIf our Oncotype DX tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the regulatory status of such tests, if they are labeled investigational by the FDA, or if labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are more limited than the claims we currently make, orders or reimbursement may decline. The regulatory approval process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and submitting a pre-market clearance notice or filing a pre-market approval application with the FDA. If pre-market review is required by the FDA, there can be no assurance that our LDTs will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, nor can there be assurance that the labeling claims cleared or approved by the FDA will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our LDTs. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations with respect to our current LDTs would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to inspection by and the regulatory requirements of the FDA, for example registration and listing and medical device reporting, and penalties in the event we fail to comply with these requirements. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA pre-market review of our LDTs if we determine that doing so would be appropriate.\nWe cannot predict the ultimate timing or form of final FDA guidance, legislation or regulation of LDTs and the potential impact on our existing tests, our tests in development or the materials used to perform our tests. While we qualify all materials used in our LDTs according to CLIA regulations, we cannot be certain that the FDA will not enact rules or guidance documents that could impact our ability to purchase certain materials necessary for the performance of our LDTs, such as products labeled for research use only. Should any of the reagents obtained by us from suppliers and used in conducting our LDTs be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of testing or delaying and limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform testing.\nIf we were required to conduct additional clinical trials prior to continuing to sell our current LDTs or launching any other LDTs we may develop, those trials could result in delays or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances, which could harm our business.\nIf the FDA decides to regulate any of our LDTs, it may require additional pre-market clinical testing before clearing or approving such tests for commercial sales. Such pre-market clinical testing could delay the commencement or completion of other clinical testing, significantly increase our test development costs, delay commercialization of any future LTDs, and interrupt sales of our current LTDs. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial.\nWe may find it necessary to engage contract research organizations to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials, which might increase the cost and complexity of those trials. We may also depend on clinical investigators, medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform certain aspects of the trials. If these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our clinical trials may have to be extended, delayed or terminated. Many of these factors would be beyond our control. We may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without undue delays or considerable expenditures. If there are delays in testing or approvals as a result of the failure to perform by third parties, our research and development costs would increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our LDTs. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain relationships with these parties on favorable terms, if at all. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our LDTs, or to achieve sustained profitability.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations, and any governmental enforcement action may materially affect our financial condition and business operations.\nWe are subject to regulation in the United States by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, as well as in other jurisdictions outside of the United States, including:\n\u2022Medicare billing and payment regulations applicable to clinical laboratories;\n\u2022the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and state anti-kickback prohibitions and the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (\u201cEKRA\u201d);\n\u2022the Federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the Stark Law, and the state equivalents;\n\u2022the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018;\n\u2022the Medicare civil money penalty and exclusion requirements;\n\u2022the Federal False Claims Act civil and criminal penalties and state equivalents; and\n\u2022the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Anti-bribery Act, the GDPR, and the E.U. In Vitro Diagnostic Device Regulation, all of which apply or will apply to our international activities.\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices have increased their scrutiny over the healthcare industry in recent years. The U.S. Congress, Department of Justice, Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Defense have all issued subpoenas and other requests for information to conduct investigations of, and commenced civil and criminal litigation against, healthcare companies, related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance, product promotional practices, and documentation, coding and billing practices. In addition, the Federal False Claims Act and state equivalents have led to whistleblowers filing numerous qui tam civil lawsuits against healthcare companies, in part, because a whistleblower can receive a portion of any amount obtained by the government through such a lawsuit.\nGovernmental enforcement action or qui tam civil litigation against us may result in material costs and occupy significant management resources, even if we ultimately prevail. In addition, governmental enforcement action may result in substantial fines, penalties or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs and entry into corporate integrity agreements with governmental agencies, which could entail significant obligations and costs. As described further in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, we are being investigated by the United States Department of Justice related to our compliance with the Medicare Date of Service billing regulation. An adverse outcome could include our being required to pay treble damages, incur attorneys\u2019 fees and penalties, and suffer other adverse consequences such as a corporate integrity agreement that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws. In the ordinary course of our business, we conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. Our compliance is also subject to governmental review. The growth of our business and sales organization and our expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, we could be required to refund payments received by us, and we could lose the ability to bill for our tests and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nOur business is subject to various complex laws and regulations applicable to clinical diagnostics. We could be subject to significant fines and penalties if we or our partners fail to comply with these laws and regulations.\nAs a provider of clinical diagnostic products and services, we and our partners are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business. In particular, the clinical laboratory and healthcare industry is subject to significant governmental certification and licensing regulations, as well as federal, state and foreign laws regarding:\n\u2022test ordering and billing practices;\n\u2022marketing, sales and pricing practices;\n\u2022health information privacy and security, including HIPAA and comparable state laws;\n\u2022insurance;\n\u2022anti-markup legislation; and\n\u2022consumer protection.\nWe are also required to comply with FDA regulations, including with respect to our labeling and promotion activities. In addition, advertising of our tests is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and advertising of laboratory services is regulated by certain state laws. Violation of any FDA requirement could result in enforcement actions, such as seizures, injunctions, civil penalties and criminal prosecutions, and violation of any FTC or state law requirement could result in injunctions and other associated remedies, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Most states also have similar regulatory and enforcement authority for devices. Additionally, most foreign countries have authorities comparable to the FDA and processes for obtaining marketing approvals. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals, and complying with all laws and regulations, may subject us to similar risks and delays as those we could experience under FDA, FTC and state regulation. We incur various costs in complying and overseeing compliance with these laws and regulations. The growth of our business and sales organization, the acquisition of additional businesses or products and services and our expansion outside of the U.S. may increase the potential of violating these laws, regulations or our internal policies and procedures.\nHealthcare policy has been a subject of extensive discussion in the executive and legislative branches of the federal and many state governments and healthcare laws and regulations are subject to change. Development of the existing commercialization strategy for our tests and planned development of products in our pipeline has been based on existing healthcare policies. We cannot predict what additional changes, if any, will be proposed or adopted or the effect that such proposals or adoption may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we or our partners, including Pfizer, fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could incur significant fines and penalties and our reputation and prospects could suffer. Additionally, any such partners could be forced to cease offering our products and services in certain jurisdictions, which could materially disrupt our business. As described further in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Genomic Health's compliance with the Medicare Date of Service billing regulation. An adverse outcome could include our being required to pay treble damages, incur civil and criminal penalties, paying attorneys\u2019 fees, entering into a corporate integrity agreement, being excluded from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and other adverse actions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to billing complexities in the diagnostic and laboratory service industry, we may not be able to collect payment for the tests we perform.\nBilling for diagnostic and laboratory services is a complex process. Laboratories bill many different payers including patients, private insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. We are continuing to work with third-party payers to cover and reimburse our tests. If we are unsuccessful, we may not receive payment for the tests we perform for patients on a timely basis, if at all, and we may not be able to provide services for patients with certain healthcare plans. We may have to litigate to enforce coverage obligations under Medicare laws and laws that mandate coverage for certain screening or diagnostic tests or to enforce contractual coverage obligations. Such litigation may be costly, may divert management attention from other responsibilities, may cause payers, including those not directly involved in the litigation, to resist contracting with us, and may ultimately prove unsuccessful for a variety of reasons. We may face lawsuits by government or commercial payers if they believe they have overpaid us for our test services or as a result of other circumstances. We may face write-offs of doubtful accounts, disputes with payers and patients, and long collection cycles. We may face patient dissatisfaction, complaints or lawsuits, including to the extent our tests are not fully covered by insurers and patients become responsible for all or part of the price of the test. As a result, patient demand for our tests could be adversely affected. To the extent patients express dissatisfaction with our billing practices to their healthcare providers, those healthcare providers may be less likely to prescribe our tests for other patients, and our business would be adversely affected.\nEven if payers do agree to cover our tests, our billing and collections process may be complicated by the following and other factors, which may be beyond our control:\n\u2022disputes among payers as to which payer is responsible for payment;\n\u2022disparity in coverage among various payers or among various healthcare plans offered by a single payer;\n\u2022payer medical management requirements, including prior authorization requirements;\n\u2022differing information and billing requirements among payers; and\n\u2022failure by patients or healthcare providers to provide complete and correct billing information.\nSometimes, when we have a contract with a commercial payer to cover our tests, we are not permitted to bill patients insured by that payer for amounts beyond deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance as prescribed in the coverage agreement between the payer and the patients. Therefore, when such contracted payers do not pay us our full, contracted rate for a test, for example, for failure to satisfy prior-authorization or other payer medical management requirements, we may not be permitted to collect the balance from the patient and our business is adversely impacted.\nThe uncertainty of receiving payment for our tests and complex laboratory billing processes could negatively affect our business and our operating results.\nSome of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting \u2018kickbacks\u2019 and false or fraudulent claims.\nIn addition to FDA marketing and promotion restrictions, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the healthcare product and service industry and to regulate billing practices and financial relationships with healthcare providers, hospitals and other healthcare providers. These laws include a federal law commonly known as the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce healthcare providers or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to referrals, products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices and providers of laboratory services by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, that may be used with hospitals, healthcare providers, laboratories and other potential purchasers or prescribers of medical devices and laboratory services. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed.\nIn 2018, Congress passed EKRA as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. Similar to the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, EKRA imposes criminal penalties for knowing or willful payment or offer, or solicitation or receipt, of any remuneration, whether directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for the referral or inducement of laboratory testing (among other healthcare services) unless a specific exception applies. However, unlike the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, EKRA is not limited to services covered by federal or state healthcare programs but applies more broadly to services covered by \u201chealthcare benefit programs,\u201d including commercial insurers. As currently drafted, EKRA potentially expands the universe of arrangements that could be subject to government enforcement under federal fraud and abuse laws. In addition, while the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law includes certain exceptions that are widely relied upon in the healthcare industry, not all of those same exceptions apply under EKRA. Because EKRA is a relatively new law, there is no agency guidance or court precedent to indicate how and to what extent it will be applied and enforced. We cannot assure you that our relationships with healthcare providers, sales representatives, hospitals, customers, or any other party will not be subject to scrutiny or will survive regulatory challenge under EKRA.\nAdditionally, to avoid liability under federal false claims laws, we must carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, proactively monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of Medicare claims and payments received, diligently investigate any credible information indicating that we may have received an overpayment, and promptly return any overpayments. Medicare payments are subject to audit, including through the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program, and payments may be recouped by CMS if it is determined that they were improperly made. Currently, a significant percentage of our revenues are generated by payments from Medicare. The federal anti-kickback statute and certain false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. While we continually strive to comply with these complex requirements, interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing and billing practices are constantly evolving and even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and prospects. Our failure to comply with applicable laws could result in various adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, including the exclusion of our products and services from government programs and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.\nSome of our activities may subject us to risks under foreign laws prohibiting \u2018kickbacks\u2019 as well as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nMany countries in which we offer our tests in have anti-kickback regulations prohibiting providers from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any national healthcare program. In situations involving healthcare providers employed by state-funded institutions or national healthcare agencies, violation of the local anti-kickback law may also constitute a violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA.\nThe FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual, business entity or employee of a U.S. business entity from offering or providing, directly or through a third party, including the distributors we rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign government official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violates local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that reports to the SEC to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We are also required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.\nThe standard of intent and knowledge in the anti-bribery cases is minimal, and intent and knowledge are usually inferred from that fact that bribery took place. The accounting provisions do not require intent. Violations of the FCPA\u2019s anti-bribery provisions for corporations and other business entities may result in a fine of up to $2 million and officers, directors, stockholders, employees, and agents are subject to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Other countries, including the United Kingdom and other OECD Anti-Bribery Convention members, have similar anti-corruption regulations, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act.\nCompliance with the HIPAA security, privacy and breach notification regulations may increase our costs.\nThe HIPAA privacy, security and breach notification regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d) by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of PHI. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:\n\u2022the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and our healthcare operations activities;\n\u2022a patient\u2019s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;\n\u2022requirements to notify individuals if there is a breach of their PHI;\n\u2022the contents of notices of privacy practices for PHI;\n\u2022administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI; and\n\u2022the protection of computing systems maintaining electronic PHI.\nWe have implemented practices intended to meet the requirements of the HIPAA privacy, security and breach notification regulations, as required by law. We are required to comply with federal privacy, security and breach notification regulations as well as varying state privacy, security and breach notification laws and regulations, which may be more stringent than federal HIPAA requirements. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, we must comply with the laws of those countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient identifiable data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment, healthcare operations and certain other specified disclosures such as public health and governmental oversight of the healthcare industry.\nHIPAA provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. Computer networks are always vulnerable to breach and unauthorized persons may in the future be able to exploit weaknesses in the security systems of our computer networks and gain access to PHI. Additionally, we share PHI with third-parties who are legally obligated to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of PHI. Unauthorized persons may be able to gain access to PHI stored in such third-parties computer networks. Any wrongful use or disclosure of PHI by us or such third-parties, including disclosure due to data theft or unauthorized access to our or our third-parties computer networks, could subject us to fines or penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, we could also incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct any future studies of our technologies that may be required by the FDA or other US or foreign regulatory bodies, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe expect to rely on third parties such as contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct studies, including the post-approval studies required by the FDA for our Cologuard test. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities will reduce our control over these activities. These third-parties may not complete activities on schedule or conduct studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design. Our reliance on third\nparties that we do not control will not relieve us of our requirement to prepare, and ensure our compliance with, various procedures required under good clinical practices, even though third-party contract research organizations may prepare and comply with their own, comparable procedures. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our studies may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain a required regulatory approval.\nWe are subject to increasingly complex taxation rules and practices, which may affect how we conduct our business and our results of operations.\nAs our business grows, we are required to comply with increasingly complex taxation rules and practices. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and in foreign tax jurisdictions as we continue to expand internationally. The development of our tax strategies requires additional expertise and may impact how we conduct our business. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Furthermore, we provide for certain tax liabilities that involve significant judgment. We are subject to the examination of our tax returns by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which could focus on our intercompany transfer pricing methodology as well as other matters. If our tax strategies are ineffective or we are not in compliance with domestic and international tax laws, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Product Development, Commercialization and Sales of our Products\nWe have finite resources, which may restrict our success in commercializing our Cologuard and Oncotype DX tests and other products we may develop, and we may be unsuccessful in entering into or maintaining third-party arrangements to support our internal efforts.\nTo grow our business as planned, we must expand our sales, marketing and customer support capabilities, which will involve developing and administering our commercial infrastructure and/or collaborative commercial arrangements and partnerships. We must also maintain satisfactory arrangements for the manufacture and distribution of our tests. Also, we operate CLIA certified lab facilities to process our tests and provide patient results.\nPrior to our combination with Genomic Health, we only had one commercial test. We have limited experience managing a sales force, customer support operation and operating manufacturing and clinical laboratory operations for multiple products in multiple locations with divergent regulatory requirements. We may encounter difficulties retaining and managing the specialized workforce these activities require. We may seek to partner with others to assist us with any or all of these functions. However, we may be unable to find appropriate third parties with whom to enter into these arrangements.\nOur sales efforts have grown in size and complexity. We now maintain sales forces with primary care, oncology, GI, urology and women's health call points. We must coordinate among our internal sales teams, as well as with Pfizer's, to ensure that we are effectively and compliantly marketing our tests.\nIf we are unable to deploy and maintain effective sales, marketing and medical affairs capabilities, we will have difficulty achieving market awareness and selling our products and services.\nTo achieve commercial success for our Cologuard and Oncotype DX tests and our future products and services, we must continue to develop and grow our sales, marketing and medical affairs organizations to effectively explain to healthcare providers the reliability, effectiveness and benefits of our current and future products and services as compared to alternatives. We may not be able to successfully manage our dispersed or inside sales forces or our sales force may not be effective. Because of the competition for their services, we may be unable to hire, partner with or retain additional qualified sales representatives or marketing or medical affairs personnel, either as our employees or independent contractors or through independent sales or other third-party organizations. Market competition for commercial, marketing and medical affairs talent is significant, and we may not be able to hire or retain such talent on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nEstablishing and maintaining sales, marketing and medical affairs capabilities will be expensive and time-consuming. Our expenses associated with maintaining our sales force may be disproportional compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of the Cologuard and Oncotype DX tests or any future products or services.\nThe success of our Cologuard test, our Oncotype DX tests and any other screening or diagnostic product or service we may offer or develop will depend on the degree of market acceptance by healthcare providers, patients, healthcare payers and others in the medical community.\nOur products and services may not gain market acceptance by healthcare providers, healthcare payers and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of our Cologuard test, our Oncotype DX tests, and other products and services that we may offer will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022demonstrated performance and utility;\n\u2022price;\n\u2022the availability and attractiveness of alternative tests;\n\u2022the willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products and services;\n\u2022the ease of use of our ordering process for healthcare providers; and\n\u2022adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nOur assumptions regarding the market opportunity for our products or services may not prove true. For example, we estimate the potential market opportunity for Cologuard assuming, among other things, the size of the screening population, the adoption rate in the screening population and a three-year screening interval. Although ACS guidelines and others recommend a three-year screening interval for Cologuard and CMS has determined that Medicare will cover the test at this interval, the label for Cologuard does not specify a three-year interval and healthcare providers, healthcare payers, the FDA and other regulators and opinion leaders could recommend a different interval. Further, patients may not adhere to any recommended testing interval.\nRecommendations, guidelines and quality metrics issued by various organizations may significantly affect payers\u2019 willingness to cover, and healthcare providers\u2019 willingness to prescribe, our products.\nSecuring influential recommendations, inclusion in healthcare guidelines and inclusion in quality measures are keys to our healthcare provider and payer engagement strategies. These guidelines, recommendations and quality metrics may shape payers\u2019 coverage decisions and healthcare providers\u2019 cancer screening procedures.\nThe U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (\"USPSTF\"), a panel of primary care providers and epidemiologists and other national experts funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, makes influential recommendations on clinical preventative services. In June 2016, USPSTF issued an updated recommendation statement for colorectal cancer screening, and gave an \"A\" grade to colorectal cancer screening starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75. The statement specifies seven screening methods, including FIT-DNA (which is Cologuard). USPSTF updates its screening recommendations periodically, approximately every five to eight years. USPSTF distributed a draft research plan for public comment on January 3, 2019 and released a final research plan on May 16, 2019. The research plan will be used to guide a systematic review of the evidence by researchers at an evidence-based practice center. The resulting evidence review will form the basis of the next update to the USPSTF recommendation statement regarding colorectal cancer screening. We cannot be certain when USPSTF will next update its colorectal cancer screening recommendations, whether updated recommendations will continue to give an \u201cA\u201d grade to colorectal cancer screening between the ages of 50 and 75, whether updated recommendations will lower the screening commencement age to 45, whether updated recommendations will continue to include FIT-DNA, whether updated recommendations may take a different format, including by ranking or tiering different methodologies and positioning FIT-DNA below other methodologies, or whether updated recommendations will include new technologies that are competitive with Cologuard and that may have greater appeal to healthcare providers, patients and payers. Any update to the USPSTF recommendations that may have the effect of reducing screening, that does not include FIT-DNA in a favorable manner, or that adds new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, while FDA expanded Cologuard\u2019s indication in September 2019 to include average-risk individuals ages 45-49 and while ACS recommends colorectal cancer screening for that population, if updated USPSTF recommendations do not recommend that screening commence at age 45, adoption of screening generally, and Cologuard specifically, within the 45-49 age band may be limited.\nMaintaining a high USPSTF recommendation for Cologuard may have certain potentially significant implications. For example, the ACA mandates that certain non-grandfathered health insurers cover evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d in the current recommendations of USPSTF without imposing any patient cost-sharing. Similarly, federal regulations require that Medicare Advantage plans cover \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d graded preventive services without patient cost-sharing. Following the updated 2016 USPSTF recommendation statement, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\n(\u201cCMS\u201d) issued an updated Evidence of Coverage notice for Medicare Advantage plans that affirms such plans must include coverage of Cologuard every three years without patient cost-sharing. While we believe the ACA Mandate requires certain health insurers to cover Cologuard for individuals between the ages of 50 and 75 without patient cost-sharing some health insurers have disagreed. Enforcement of the ACA Mandate is difficult and depends on state, federal or other third-party enforcement actions that we do not control. Further, a court or regulatory agency may agree with arguments that have been made, or that may in the future be made, by insurers and determine that the ACA Mandate does not require that they cover Cologuard or may otherwise interpret the ACA Mandate in a manner unfavorable to us. Also, Congress may modify or repeal all or part of the ACA, and any such modification or repeal may repeal or limit the ACA Mandate for preventive services. Additionally, the ACA has also been the subject of various legal challenges and in December 2018, a federal district court in Texas found that the ACA\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was unconstitutional such that the whole of the ACA is invalid. The decision was appealed and, in December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed certain portions of the district court\u2019s decision, but remanded to the district court to determine if any portions of the ACA may still be valid. If the plaintiffs in this case, or in any other case challenging the ACA, are ultimately successful, insurance coverage for Cologuard could be materially and adversely affected. If the ACA Mandate for preventive services is repealed, overturned or modified, if the ACA Mandate is determined not to require coverage of Cologuard, if the ACA Mandate is otherwise interpreted in a manner unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to influence or secure effective enforcement of the ACA Mandate, even if it is held to require coverage of Cologuard, our business prospects may be adversely affected.\nWhile we believe the ACA Mandate requires certain health insurers to cover Cologuard for individuals between the ages of 50 and 75, the ACA Mandate does not currently extend to screening within the 45-49 age group because USPSTF currently does not currently recommend screening for that group. If USPSTF does not include the 45-49 age group in its updated recommendations, reimbursement for Cologuard within that group would not be compelled by the ACA and therefore might be adversely affected.\nThe healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment and value-based purchasing of healthcare services. Some government and private payers are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate payments for healthcare services based on the achievement of documented quality metrics, cost efficiencies or patient outcomes. Payers may look to quality measures such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance (\u201cNCQA\u201d), Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (\u201cHEDIS\u201d) and the CMS Medicare Advantage Star Ratings to assess quality of care. These measures are intended to provide incentives to service providers to deliver the same or better results while consuming fewer resources. Cologuard has been included NCQA's HEDIS measures since 2017 and in CMS's Medicare Advantage Star Ratings since 2018. If for some reason Cologuard was removed from, or not included in, HEDIS, the Star Ratings or other quality metrics, payers may be less inclined to reimburse our Cologuard test at adequate levels, if at all, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, if Cologuard was removed from, or not included in, HEDIS, the Star Ratings or other quality metrics, healthcare providers may not earn quality credit for prescribing Cologuard and therefore may be less inclined to do so. If Cologuard fails to maintain its current position within any updated USPSTF colorectal cancer screening recommendations, Cologuard may, as a result, become excluded from the HEDIS measures and the Star Ratings.\nWe expect to make significant investments to research and develop new cancer tests, which may not be successful.\nWe are seeking to increase Cologuard\u2019s specificity by substituting new biomarkers and to develop a pipeline for future products and services, including screening and diagnostic tests for liver, pancreatic, esophageal, lung and other types of cancers. Also, we are working to develop an IVD version of our Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test. We expect to incur significant expenses on these development efforts, but they may not be successful.\nDeveloping new or improved cancer tests is a speculative and risky endeavor. Candidate products and services that may initially show promise may fail to achieve the desired results in larger clinical studies or may not achieve acceptable levels of clinical accuracy. Any cancer screening test we develop will need to demonstrate in clinical studies a high level of accuracy. Because cancer screening tests seek to identify relatively rare occurrences, if in a clinical study a candidate product or service fails to identify even a small number of cancer cases, the sensitivity rate may be materially and adversely affected and we may have to abandon the candidate product or service. Any cancer diagnostic test we develop will need to address an unmet medical need with accurate performance and utility.\nWe may need to explore a number of different biomarker combinations, alter our candidate products or platform technologies and repeat clinical studies before we identify a potentially successful candidate. We may need to acquire, whether through purchase, license or otherwise, technologies owned by third parties, and we may not be able to acquire such technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Product development is expensive, may take years to complete and can\nhave uncertain outcomes. Failure can occur at any stage of the development. If, after development, a candidate product or service appears successful, we may, depending on the nature of the product or service, still need to obtain FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals before we can market it. The FDA\u2019s clearance or approval pathways are likely to involve significant time, as well as additional research, development and clinical study expenditures. There can be no guarantee that the FDA would clear or approve any future product or service we may develop. Even if the FDA clears or approves a new product or service we develop, we would need to commit substantial resources to commercialize, sell and market it before it could be profitable, and the product or service may never be commercially viable. Additionally, development of any product or service may be disrupted or made less viable by the development of competing products or services.\nIf we determine that any of our current or future development programs is unlikely to succeed, we may abandon it without any return on our investment into the program. We may need to raise significant additional capital to bring any new products or services to market, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur dependence on distributors for sales outside of the U.S. could limit or prevent us from selling our tests in foreign markets and impact our revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have entered into exclusive distribution agreements for the sale of our Oncotype DX tests with distributors covering more than 90 countries. We may enter into other similar arrangements to distribute our tests in other countries in the future. We intend to continue to grow our business internationally, and to do so we may need to attract additional distributors to expand the territories in which we sell our tests. Despite contractual obligations, distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our tests to the level of our expectations. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to enter into or maintain arrangements with distributors to market our tests in particular geographic areas, we may not realize long-term international revenue growth. Additionally, local laws may make it very difficult or costly for us to terminate or replace distributors. Furthermore, our revenue from distributors could be negatively impacted as a result of changes in business cycles, business or economic conditions, coverage determinations, reimbursement rates, changes in foreign currency exchange rates that make our tests more expensive in our distributors\u2019 local currencies or other factors that could affect their ability to pay us for tests on a timely basis or at all.\nWe have entered into a Promotion Agreement with Pfizer regarding the commercialization of Cologuard. If we or Pfizer fail to adequately perform under the Promotion Agreement, or if the Promotion Agreement is terminated prior to its full term, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn August 2018, we entered into a Promotion Agreement (\u201cPromotion Agreement\u201d) with Pfizer, Inc. (\u201cPfizer\u201d), pursuant to which Pfizer will promote Cologuard and provide certain sales, marketing, analytical and other commercial operations support services. We and Pfizer committed in the Promotion Agreement to invest specified amounts in the advertising and promotion of Cologuard. We agreed to pay Pfizer a service fee based on incremental gross profits over specified baselines and pay Pfizer royalties for Cologuard-related revenues for a specified period after the expiration or termination of the Promotion Agreement.\nThe initial term of the Promotion Agreement is scheduled to run through December 31, 2021, but may be terminated by either party at any time on or after February 21, 2020 upon six months\u2019 written notice to the other party.\nWe have dedicated significant time and resources to negotiating, implementing and coordinating performance under the Promotion Agreement. The growth in Cologuard revenue we anticipate as a result of the Promotion Agreement may not occur. We may not realize the expected benefits from the Promotion Agreement for a number of reasons including, among others, if we and Pfizer fail to coordinate our promotional efforts effectively, if Pfizer fails to optimally or effectively promote, market and sell Cologuard or otherwise fails to perform under the Promotion Agreement, if Pfizer prioritizes the promotion of its own, or other partners\u2019, products or services over Cologuard, if the Promotion Agreement is terminated before its anticipated benefits can be fully realized, or if other factors, extraneous to the Promotion Agreement, adversely impact sales of Cologuard (for example, reimbursement, competition, or seasonal factors). We have limited experience executing under co-promotion agreements and Pfizer has limited experience promoting molecular diagnostic products. Our strategic partnership with Pfizer will impact the retention and development of our own sales and marketing capabilities, both for Cologuard and other products in our pipeline. If we do not realize the expected benefits from the Promotion Agreement, either because Pfizer\u2019s marketing strategy and sales and marketing expertise do not translate well to the promotion of Cologuard or for any other reason, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur research and development efforts will be hindered if we are not able to obtain samples, contract with third parties for access to samples or complete timely enrollment in future clinical trials.\nAccess to human sample types, such as blood, tissue, stool, or urine is necessary for our research and product development. Acquiring samples from individuals with clinical diagnoses or associated clinical outcomes through purchase or clinical studies is necessary. Lack of available samples can delay development timelines and increase costs of development. Generally, the agreements under which we gain access to human samples are non-exclusive. Other companies may compete with us for access. Additionally, the process of negotiating access to samples can be lengthy and it may involve numerous parties and approval levels to resolve complex issues such as usage rights, institutional review board approval, privacy rights, publication rights, intellectual property ownership and research parameters. If we are not able to negotiate access to clinical samples with research institutions, hospitals, clinical partners, pharmaceutical companies, or companies developing therapeutics on a timely basis, or at all, or if other laboratories or our competitors secure access to these samples before us, our ability to research, develop and commercialize future products will be limited or delayed. Finally, we may not be able to conduct or complete clinical trials on a timely basis if we are not able to enroll sufficient numbers of patients in such trials, and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our research and development and product commercialization efforts.\nRisks Relating to our Intellectual Property\nWe rely on strategic collaborative and licensing arrangements with third parties to develop critical intellectual property. We may not be able to successfully establish and maintain such intellectual property.\nThe development and commercialization of our products and services rely, directly or indirectly, upon strategic collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. We have collaborative and licensing arrangements with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, under which Mayo provides us with product development and research and development assistance. Certain of Mayo's obligations to provide development assistance expired in January 2020. We and Mayo are in discussions to amend our license agreement to extend that date. In addition, we have licensing agreements with Hologic, Biocartis, Epic Sciences and others. Such arrangements provide us with intellectual property and other business rights crucial to our product development and commercialization. We have incorporated licensed technology into our Cologuard test. Our dependence on licensing, collaboration and other similar agreements with third parties may subject us to a number of risks. There can be no assurance that any current contractual arrangements between us and third parties or between our strategic partners and other third parties will be continued on materially similar terms and will not be breached or terminated early. Any failure to obtain or retain the rights to necessary technologies on acceptable commercial terms could require us to re-configure our products and services, which could negatively impact their commercial sale or increase the associated costs, either of which could materially harm our business and adversely affect our future revenues and ability to achieve sustained profitability.\nWe expect to continue and expand our reliance on collaborative and licensing arrangements. Establishing new strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements is difficult and time-consuming. Discussions with potential collaborators or licensors may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. To the extent we agree to work exclusively with one collaborator in a given area, our opportunities to collaborate with other entities could be limited. Potential collaborators or licensors may reject collaborations with us based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or other factors. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful commercialization of any product or service. In addition, the success of the projects that require collaboration with third parties will be dependent on the continued success of such collaborators. There is no guarantee that our collaborators will continue to be successful and, as a result, we may expend considerable time and resources developing products or services that will not ultimately be commercialized.\nWe may be subject to substantial costs and liability, or be prevented from using technologies incorporated in our screening or diagnostic tests, as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent or other intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our licensors, our licensees, our suppliers, our strategic partners or us. We pursue a patent strategy that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the non-invasive early detection of cancer and pre-cancer, as well as in the guidance of cancer treatment decisions, and is designed to maximize our patent protection against third parties. We have filed patent applications that we believe cover the methods we have designed and use in our Cologuard test to detect colorectal cancer and pre-cancer, our Oncotype DX tests to provide prognosis and guide treatment decisions, and for pipeline cancer tests still in development. In order to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may have to initiate actions against third parties. Any actions regarding patents could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our\nbusiness. Additionally, such actions could result in challenges to the validity, enforceability, or applicability of our patents. Because the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office maintains patent applications in secrecy until a patent application publishes or the patent is issued, we have no way of knowing if others may have filed patent applications covering technologies used by us or our partners. Additionally, there may be third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our technologies that may block or compete with our technologies. From time to time we have received correspondence from third parties alleging to hold intellectual property rights that could block our development or commercialization of products. While none of these inquiries to date have had any material effect on us, we may receive inquiries in the future that could have a material effect on our business. Even if third-party claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit may result in substantial expense to us and may divert the attention of management and key personnel. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we would prevail in any such suits to the extent necessary to conduct our business according to our strategic plan or that the damages or other remedies, if any, awarded against us would not be substantial. Claims of intellectual property infringement may require that we, or our strategic partners, enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may only be available on unacceptable terms, if at all. These claims may also result in injunctions against the further development and commercial sale of services or products containing our technologies, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, patents and patent applications owned by us may become the subject of interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost to us as well as a possible adverse decision as to the priority of invention of the patent or patent application involved. An adverse decision in an interference proceeding may result in the loss of rights under a patent or patent application subject to such a proceeding.\nIf we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property effectively, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property, which would impair any competitive advantage we may otherwise have.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies and other intellectual property rights, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property, which may not be entirely successful, if at all. Additionally, certain of our patents began to expire in 2018. This loss of intellectual property protection may permit third parties to use certain intellectual property assets previously exclusively reserved for our use.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents, and we cannot predict how long it will take for any such patents to be issued. Further, we cannot assure you that other parties will not challenge any patents issued to us or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid or enforceable. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, the subject of opposition proceedings relating to our patents. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in co-ownership of such patents with the third party or the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents. Furthermore, in the life sciences field, courts frequently render opinions that may affect the patentability of certain inventions or discoveries, including opinions that may affect the patentability of isolated DNA and/or methods for analyzing or comparing DNA. Such decisions may adversely impact our ability to obtain new patents and facilitate third-party challenges to our existing patents.\nEven where we have valid patents, third parties may be able to successfully design their products and services around those patents, such that their products and services do not infringe our patents. We may face competition internationally in jurisdictions where we do not have intellectual property protection. Our business may be adversely affected to the extent third parties are able to develop or commercialize competing products and services that do not infringe our patents. We may also be adversely affected to the extent third parties develop or commercialize competing products or services in countries where we did not apply for patents, where our patents have not issued or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized.\nWe depend on trademarks to establish a market identity for our company and our products and services. To maintain the value of our trademarks, we may have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks. We also may not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications, and might have to defend our registered trademarks and pending applications from challenges by third parties. Enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and, if we are unsuccessful, might result in damages, including the inability to continue using certain trademarks.\nIf patent regulations or standards are modified, such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may change the standards of patentability and validity of patents within the cancer screening and diagnostics space, and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nThere have been several cases involving \u201cgene patents\u201d and diagnostic claims that have been considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. In March 2012, the Supreme Court in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc, found a patented diagnostic method claim unpatentable because the relationship between a metabolite concentration and optimized dosage was a patent-ineligible \u201claw of nature.\u201d In June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in ACLU v. Myriad Genetics, Inc, that an isolated genomic DNA sequence is not patent eligible while cDNA is eligible. The Prometheus and Myriad decisions, as well as subsequent case law, affect the legal concept of subject matter eligibility by seemingly narrowing the scope of the statute defining patentable inventions.\nIn December 2014 and again in 2019, the USPTO published revised guidelines for patent examiners to apply when examining process claims for patent eligibility in view of several recent Supreme Court decisions, including Mayo, Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., and Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International, and others. The guidance indicates that claims directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea that do not meet the eligibility requirements should be rejected as non-statutory, patent ineligible subject matter. While these guidelines may be subject to review and modification by the USPTO over time, we cannot assure you that our patent portfolio will not be negatively impacted by the decisions described above, rulings in other cases or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.\nAdditional substantive changes to patent law, whether new or associated with the America Invents Act - which substantially revised the U.S. patent system - may affect our ability to obtain, enforce or defend our patents. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact these substantive changes will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWhile we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, we are required to furnish in our Form 10-K a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective, the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions. Moreover, as described further in Item 9A - Controls and Procedures, in accordance with SEC staff guidance, we have excluded the business of Genomic Health, Inc. we acquired in November 2019 from the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and it is therefore possible we will later determine that corrective action is needed to ensure the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for this acquired business. Establishing, testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff, may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe face risks associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a result of our international operations, we receive a portion of our revenues and pay a portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, such as the Euro, the Swiss franc, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. As a result, we are at risk from exchange rate fluctuations between such foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, the volume of our international orders may be negatively impacted by a strong U.S. dollar. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, approximately 3.9% of our revenues came from foreign denominated currencies. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenues and operating expenses. We may not be able to offset adverse foreign currency impact with increased revenues. We enter into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of adverse movements in foreign exchange rates related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities and hedge our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Even with this strategy in place to mitigate balance sheet foreign currency risk, we will not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results.\nDelaware law, our charter and bylaw documents and certain provisions of our convertible notes could impede or discourage a takeover or change of control that stockholders may consider favorable.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 percent or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Accordingly, our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of our company. In addition, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022Our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.\n\u2022Only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board.\n\u2022Our stockholders may not act by written consent.\n\u2022There are various limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders and advance notice requirements for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\n\u2022Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock.\nThese types of provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the convertible notes we issued in 2018 and 2019 could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d as such term is defined in the indenture for the notes, holders of the convertible notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their convertible notes or any portion of the principal amount of such convertible notes in integral multiples of $1,000. We may also be required to increase the conversion rate in the event of a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change,\u201d as such term is defined in the indenture for the notes. In addition, the indenture and the convertible notes will prohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the convertible notes and the indenture. These and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us.\nOur bylaws provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur bylaws provide, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any claims, including any derivative actions or proceedings brought on our behalf, (1) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director or officer or stockholder in such capacity or (2) that may be brought in the Court of Chancery pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our bylaws described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $1,548.4 million, $672.7 million, and $18.1 million, respectively. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change in equity ownership by value over a specified time period (generally three years). Given the Code\u2019s broad definition, an ownership change could be the unintended consequence of otherwise normal market trading in our stock that is outside our control. An ownership change under Section 382 of the Code could also be triggered by certain strategic transactions. Additionally, tax law limitations may result in our NOLs expiring before we have the ability to use them. Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) of 2017, federal NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite carryover period and may only be used to offset 80 percent of current year taxable income. For these reasons, even if we attain profitability, our ability to utilize our NOLs may be limited, potentially significantly so.\nOur stock price has fluctuated widely and is likely to continue to be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock varied between a high of $123.99 and a low of $60.95 in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including those listed in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d section and other, unknown factors. Among numerous other factors, our stock price also may be affected by:\n\u2022comments by securities analysts regarding our business or prospects;\n\u2022our quarterly operating performance;\n\u2022our issuance of common stock or other securities;\n\u2022our inability to accurately forecast future performance;\n\u2022our inability to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022our entering into merger, acquisition or other similar transactions;\n\u2022general fluctuations in the stock market or in the stock prices of companies in the life sciences or healthcare diagnostics industries; and\n\u2022general conditions and publicity regarding the life sciences or healthcare diagnostics industries.\nConsequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Further, sharp drops in the market price of our common stock, such as we experienced at certain times in our history, may expose us to securities class-action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial expenses and diversion of management\u2019s attention and corporate resources, which would seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not intend to do so.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to use any cash proceeds from our operations to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay cash dividends. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nOur balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 67% of our total assets at December 31, 2019. These assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill. In addition, we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.\nOur management has broad discretion over the use of our available cash and marketable securities and might not spend available cash and marketable securities in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nFrom time to time we may carry high levels of cash and marketable securities. As of September 30, 2019, we had $1.2 billion in combined cash and marketable securities. After completing the combination with Genomic Health, our combined cash and marketable securities fell to $324 million as of December 31, 2019. Our management currently expects to deploy our cash and marketable securities primarily to expand our Cologuard and Oncotype DX operations and commercialization activities, to fund our product development efforts and for general corporate purposes, including working capital and possible acquisitions. However, our management has broad discretion to pursue other objectives, we may raise additional capital, and we may use our current and future resources for other purposes. Our management might not effectively deploy our cash and marketable securities which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under such indebtedness.\nPursuant to the convertible note offerings we completed in 2018 and 2019, we incurred $1.2 billion of indebtedness, and we have a construction loan outstanding of $25.0 million as of December 31, 2019. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations;\n\u2022making it more difficult to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital than we have; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the convertible notes.\nOur ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the convertible notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the convertible notes and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the convertible notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the convertible notes, and such a default could cause us to be in default on any other currently existing or future outstanding indebtedness.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the convertible notes.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our 1.0% and 0.375% convertible senior notes due 2025 and 2027, respectively, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt, including the convertible notes, and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.", "PERMNO": 88863, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "EXAS"}
