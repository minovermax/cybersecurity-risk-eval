Risk Factors.\nSUMMARY RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. In addition to the summary below, carefully review the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report. We may be subject to additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and in our other public disclosures. Some of the principal risks relating to our business include:\n\u2022We incurred significant indebtedness as a result of the Anthony's acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition;\n\u2022We used a significant portion of the Company\u2019s cash for paydown of debt and transaction costs as a result of the Anthony's acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition;\n\u2022The Anthony's acquisition is expected to continue to significantly change the business and operations of BurgerFi. We may face challenges integrating the businesses;\n\u2022The combination of the BurgerFi and Anthony's businesses may not lead to the growth and success of the combined business that we believe will occur;\n\u2022Integrating the businesses of BurgerFi and Anthony's may disrupt or have a negative impact on the combined business;\n\u2022The market price of our Common Stock after the Anthony's acquisition may be affected by factors different from those that affected the shares of BurgerFi prior to the Anthony's acquisition;\n\u2022Our growth strategy for opening new restaurants is highly dependent on the availability of suitable locations and our ability to develop and open new restaurants on a timely basis, on attractive terms;\n\u2022Our expansion into new markets may present increased risks, which could affect our profitability;\n\u2022Our failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business and operating results;\n\u2022New restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable and may negatively affect restaurant sales at our existing restaurants;\n\u2022We have a limited number of suppliers for our major products and rely on a limited number of suppliers for the majority of our domestic distribution needs;\n\u2022Our plans to acquire new brands, and the ongoing need for capital expenditures at our existing restaurants, require us to spend capital;\n\u2022Our marketing strategies and channels will evolve and may not be successful;\n\u2022Our franchise business model presents a number of risks, including launching of the new Anthony's franchise brand. We rely on a limited number of franchisees for the operation of our franchised restaurants, and we have limited control with respect to the operations of our franchised restaurants, which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business;\n\u2022Incidents involving food safety and food-borne illnesses could adversely affect guests\u2019 perception of our brand, result in lower sales and increase operating costs;\n\u2022Increased food commodity and energy costs could decrease our restaurant-level operating profit margins or cause us to limit or otherwise modify our menu, which could adversely affect our business;\n\u2022The digital and delivery business, and expansion thereof, is uncertain and subject to risk;\n\u2022We face significant competition for guests, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be adversely affected;\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, condition and outlook;\n\u2022Security breaches of either confidential guest information in connection with, among other things, our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions or mobile ordering app, or confidential employee information may adversely affect our business;\n\u2022If we experience a material failure or interruption in our systems, our business could be adversely impacted;\n\u2022We depend on key members of our executive management team;\n\u2022We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business;\n\u2022Our insurance coverage may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims;\n\u2022Failure to comply with privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could cause us to face litigation and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations;\n\u2022If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial information or comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price;\n\u2022We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in 2020. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business, investor confidence and our stock price;\n\u2022We have significant stockholders whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders;\n\u2022Our anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of the Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders;\n\u2022We may be unable to maintain the listing of our securities in the future;\n\u2022If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline;\n\u2022A significant number of shares of our common stock are subject to issuance upon exercise of the outstanding warrants, which upon such exercise may result in dilution to our security holders;\n\u2022Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline; and\n\u2022Trading volatility and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors, including its designation as a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nRISK FACTORS\nStockholders should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing and could adversely affect the trading price of our securities. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITIONS, GROWTH STRATEGIES AND OPERATIONS\nThe Anthony's acquisition is expected to continue to significantly change the business and operations of BurgerFi. We may face challenges integrating the businesses.\nAs a result of the Anthony's acquisition, both the size and geographic scope of BurgerFi\u2019s business has significantly increased. We have faced, and may continue to face, challenges integrating such geographically diverse businesses and implementing a smooth transition of business focus and governance in a timely or efficient manner. In particular, if the effort we devote to the integration of our businesses with that of Anthony's diverts more management time or other resources from carrying out our operations than we originally planned, our ability to maintain and increase revenues as well as manage our costs could be impaired. Furthermore, our capacity to expand other parts of our existing businesses may be impaired. We also cannot assure that the combination of the BurgerFi and Anthony's businesses will function as we anticipate, or that significant synergies will result. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe combination of the BurgerFi and Anthony's businesses may not lead to the growth and success of the combined business that we believe will occur.\nWe may not realize all of the synergies that we anticipated from the combination of the BurgerFi and Anthony's businesses and may not be successful in implementing our commercialization strategy. Our combined business is subject to all of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the pursuit of growth in our industry, and we may not be able to successfully sell our products or realize the anticipated benefits from our distribution, collaboration and other commercial partners. If we are not able to grow the combined business of BurgerFi and Anthony's as a commercial enterprise, our financial condition will be negatively impacted.\nIntegrating the businesses of BurgerFi and Anthony's may disrupt or have a negative impact on the combined business.\nWe could have difficulty integrating the assets, personnel, operations and business of BurgerFi and Anthony's. Risks that could impact us negatively include:\n\u2022the difficulty of integrating Anthony's and its concepts and operations;\n\u2022the difficulty in combining our financial operations and reporting;\n\u2022the potential disruption of the ongoing business and distraction of our management, including impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u2022changes in our business focus and/or management;\n\u2022risks related to international operations;\n\u2022the potential that our investment may significantly decrease in value, which may lead to an impairment of the goodwill carrying value of the acquired business; and\n\u2022the potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees.\nOur growth strategy includes pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of additional brands, and we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or successfully operate or integrate any brands that we may acquire.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to opportunistically acquire new brands and restaurant concepts. Competition for acquisition candidates may exist or increase in the future. Consequently, there may be fewer acquisition opportunities available to us as well as higher acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, manage or successfully integrate additional brands or restaurant concepts without substantial costs, delays or operational or financial problems.\nOur successful positioning of our brands depends in large part on the success of our advertising and promotional efforts and our ability to continue to provide products that are desirable by our customers. Accordingly, we intend to continue to pursue an aggressive brand enhancement strategy, which includes multimedia advertising, promotional programs and public relations activities. These initiatives may require significant expenditures. If our multi-brand strategy is unsuccessful, these expenses may never be recovered. Any failure of our other marketing efforts could also have an adverse impact on us.\nThe difficulties of integration include coordinating and consolidating geographically separated systems and facilities, integrating the management and personnel of the acquired brands, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, implementing our management information systems and financial accounting and reporting systems, establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and implementing operational procedures and disciplines to control costs and increase profitability.\nIn the event we are able to acquire additional brands or restaurant concepts, the integration and operation of such acquisitions may place significant demands on our management, which could adversely affect our ability to manage our existing restaurants. In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nAn increase in food and labor costs could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur profitability and operating margins are dependent in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and labor costs, which have been increasing, and may continue to increase, significantly, which may have a negative effect on the operations and profitability of the Company. Changes in the cost or availability of certain food products could affect our ability to offer a broad menu and maintain competitive prices and could materially adversely affect our profitability and reputation. The type, variety, quality and cost of produce, beef, poultry, cheese and other commodities can be subject to change and to factors beyond our control, including weather, climate change, governmental regulation, availability and seasonality, each of which may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply. Although we attempt to mitigate the impact of these cost increases as they occur through increases in selling prices, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so without causing decreases in demand for our products from our customers.\nWe have significant outstanding indebtedness, which requires that we generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy the payment and other obligations under the terms of our debt and exposes us to the risk of default and lender remedies.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the principal balance of the indebtedness under our secured credit agreement, dated as of December 15, 2021 (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), and entered into by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries on November 3, 2021, was $70.3. We may incur additional indebtedness for various purposes, including to fund future acquisitions and operational needs. The terms of our outstanding indebtedness provide for significant principal and interest payments, and subjects us to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including debt service leverage, coverage, and liquidity ratios, each as defined in the Credit Agreement. If certain covenants are not met, the indebtedness may become partially or fully due and payable on an accelerated schedule.\nThe obligations are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that limit the Company\u2019s and such subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, make acquisitions or investments, dispose of certain assets, make dividends and distributions, enter into burdensome agreements, use the proceeds of the loans in contravention to the Credit Agreement, change the nature of their businesses, make fundamental changes, make prepayments on subordinated debt, change their fiscal year, change their organizational documents and make payments of management fees, in each case subject to certain thresholds and exceptions.\nOur ability to meet the payment obligations under our debt depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. We cannot assure that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that other capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under our Credit Agreement and to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service these obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell unencumbered assets (if any) or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these options, we may not be able to meet these payment obligations, and the imposition of lender remedies could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur growth strategy for opening new restaurants is highly dependent on the availability of suitable locations and our ability to develop and open new restaurants on a timely basis, on attractive terms.\nOne of the keys to achieving our growth strategies will be opening and operating new restaurants on a profitable basis for the foreseeable future. We must identify target markets where we can enter or expand, taking into account numerous factors such as the location of our current restaurants, the target consumer base, population density, demographics, traffic patterns, competition, geography and information gathered from our various contacts. We may not be able to open our planned new restaurants within budget or on a timely basis, if at all, given the uncertainty of these factors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we operate more restaurants, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our restaurant base will eventually decline.\nThe number and timing of new restaurants opened during any given period may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including: (1) the identification and availability of attractive sites for new restaurants; (2) difficulty negotiating suitable lease terms; (3) shortages of construction labor or materials; (4) recruitment and training of qualified personnel in the local market; (5) our ability to obtain all required governmental permits, including zoning approvals; (6) our ability to control construction and development costs of new restaurants; (7) competition in new markets, including competition for appropriate sites; (8) the proximity of potential sites to an existing restaurant, and the impact of cannibalization on future growth; (9) anticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new restaurants; and (10) the cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening costs.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully expand as we may not correctly analyze the suitability of a location or anticipate all of the challenges imposed by expanding our operations. Our growth strategy, and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new domestic corporate-owned restaurant, may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits. In addition, as has happened when other restaurant concepts have tried to expand, we may find that our concept has limited appeal in new markets, or we may experience a decline in the popularity of our concept in the markets in which we operate. If we are unable to expand in existing markets or penetrate new markets, our ability to increase our revenue and profitability may be materially harmed or we may face losses.\nOur expansion into new markets may present increased risks, which could affect our profitability.\nWe may open corporate-owned restaurants in markets where we have little or no operating experience. Restaurants we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected restaurant sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy, or operating costs than restaurants we open in existing markets. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than originally planned in advertising and promotional activity in new markets to build brand awareness.\nWe may also incur higher costs from entering new markets if, for example, we assign area directors to manage comparatively fewer restaurants than we assign in more developed markets. Also, until we attain a critical mass in a market, the restaurants we open will incur higher food distribution costs and reduced operating leverage. As a result, these new restaurants may be less successful or may achieve target restaurant-level operating profit margins at a slower rate, if ever.\nOur failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business and operating results.\nOur existing personnel, management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may not be adequate to support our planned expansion. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures, and controls and to locate, hire, train and retain management and operating personnel, particularly in new markets. We may not be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that our planned expansion will impose on management and on our existing infrastructure or be able to hire or retain the necessary management and operating personnel, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. These demands could cause us to operate our existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause a deterioration in the financial performance of our existing restaurants, which could lead to, among other negative financial and operational effects, an impairment of our assets. If we experience a decline in financial performance, we may decrease the number of or discontinue restaurant openings, or we may decide to close restaurants that we are unable to operate in a profitable manner.\nNew restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable and may negatively affect restaurant sales at our existing restaurants.\nOur results have been, and in the future may continue to be, significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings (often dictated by factors outside of our control). Our experience has been that labor and operating costs associated with a newly opened restaurant for the first several months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time, both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales. Our new restaurants take a period of time to reach target operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants, including the training of new personnel, new market learning curves, inability to hire sufficient qualified staff, lack of brand awareness in new markets, and other factors. We may incur additional costs in new markets, particularly for transportation and distribution, which may impact the profitability of those restaurants. New restaurants may not meet our targets for operating and financial metrics or may take longer than anticipated to do so. Any new restaurants we open may not be profitable or achieve operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain and grow restaurant sales at existing restaurants, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nThe level of same-store sales growth, which represents the change in year-over-year revenue for domestic corporate-owned restaurants open for 14 full months or longer, could affect our restaurant sales growth. Our ability to increase same-store sales depends, in part, on our ability to successfully implement our initiatives to build restaurant sales. It is possible such initiatives will not be successful, that we will not achieve our target same-store sales growth or that same-store sales growth could be negative, which may cause a decrease in restaurant sales and profit growth that would adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, including an impairment of our assets.\nOur mission of being \u201cnatural and proud of it\u201d may subject us to risks.\nOur mission is a significant part of our business strategy and what we are as a company. However, we face many challenges in carrying out our mission. We incur higher costs and other risks associated with purchasing high quality ingredients grown or raised with an emphasis on quality and responsible practices. As a result, our food and labor costs may be significantly higher than other companies who do not source high quality ingredients or pay above minimum wage. Additionally, the supply for high quality ingredients may be limited and it may take us longer to identify and secure relationships with suppliers that are able to meet our quality standards and have sufficient quantities to support our growing business. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply for our ingredients on a cost-effective basis, our food costs could increase or we may experience supply interruptions which could have an adverse effect on our operating margins. Additionally, some of our competitors recently announced initiatives to offer better quality ingredients, such as antibiotic-free meat. If this trend continues, it could further limit our supply for certain ingredients and we may lose our competitive advantage because it will be more difficult for our business to differentiate itself.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers for our major products and rely on a limited number of suppliers for the majority of our domestic distribution needs.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers for our major ingredients. Due to this concentration of suppliers, the cancellation of our supply arrangements with any one of these suppliers or the disruption, delay or inability of these suppliers to deliver these major products to our restaurants may materially and adversely affect our results of operations while we establish alternate distribution channels. In addition, if our suppliers fail to comply with food safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted. We cannot assure that we would be able to find replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms or a timely basis, if at all.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to identify or negotiate with alternative supply and distribution sources on terms that are commercially reasonable to us. If our suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts or we are unable to identify alternative sources, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur plans to acquire new brands and open new restaurants, and the ongoing need for capital expenditures at our existing restaurants, require us to spend capital.\nOur growth strategy depends on acquiring new brands and opening new restaurants, which will require us to use cash flows from operations. We cannot assure that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to allow us to implement our growth strategy. If these funds are not allocated efficiently among our various projects, or if any of these initiatives prove to be unsuccessful, we may experience reduced profitability and we could be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned restaurant openings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as our restaurants mature, our business will require capital expenditures for the maintenance, renovation, and improvement of existing restaurants to remain competitive and maintain the value of our brand standard. This creates an ongoing need for cash, and, to the extent we cannot fund capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, funds will need to be borrowed or otherwise obtained. If the costs of funding new restaurants or renovations or enhancements to existing restaurants exceed budgeted amounts, and/or the time for building or renovation is longer than anticipated, our profits and liquidity could be reduced. If we cannot access the capital we need, we may not be able to execute our growth strategy, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.\nOur marketing strategies and channels will evolve and may not be successful.\nWe incur costs and expend other resources in our marketing efforts to attract and retain guests. Our strategy includes public relations, digital and social media, promotions and in-store messaging, which require less marketing spend as compared to traditional marketing programs. As the number of restaurants increases, and as we expand into new markets, we expect to increase our investment in advertising and consider additional promotional activities. Accordingly, in the future, we will incur greater marketing expenditures, resulting in greater financial risk and a greater impact on our financial results.\nWe rely heavily on social media for many of our marketing efforts. If consumer sentiment towards social media changes or a new medium of communication becomes more mainstream, we may be required to fundamentally change our current marketing strategies which could require us to incur significantly more costs. Some of our marketing initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenue. Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which enable them to spend significantly more on marketing and advertising than we can at this time. Should our competitors increase spending on marketing and advertising or our marketing funds decrease for any reason, or should our advertising and promotions be less effective than those of our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of franchisees for the operation of our franchised restaurants, and we have limited control with respect to the operations of our franchised restaurants, which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nWe rely, in part, on our franchisees and the manner in which they operate their restaurants to develop and promote our business. As of December 31, 2021, 51 franchisees operated all of our domestic BurgerFi franchised restaurants, and 1 franchisee operated our international BurgerFi franchised restaurant. We intend to launch the Anthony\u2019s franchise brand in 2022. Our franchisees are required to operate their restaurants according to the specific guidelines we set forth, which are essential to maintaining brand integrity and reputation, all laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries and all laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We provide training to these franchisees to integrate them into our operating strategy and culture. However, since we do not have day-to-day control over all of these restaurants, we cannot give assurance that there will not be differences in product and service quality, operations, labor law enforcement or marketing or that there will be adherence to all of our guidelines and applicable laws at these restaurants. In addition, if our franchisees fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their restaurants, guest preference for the brand could suffer. Failure of these restaurants to operate effectively could adversely affect our cash flows from those operations or have a negative impact on our reputation or our business.\nThe success of our franchised operations depends on our ability to establish and maintain good relationships with our franchisees. The value of our brands and the rapport that we maintain with our franchisees are important factors for potential franchisees considering doing business with us. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with franchisees, we may be unable to renew franchise agreements and opportunities for developing new relationships with additional franchisees may be adversely affected. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be certain that the developers and franchisees we select will have the business acumen necessary to open and operate successful franchised restaurants in their franchising areas.\nFranchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open the restaurants contemplated by their agreements with us or to be able to find suitable sites on which to develop them, or they may elect to cease development for other reasons. Franchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the sites, obtain the necessary permits and governmental approvals or meet construction schedules. Additionally, financing from banks and other financial institutions may not always be available to franchisees to construct and open new restaurants. Any of these factors could slow our growth from franchised operations and reduce our franchising revenue.\nOur franchise business model presents a number of risks, including launching of the new Anthony\u2019s franchise brand.\nOur success as a franchised business relies, in part, on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees. Moreover, as we focus more of our business on growing the franchises, including the planned launch of the Anthony\u2019s franchise, we may not be successful in growing the brand. Our restaurant margins arise from two primary sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., royalties based on a percentage of sales) and sales from corporate-owned restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenue we realize from franchised restaurants is largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales.\nBusiness risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. In particular, our franchisees have also been, and may continue to be, significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages, and inflation. If franchisee sales trends worsen, our financial results will continue to be negatively affected, which may be material. Additionally, a rise in minimum wages could adversely impact our and our franchisees\u2019 financial performance. The impact of events such as boycotts or protests, labor strikes, and supply chain interruptions (including due to lack of supply or price increases) could also adversely affect both us and our franchisees.\nOur success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement our initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the Company or by banks\u2019 lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially-reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we have guaranteed certain franchisee\u2019s lease obligations, which could require us to make lease payments on behalf of franchisees should they fail to honor such commitments. Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brands and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brands' image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.\nOur ownership mix, which we continually evaluate for potential changes to determine our preferred allocation of franchise to corporate-owned stores, also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors, including whether we have effectively selected franchisees that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible or long-lived assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlong with other intangible assets, we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. We also evaluate long-lived assets on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, management performed impairment testing, and the Company recorded impairment at the BurgerFi reporting unit for its goodwill, license agreements, and long-lived assets for approximately $106.5 million, $7.7 million, and $0.6 million, respectively.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any further impairment of assets. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible or long-lived assets become further impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATING IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY\nIncidents involving food safety and food-borne illnesses could adversely affect guests\u2019 perception of our brands, resulting in lower sales and increase operating costs.\nWe face food safety risks, including the risk of food-borne illness and food contamination, which are common both in the restaurant industry and the food supply chain and cannot be completely eliminated. We rely on third-party food suppliers and distributors to properly handle, store and transport ingredients to our restaurants. Any failure by our suppliers, or their suppliers, could cause ingredients to be contaminated, which may be difficult to detect before the food is served. Additionally, the risk of food-borne illness may also increase whenever our food is served outside of our control, such as by third-party delivery services.\nRegardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues, whether or not accurate, at one or more of our restaurants, including restaurants operated by our franchisees, could adversely affect our brands and reputation, which in turn could result in reduced guest traffic and lower sales. If any of our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be liable for certain damages or forced to temporarily close one or more restaurants or choose to close as a preventative measure if we suspect there was a pathogen in our restaurants. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not at our restaurants, could subject us or our suppliers to voluntary or involuntary food recalls and the costs to conduct such recalls could be significant and could interrupt supply to unaffected restaurants or increase the cost of ingredients.\nIncreased food commodity and energy costs, as well as shortages or interruptions, could decrease our restaurant-level operating profit margins or cause us to limit or otherwise modify our menu, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur profitability depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including, among other things: beef, poultry, grains, dairy and produce. Prices have been, and may continue to be, affected due to market changes, increased competition, the general risk of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply due to weather, climate change, international military conflicts, trade sanctions, economic embargoes or boycotts, disease or other conditions beyond our control, or other reasons. Our business and margins have been negatively affected by, and we expect it to be continued to be negatively affected by, among other items, inflation, supply chain difficulties, labor shortages and other price increases.\nThis and other events could increase commodity prices, cause shortages that could affect the cost and quality of the items we buy or require us to further raise prices or limit our menu options. These events, combined with other more general economic and demographic conditions, could impact our pricing and negatively affect our restaurant sales and restaurant-level operating profit margins. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of core operating resources as a result of gradually increased menu prices, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale in the future.\nFrom time to time, competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility. There can be no assurance that future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our guests without any resulting change to their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will generate same-store sales growth in an amount sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by problems in production or distribution, inclement weather, unanticipated demand or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would adversely affect our operating results. For instance, our burgers depend on the availability of our proprietary ground beef blend. If there is an interruption of operation at our national grinder\u2019s facility, we face an immediate risk because each restaurant typically has less than three days of beef patty inventory on hand. Any such material disruption would adversely affect our business.\nLabor shortages or difficulty finding qualified employees could slow our growth, harm our business and reduce our profitability.\nRestaurant operations are highly service oriented, and our success depends in part upon the Company\u2019s and our franchisees\u2019 ability to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees, including restaurant managers and other crew members. The market for qualified employees in our industry is very competitive. Any future inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants and could adversely impact our existing restaurants, both corporate-owned and franchised. Any such delays, material increases in employee turnover rate in existing restaurants or widespread employee dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our and our franchisees\u2019 business and results of operations. In addition, strikes, work slowdowns or other job actions may become more common in the United States. Although none of the employees employed by us or our franchisees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, in the event of a strike, work slowdown or other labor unrest, the ability to adequately staff our restaurants could be impaired, which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims, and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities.\nThe digital and delivery business, and expansion thereof, is uncertain and subject to risk.\nDigital innovation and growth remain a focus for us. Our continuous investment in a sophisticated technology infrastructure, we believe, has enabled us to strategically anticipate and execute against significant industry-wide changes. We utilize advanced technology to analyze, communicate and tactically execute in virtually all aspects of the business. We have executed upon our digital strategy over the past few years, including the development and launch of our app, licensing agreements regarding ghost or cloud kitchens and using various third-party delivery partners, including partnerships with Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates and Grubhub. As the digital space around us continues to evolve, our technology needs to evolve concurrently to stay competitive with the industry. If we do not maintain digital systems that are competitive with the industry, our digital business may be adversely affected and could damage our sales. We rely on third parties for our ordering and payment platforms relating to our mobile app and ghost kitchens. Such services performed by these third parties could be damaged or interrupted by technological issues, which could then result in a loss of sales for a period of time. Information processed by these third parties could also be impacted by cyber-attacks, which could not only negatively impact our sales, but also harm our brand image.\nRecognizing the rise in delivery services offered throughout the restaurant industry, we understand the importance of providing such services to guests wherever and whenever they want. We have invested in marketing to promote our delivery partnerships, which could negatively impact profitability if the business does not continue to expand. We rely on third parties, including Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates and Grubhub, to fulfill delivery orders timely and in a fashion that will satisfy guests. Errors in providing adequate delivery services may result in guest dissatisfaction, which could also result in loss of guest retention, loss in sales and damage to our brand image. Additionally, as with any third-party handling food, such delivery services increase the risk of food tampering while in transit. We are also subject to risk if there is a shortage of delivery drivers, which could result in a failure to meet guests\u2019 expectations. Third-party delivery services within the restaurant industry are a competitive environment and include a number of players competing for market share. If our third-party delivery partners fail to effectively compete with other third-party delivery providers in the sector, delivery business may suffer, resulting in a loss of sales. If any third-party delivery provider we partner with experiences damage to their brand image, we may also see ramifications due to our association with them.\nAdditionally, some of our competitors have greater financial resources to spend on marketing and advertising around their digital and delivery campaigns than we have. Should our competitors increase their spend in these areas, or if our advertising and promotions are less effective than our competitors, there could be an adverse impact on our business in this space. As delivery, as well as the associations we have made in connection with delivery, is still a new concept, it is difficult for us to anticipate its impact to our sales as well as the challenges we may face in the future.\nWe face significant competition for guests, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive with many well-established companies that compete directly and indirectly with us with respect to taste, price, food quality, service, value, design and location. We compete in the restaurant industry with multi-unit national, regional and locally owned and/or operated limited-service restaurants and full-service restaurants. We compete with (1) restaurants, (2) other fast casual restaurants, (3) quick service restaurants and (4) casual dining restaurants. We may also compete with companies outside of the traditional restaurant industry, such as grocery store chains, meal subscription services and delicatessens, especially those that target customers who seek high-quality food, as well as convenience food stores, cafeterias and other dining outlets.\nMany of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence, better locations and greater name recognition nationally or in some of the local markets in which we operate or plan to open restaurants. Some of our competitors may also have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. They may also operate more restaurants than we do and may be able to take advantage of greater economies of scale than we can given our current size.\nOur competition continues to intensify as new competitors enter the burger and premium pizza, fast-casual, quick service and casual dining segments. Many of our competitors emphasize low cost \u201cvalue meal\u201d menu options or other programs that provide price discounts on their menu offerings, a strategy we do not currently pursue. We also face increasing competitive pressures from some of our competitors with initiatives to offer better quality ingredients, such as antibiotic-free meat. Our continued success depends, in part, on the continued popularity of our menu and the experience we offer guests at our restaurants. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, customer traffic, restaurant sales and restaurant-level operating profit margins could decline, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing property subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.\nWe do not own any real property, and all of our domestic corporate-owned restaurants are located on leased premises. The leases for our restaurants generally have initial terms ranging from ten to twenty years and typically provide for two to four five-year renewal options as well as rent escalations. Generally, our leases are net leases that require us to pay our share of the costs of real estate taxes, utilities, building operating expenses, insurance and other charges in addition to rent. We generally cannot cancel these leases. Additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases.\nIf we close a restaurant, we may still be obligated to perform our monetary obligations under the applicable lease, including, among other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially-acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations. We depend on cash flows from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings or other sources, we may not be able to service our lease obligations or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would materially affect our business.\nRestaurant companies have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings that are costly, divert management attention and, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial damages or settlement costs.\nOur business is subject to the risk of, and we are party to, including a shareholder class action lawsuit, litigation by employees, guests, suppliers, franchisees, stockholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify.\nIn recent years, restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination, and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, overtime eligibility of assistant managers and failure to pay for all hours worked.\nAdditionally, our guests could file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to one of our restaurants, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illnesses or accidents in our restaurants. We are also subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of our business, including contract claims.\nThe restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce guest traffic and restaurant sales. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts with respect to these or other matters.\nA judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to risks related to its sale of alcoholic beverages.\nWe serve beer and wine at most of our restaurants. Alcoholic beverage control regulations generally require our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license that must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our restaurants, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.\nAny future failure to comply with these regulations and obtain or retain licenses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also subject in certain states to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person.\nWe carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance. Litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments and settlements under dram shop statutes. Because these cases often seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, such litigation could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and resources away from operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, condition, and outlook.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic conditions in the United States, where most of our restaurants are located. The Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, impacts from COVID-19, as federal, state and local governments may continue to react to the public health crisis by encouraging or requiring social distancing, instituting stay-at-home orders and requiring, in varying degrees, restaurant dine-in limitations, capacity limitations or other restrictions. It is possible that further outbreaks could limit a steady recovery seen by the Company because of consumer behavior to off-premises dining and promotional activities associated with delivery. The Company continues to monitor the spread of new variants. Despite a recent decline in cases, hospitalizations and deaths in large portions of the United States, mask mandates, social-distancing, travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders could be reinstated in locations where we are located. Although the pandemic has presented challenges, it has also caused us to undertake and accelerate certain growth initiatives, such as new digital capabilities. By positioning ourselves to expand access, safety, and convenience of our customers, we believe that we are positioned to return to growth. An extended period of economic disruption, however, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and overall financial condition.\nSecurity breaches of either confidential guest information in connection with, among other things, our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions or mobile ordering app, or confidential employee information may adversely affect our business.\nOur business requires the collection, transmission and retention of large volumes of guest and employee data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information technology systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services. The integrity and protection of that guest and employee data is critical to us. The techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. Our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, shutdowns or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct, employee error or malfeasance, utility failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Due to these scenarios, we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\nAdditionally, the information, security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental regulation are increasingly demanding. Our systems may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements or may require significant additional investments or time to do so. Efforts to hack or breach security measures, failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data all threaten our and our service providers\u2019 information systems and records. A breach in the security of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits. Additionally, a significant theft, loss or misappropriation of, or access to, guests\u2019 or other proprietary data or other breach of our information technology systems could result in fines, legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, which could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to claims from guests and employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we experience a material failure or interruption in our systems, our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, expanding our systems as we grow or a breach in security of these systems could result in interruptions to or delays in our business and guest service and reduce efficiency in our operations. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, our revenue and profits could be reduced, and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments. Additionally, as we continue to evolve our digital platforms and enhance our internal systems, we place increasing reliance on third parties to provide infrastructure and other support services. We may be adversely affected if any of our third-party service providers experience any interruptions in their systems, which then could potentially impact the services we receive from them and cause a material failure or interruption in our own systems.\nWe depend on key members of our executive management team.\nWe depend on the leadership and experience of key members of our executive management team. The loss of the services of any of our executive management team members could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace such personnel on a timely basis or without incurring increased costs, or at all. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers. We believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. There is a high level of competition for experienced, successful personnel in our industry. Our inability to meet our executive staffing requirements in the future could impair our growth and harm our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks, proprietary products and other intellectual property, including our name and logos and the unique character and atmosphere of our restaurants. We rely on United States and foreign trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as franchise agreements, non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Nevertheless, our competitors may develop similar menu items and concepts, and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and other intellectual property. We may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and service marks, and our competitors and others may successfully challenge the validity and/or enforceability of our trademarks and service marks and other intellectual property.\nAdditionally, we may be prohibited from entering into certain new markets due to restrictions surrounding competitors\u2019 trademarks. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and in foreign countries may not be adequate. We may also from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights.\nOur insurance coverage may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, and property damage. We believe that we maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nREGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS\nWe are subject to many federal, state and local laws, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, with which compliance is both costly and complex. Failure to comply with, or changes in these laws or requirements, could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, including those related to: (1) nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements; (2) food safety regulations; (3) local licensure, building and zoning regulations; (4) employment regulations; (5) the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the \u201cPPACA\u201d); (6) the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) and similar state laws; (7) privacy and cybersecurity; and (8) laws and regulations related to our franchised operations. The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, uncertainty around future changes in laws made by new regulatory administrations or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and, therefore, have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. In addition, certain laws, including the ADA, could require us to expend significant funds to make modifications to our restaurants if we fail to comply with applicable standards. Compliance with all of these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations relating to our franchised operations could negatively affect our licensing sales and our relationships with our franchisees.\nOur franchised operations are subject to laws enacted by a number of states, rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and certain rules and requirements regulating licensing activities in foreign countries. Failure to comply with new or existing franchising laws, rules and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could negatively affect our licensing sales and our relationships with our franchisees.\nNutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements may change consumer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.\nIn recent years, there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus on the food industry, including nutritional and advertising practices. These changes have resulted in, and may continue to result in, the enactment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu offerings, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food offerings. For example, a number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information to customers or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants.\nFurthermore, the PPACA establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to post certain nutritional information on their menus. Specifically, the PPACA amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to require certain chain restaurants to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. These new labeling laws may also change consumer buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales. Additionally, an unfavorable report on, or reaction to, our menu ingredients, the size of our portions or the nutritional content of our menu items could negatively influence the demand for our offerings.\nFailure to comply with local licensure, building and zoning regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe development and operation of restaurants depend, to a significant extent, on the selection of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic, liquor laws, and other regulations and requirements. We also are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety, and fire standards. Typically, licenses, permits and approvals under such laws and regulations must be renewed annually and may be revoked, suspended, or denied renewal for cause at any time if governmental authorities determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations. Difficulties or failure to maintain or obtain the required licenses, permits and approvals could adversely affect our existing restaurants and delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants, which would adversely affect our business.\nFailure to comply with privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could cause us to face litigation and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur business requires the collection, transmission and retention of large volumes of guest and employee data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information technology systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services. The collection and use of such information are regulated at the federal and state levels. Regulatory requirements, both domestic and abroad, have been changing and increasing regulation relating to the privacy, security, and protection of data. Such regulatory requirements may become more prevalent in other states and jurisdictions as well. It is our responsibility to ensure that we are complying with these laws by taking the appropriate measures as well as monitoring our practices as these laws continue to evolve.\nAs our environment continues to evolve in this digital age and reliance upon new technologies, for example, cloud computing and its digital methods of ordering, become more prevalent, it is imperative we secure the private and sensitive information we collect. Failure to do so, whether through fault of our own information systems or those of outsourced third-party providers, could not only cause us to fail to comply with these laws and regulations, but also could cause us to face litigation and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our brand\u2019s reputation and our image as an employer could also be harmed by these types of security breaches or regulatory violations.\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes by the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities, and our tax liabilities will be affected by the allocation of expenses to differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: (1) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; (2) expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowance; (3) tax effects of stock-based compensation; and (4) changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof. We may also be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAn \u201cownership change\u201d could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nWe have certain general business credit tax credits (\u201cTax Attributes\u201d). Our ability to use these Tax Attributes to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as discussed below. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"IRC\" or \"Internal Revenue Code\"), and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, we may carry forward or otherwise utilize the Tax Attributes in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the Tax Attributes do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will have available a significant amount of Tax Attributes in future years, and therefore the Tax Attributes could be a substantial asset to us. However, if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the IRC, our ability to use the Tax Attributes may be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Attributes could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset\nIn general, an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 occurs if the percentage of stock owned by an entity\u2019s 5% stockholders (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the entity immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize the Tax Attributes arising from an ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC would depend on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d it is possible that a significant portion of our tax loss and credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial information or comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and the listing standards of Nasdaq. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. It also requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure of any material weaknesses in such controls. As an emerging growth company, if we become a large accelerated filer or when we are no longer an emerging growth company and become an accelerated filer, we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we anticipate that we will expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of management evaluations and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting that we may become required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which may have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control in the future this may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of future financial statements, and our reputation, business, and the price of our common stock, as well as may lead to a loss of investor confidence in us.\nAs disclosed under Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, management concluded that there was a material weakness in internal control in relation to the accounting for income taxes as of December 31, 2021 and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nThe material weakness for the year ended December 31, 2021 was identified through management's assessment of internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2021. Although management did not conduct a formal assessment of internal control over financial reporting in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, management identified a number of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as follows:\n\u2022lack of controls over the financial closing and reporting process relating to a sufficient segregation of duties in the preparation of our financial statements and related notes, and, for the Successor period, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation and warrant liabilities;\n\u2022lack of resources to perform and review the application of accounting standards for revenue, leases, and variable interest entities (\"VIEs\");\n\u2022specifically with respect to VIEs, our internal control over financial reporting failed to detect errors related to consolidating variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary;\n\u2022lack of effective controls over the accounting for deferred rent and accounting for initial franchise fees and brand development revenue in connection with the adoption of our new revenue recognition standard; and\n\u2022lack of controls during the Successor period related to the valuation of contingent consideration issued in the BurgerFi acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the remediation measures related to prior year material weaknesses. However, we concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2021 as a result of the material weakness that was identified in relation to accounting for income taxes. Completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements and have other consequences that may materially and adversely affect our business, including an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, potential actions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, possible defaults under our credit agreement, shareholder lawsuits, a loss of investor confidence, and damage to our reputation.\nWe have significant stockholders whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 52.4% of the voting power of our common stock was held, directly or indirectly, by our current board of directors, executive officers and greater than 5% beneficial owners. In addition, we are party to the Director Voting Agreement, which we entered into on December 16, 2020, with our sponsor, LH Equities, LLC (the \u201cSponsor\u201d), certain of the initial stockholders (the \u201cInitial Stockholders\u201d) who held founders\u2019 shares (the \u201cFounders\u2019 Shares\u201d) prior to the initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) of Opes, the Members and our then-serving officers and directors (the \u201cVoting Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, all such stockholders agree to vote their shares of the Company in favor of the current members of the Board of Directors, comprised of Ophir Sternberg, Allison Greenfield, Vivian Lopez-Blanco, Gregory Mann and Martha Stewart, or, if any of them ceases to serve as a director, such other person designated by our Executive Chairman, in consultation with John Rosatti. In addition, in connection with the Anthony's acquisition, on November 3, 2021, we entered into an additional Voting Agreement with Cardboard, Ophir Sternberg and Lionheart Equities, LLC (\"Lionheart Equities\"), pursuant to which all such stockholders agreed to vote their shares of the Company in favor of Ophir Sternberg, Allison Greenfield, Vivian Lopez-Blanco, Gregory Mann, Martha Stewart and Andrew Taub (or any successor director designee of Cardboard) for a period of one year from the date of the closing of the Anthony's acquisition (the \"Anthony's Closing\").\nCertain of these stockholders, for the foreseeable future, have influence over corporate management and affairs, as well as matters requiring stockholder approval, and they will be able to, subject to applicable law and the Voting Agreement, participate in the election of the members of our board of directors, including amendments to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. Our board of directors will have the authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness and applicable rules and regulations, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions.\nIt is possible that the interests of these stockholders may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. This could influence their decisions, including with regard to whether and when to dispose of assets and whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, the determination of future tax reporting positions, the structuring of future transactions and the handling of any future challenges by any taxing authorities to our tax reporting positions may take into consideration these stockholders\u2019 tax or other considerations, which may differ from our considerations or those of our other stockholders.\nOur anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of the Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include: (1) the authority to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt; (2) our classified board of directors, which provides that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time; (3) prohibitions regarding the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors; (4) limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or amend our Amended and Restated Bylaws; (5) requirements that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and (6) advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. In addition, Delaware law, to which the Company is subject, prohibits it, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who owns at least 15% of its common stock.\nThe provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation includes an exclusive venue provision. This provision requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our Company, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of Delaware General Corporation Law or our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws, or (5) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware.\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees and may result in increased costs to a stockholder who has to bring a claim in a forum that is not convenient to the stockholder, which may discourage such lawsuits. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d we are permitted to provide less disclosure than larger public companies, which may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, which may result in less investor confidence. Investors may find our common stock less attractive as a result of our smaller reporting company status. If some investors find our common stock less attractive, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d) permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we would be permitted, and we intend to, omit the auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as described above. We also intend to take advantage of the exemption provided under the JOBS Act from the requirements to submit say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute votes to our stockholders, and we will avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that we can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of these benefits until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as indexed for inflation), (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of securities by OPES at its initial public offering on March 16, 2018, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d as defined under the Exchange Act.\nUntil such time that we lose \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status, it is unclear if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities, and our stock prices may be more volatile and could cause our stock prices to decline.\nWe may be unable to maintain the listing of our securities in the future.\nIf we fail to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (1) a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; (2) reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; (3) a determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if they are not already determined to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d at the time of such failure to meet such requirements, which will require brokers trading in our securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; (4) a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for us; and (5) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STOCK\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on the Company. Research coverage from industry analysts may be limited. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, our stock price and trading volume could be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nA significant number of shares of our common stock are subject to issuance upon exercise of the outstanding warrants, which upon such exercise may result in dilution to our security holders.\nOutstanding warrants (including (A) warrants to purchase shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, issued in connection with the IPO (the \u201cPublic Warrants\u201d) and (B)(i) warrants to purchase shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, which consist of warrants that are part of the units issued to Lion Point Capital, L.P. (\"Lion Point\") and Lionheart Equities, under the Amended and Restated Forward Purchase Contracts that the Company entered into, at the time of the BurgerFi acquisition, with Lion Point and Lionheart Equities, (ii) private placement warrants and (iii) working capital warrants, all of which were issued pursuant to private placement exemptions (together with (i) and (ii), the \u201cPrivate Warrants\u201d)) and warrants exercisable for shares underlying units outstanding pursuant to the unit purchase option to purchase units of the Company issued to EarlyBirdCapital and its designees in connection with the IPO (the \u201cUnit Purchase Option\u201d) to purchase shares of our common stock are exercisable at a price of $11.50 per share. Refer to Note 13 Stockholders' Equity as it relates to the number of warrants and options outstanding as of year end. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our existing holders of common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s shares of common stock are currently deemed a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per common share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per common share, subject to certain exceptions. The Company\u2019s securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000, exclusive of their principal residence, or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade its securities. The Company believes that the penny stock rules may discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of its common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our shares of common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nTrading volatility and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.\nMany factors are expected to affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to its operating results and prospects. Some of these factors, several of which are outside our control, are the following:\n\u2022the unpredictable nature of economic and market conditions;\n\u2022governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, and media reports and commentary about economic, trade or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;\n\u2022trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); and\n\u2022investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Series A Junior Preferred Stock.\nIn the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designation (the \u201cCertificate of Designation\u201d) filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware by BurgerFi prior to the Anthony's Closing designating shares of our Preferred Stock as Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cSeries A Junior Preferred Stock\u201d), the holders of Series A Junior Preferred Stock are entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders before any payment is made to the holders of our common stock.\nThe rights of our holders of common stock to participate in the distribution of our assets rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors, the Series A Junior Preferred Stock and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks senior to our common stock. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, in one or more series on terms determined by our board of directors. As a result of the Anthony's acquisition, shares of Series A Junior Preferred Stock were issued.\nThe issuance of Series A Junior Preferred Stock in connection with the Anthony's acquisition and any other future offerings of debt or senior equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If we decide to issue debt or senior equity securities in the future, it is possible that these securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. The Series A Junior Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Common Stock and may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time and must be redeemed by the Company in limited circumstances.\nAdditionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the Series A Junior Preferred Stock or common stock and may result in dilution to holders of the Series A Junior Preferred Stock or common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we do not know the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, holders of the Series A Junior Preferred Stock and common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our capital securities and diluting the value of their holdings in us.\nThe Series A Junior Preferred Stock is entitled to both preference dividends and participating dividends and no dividends, may be declared or paid on our common stock until (i) such preference dividends and participating dividends have been paid in full or (ii) all such dividends have been declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of them has been set aside for the benefit of the holders of the Series A Junior Preferred Stock.\nThe terms of the Series A Junior Preferred Stock place significant limitations on our ability to pay dividends on shares of our common stock, and payments made on the Series A Junior Preferred Stock are expected to significantly reduce or eliminate any cash that we might otherwise have available for the payment of dividends on shares of common stock. In particular, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock until (i) any accrued and unpaid preference dividends and participating dividends (as described below) with respect to the Series A Junior Preferred Stock have been paid in full or (ii) all such dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of them has been or is set aside for the benefit of the holders of the Series A Junior Preferred Stock.\nIn addition, holders of Series A Junior Preferred Stock are entitled to participate in dividends paid to holders of our common stock to the same extent as if such holders of Series A Junior Preferred Stock had shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. As a result, the success of an investment in the common stock may depend entirely upon any future appreciation in the value of the common stock. There is no guarantee that the common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain its initial value.", "PERMNO": 17369, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "OPES"}
