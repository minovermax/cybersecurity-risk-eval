RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks in our business operations as described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are the known risk factors we consider material. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Investors should carefully consider these risks before making an investment decision.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters.\nWe write insurance policies that cover homeowners for losses that result from, among other things, catastrophes and sinkholes. Catastrophic losses can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, wind, hail, fires, explosions and other events. The incidence and severity of these events are inherently unpredictable. Catastrophic losses can also be caused by terrorist attacks, war, riots, political instability and other man-made events. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of two factors: the total amount of the insurance company\u2019s exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Our homeowners policyholders are disbursed throughout the southeast United States, although the majority of our policyholders are located in Florida. Further, a substantial portion of our Florida homeowners policyholders, are located in southeastern Florida, and therefore are especially subject to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms.\nThe occurrence of claims from catastrophic events can result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or years as seen in 2019, 2018 and 2017. An elevation in the values and concentrations of insured property may increase the severity of the occurrence of claims in the future. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls and the purchase of third-party reinsurance, catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations. As a result, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nFlorida, South Carolina and Texas, all states in which we write homeowners policies, experienced several significant hurricanes in 2019, 2018 and 2017, which some weather analysts believe is consistent with a period of greater hurricane activity. Exposure risk management alternatives are carefully evaluated as they may increase operating expenses and may not be successful in protecting long-term profitability. If our loss experience is more adverse than is contemplated by our loss reserves, the related increase in our loss reserves may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs.\nOur loss reserves are estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual liability for losses, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nWe maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liabilities for losses and LAE. These reserves are estimates based on historical data and statistical projections of what we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known to us. Actual loss and LAE reserves, however, may vary significantly from our estimates. Factors that affect loss and LAE reserves include the estimates made on a claim-by-claim basis known as \u201ccase reserves\u201d coupled with bulk estimates known as IBNR. Periodic estimates by management of the ultimate costs required to settle all claim files are based on our analysis of historical data and estimations of the impact of numerous factors such as:\n\u2022per-claim information;\n\u2022company and industry historical loss experience, including the impact of trends such as the AOB by insureds;\n\u2022legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in the awarding of damages, and changes in political attitudes; and\n\u2022trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation.\nManagement revises its estimates based on the results of its analysis. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for estimating the ultimate settlement of all claims. There is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of the reserves, because the eventual redundancy or deficiency is affected by multiple factors. Because of the uncertainties that surround estimated loss reserves, we cannot be certain that our reserves will be adequate to cover our actual losses. If our loss and LAE reserves are less than actual losses and LAE, we will be required to increase our reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Future loss experience, substantially in excess of our loss and LAE reserves, could substantially harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our risks, our costs of obtaining reinsurance fluctuates and we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements.\nWe have a reinsurance structure that is a combination of private reinsurance and the FHCF. Our reinsurance structure is composed of several reinsurance companies with varying levels of participation providing coverage for losses and LAE at pre-established minimum and maximum amounts. Losses incurred in connection with a catastrophic event below the minimum and above the maximum are the responsibility of FNIC, MIC and MNIC.\nThe availability and costs associated with the acquisition of reinsurance varies year to year. We are not able to control these fluctuations which may be significant and may limit our ability to purchase adequate coverage. The recovery of increased reinsurance costs through rate increases is not immediate and cannot be presumed, as rate increases are subject to approval of the Florida OIR or LDI. We may be unable to purchase reinsurance for the liabilities we reinsure, and if we successfully purchase such reinsurance, we may be unable to collect, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of non-collectability of reinsurance, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs is common practice within the insurance industry, we transfer a portion of the risks insured under our policies to other companies through the purchase of reinsurance. This reinsurance is maintained to protect our insurance subsidiary against the severity of losses on individual claims, unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss and other catastrophic events. Although reinsurance does not discharge our insurance subsidiary from its primary obligation to pay for losses insured under the policies it issues, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiary for the reinsured portion of the risk. A credit exposure exists with respect to ceded losses to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts. The collectability of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reinsurance structure has significant risks, including the fact that the FHCF or our other reinsurers may not have available capital resources to pay their claims or that their ability to pay their claims in a timely manner may be impaired. This could result in significant financial, legal and operational challenges to our company. Therefore, in the event of a catastrophic loss, we may become dependent upon the FHCF\u2019s and our other reinsurers\u2019 ability to pay their claims. With respect to the FHCF, we may, in turn, be dependent upon the ability of the State Board of Administration of Florida (\u201cSBA\u201d) to issue bonds in amounts that would be required to meet its reinsurance obligations in the event of such a catastrophic loss.\nWe may experience increased financial exposure from climate change.\nA body of scientific evidence indicates that climate change is occurring. Climate change, to the extent that it affects weather patterns, is likely to cause an increase in the frequency and/or the severity of catastrophic events or severe weather conditions. Our financial exposure from climate change is most notably associated with losses in connection with the occurrence of hurricanes striking Florida, Louisiana and Texas. We mitigate the risk of financial exposure from climate change by restrictive underwriting criteria, sensitivity to geographic concentrations, and reinsurance.\nRestrictive underwriting criteria can include, but are not limited to, higher premiums and deductibles and more specifically excluded policy risks such as fences and screened-in enclosures. New technological advances in computer generated geographical mapping afford us an enhanced perspective as to geographic concentrations of policyholders and proximity to flood prone areas. Our amount of maximum reinsurance coverage is determined by subjecting our homeowners exposures to statistical forecasting models that are designed to quantify a catastrophic event in terms of the frequency of a storm occurring once in every \u201cn\u201d years. If the statistical forecasting models fail to contemplate an emerging claim trend, such as the assignment of insurance benefits in Florida, then there is the risk we may not purchase adequate catastrophic wind coverage. Our reinsurance coverage contemplates the effects of a catastrophic event that occurs only once every 130 years. Our amount of losses retained (our deductible) in connection with a catastrophic event is determined by market capacity, pricing conditions and surplus preservation. There can be no assurance that our reinsurance coverage and other measures taken will be sufficient to mitigate losses resulting from one or more catastrophic events.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by contagious terminally severe health viruses.\nWe are exposed to the risk of natural or man-made events, such as a pandemic or other health related events that could cause a large number of deaths, injuries or business disruptions. Significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century, but the likelihood, timing or severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted. A localized or widespread event that directly affects our\nworkplace or customers could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our ability to effectively conduct business, including our ability to write new business, and our financial condition. Also, such events could harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Limiting FedNat\u2019s exposure to the spread of infectious diseases, the Company has long supported a work from home culture in response to business continuity concerns by establishing and supporting the expansion of the Company\u2019s network infrastructure to include dedicated home workstations for most employees.\nWe may face difficulties integrating the Maison Companies, which we acquired in December 2019. Failure to effectively integrate their operations could harm our growth or operating results.\nOn December 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of the Maison Companies from PIH. We face the substantial risks associated with acquisitions of existing businesses. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk that we may not be able to effectively integrate the operations, personnel, services or technologies of the business acquired; the risks associated with determining adequate loss reserves for the business acquired; the potential disruption of our ongoing businesses; the diversion of management attention because of the substantial management time and resources required; the difficulty in developing or maintaining controls and procedures; and the dilution of our existing shareholders resulting from the issuance of shares of our common stock as part of the acquisition consideration.\nCompleting the integration of the Maison Companies may require us to use cash resources and incur contingent liabilities. We may also be faced with material liabilities not disclosed to us as part of our due diligence process. If we are not able to address these liabilities and otherwise successfully integrate the acquired business, we may not receive the intended benefits of this acquisition. As a result, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to grow because our capital must be used to pay greater than anticipated claims, our financial results may suffer.\nOur ability to grow in the future will depend on our ability to expand the types of insurance products we offer and the geographic markets in which we do business, both balanced by the business risks we choose to assume and cede. We believe that our company is sufficiently capitalized to operate our business as it now exists and as we currently plan to expand it. Our existing sources of funds include issuance of debt securities, possible sales of our investment securities, and our earnings from operations and investments. Catastrophic events in our market areas, such as the hurricanes experienced in Florida, South Carolina and Texas in 2019, 2018 and 2017, have resulted and may result in greater claims losses than anticipated, which could require us to limit or halt growth while we redeploy our capital to pay these unanticipated claims.\nThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations.\nVarious provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which have been negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. At the present time, we employ a variety of exclusions to our policies that limit exposure to known risks, including, but not limited to, exclusions relating to certain named liabilities, types of vehicles and specific artisan activities. In addition, the policies we issue contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. While we believe our insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the loss exposure to us and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or that legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect our loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe failure of various risk mitigation strategies utilized could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or reputation in the marketplace.\nWe utilize a number of tactics to mitigate risk exposure within our insurance business, which include:\n\u2022Avoidance to risks that do not conform to underwriting standards;\n\u2022Risk portfolio optimization;\n\u2022Transferring portfolio risk to financially sound reinsurance companies;\n\u2022Acquiring adequate primary insurance to ensure continued operations; and\n\u2022Promoting an enterprise risk management culture.\nIf we fail to mitigate our risk exposure, the Company could experience increased claims, losses from catastrophic events that are not reinsured and a damage of our reputation that makes agents and reinsurers reluctant to work with us.\nTrends in claims and coverage issues have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage emerge. These issues adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued.\nAn example of an existing trend, particularly in Florida homeowners insurance, is the assignment of benefits for a claim where a service provider agrees to make a repair that may be covered by an insurance policy in exchange for the policyholder\u2019s right to sue the insurance carrier directly. The assignment of the insurance benefits has substantially increased, and may continue to increase, our exposure to inflated claims, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Although legislative actions in the State of Florida to limit the effect of AOB on insurance companies are being contemplated, there can be no assurances that any such legislative actions will become law or, if enacted, that such actions will have the effect of limiting the impact on us of assignments of benefits by insureds.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants in our senior note indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indenture for our senior notes requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to comply with various operational and other covenants, including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt without the approval of the existing noteholders. If there were an event of default under the indenture that was not cured or waived, the holders of the senior notes could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the senior notes to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay the senior notes, either upon maturity or, if accelerated, upon an event of default, or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the senior notes. This would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may require additional capital in the future which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. To the extent that our capital may be insufficient to meet future operating requirements and/or cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth. Many factors will affect the amount and timing of our capital needs, including our growth and profitability, our claims experience, and the availability of reinsurance, as well as possible acquisition opportunities, market disruptions and other unforeseeable developments.\nIf we were required to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders\u2019 ownership could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of existing shareholders. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business or pay dividends. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we conduct business. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to shareholders and other investors, and relates to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurance company\u2019s business. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. State regulatory authorities also conduct periodic examinations into insurers\u2019 business practices. These reviews may reveal deficiencies in our insurance operations or differences between our interpretations of regulatory requirements and those of the regulators.\nThe NAIC and state insurance regulators are constantly reexamining existing laws and regulations, generally focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws.\nFrom time to time, some states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. In other situations, states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that impact the competitive environment and marketplace for property and casualty insurance. In addition, in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. Changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in financial services regulation and federal taxation, can significantly impact the insurance industry and us.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the effect any enacted, proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the regulatory requirements applicable to our business will not become more stringent in the future or result in materially higher costs than current requirements. Changes in the regulation of our business may reduce our profitability, limit our growth or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nOur revenues and operating performance will fluctuate due to statutorily approved assessments that support property and casualty insurance pools and associations.\nWe operate in a regulatory environment where certain entities and organizations have the authority to require us to participate in assessments. Currently these entities and organizations include, but are not limited to, the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association (\u201cFIGA\u201d), Citizens, the FHCF, Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (\u201cTWIA\u201d) and Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance (\u201cLCPI\u201d).\nInsurance companies currently pass these assessments on to holders of insurance policies in the form of a policy surcharge, and reflect the collection of these assessments as fully earned credits to operations in the period collected. The collection of these fees, however, may adversely affect our overall marketing strategy due to the competitive landscape in Florida. As a result, the impact of possible future assessments on our balance sheet, results of operations or cash flow are indeterminable at this time.\nOur investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns, or losses, which would significantly reduce our earnings.\nLike other insurance companies, we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a portion of our earnings. During the time that normally elapses between the receipt of insurance premiums and any payment of insurance claims, we invest the premiums received, together with our other available capital, primarily in debt securities and to a lesser extent in equity securities, in order to generate investment income.\nOur investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as bonds, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. A significant increase in interest rates or decrease in credit worthiness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Declines in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income.\nWe are required to review our investment portfolio to evaluate and assess known and inherent risks associated with each investment type. We revise our evaluations and assessments as conditions change and new information becomes available. This may result in changes in an other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) in our consolidated statements of income. We base our assessment of whether an OTTI has occurred on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. Because historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments and additional impairments may need to be recorded in the future, no assurances can be provided that we have accurately assessed whether any such impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary or that we have accurately recorded amounts for an OTTI in our financial statements.\nIn addition, volatile and illiquid markets increase the likelihood that investment securities may not behave in historically predictable manners, resulting in fair value estimates that may be overstated compared with actual amounts that could be realized upon disposition or maturity of the security. The effects of market volatility, declining economic conditions, such as a US or global economic slowdown, whether due to coronavirus, or other factors, could adversely impact the fair value or credit quality of securities in our portfolio and may have unforeseen consequences on the liquidity and financial stability of the issuers of securities we hold. Such deteriorations in financial condition can occur rapidly, leaving us unable to react to such a scenario in a prudent manner consistent with our historical practices in dealing with more orderly markets. This, in turn, could adversely and negatively affect our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nOur failure to pay claims accurately could adversely affect our business, financial results and capital requirements.\nWe must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, the culture of our claims organization and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and\nother factors. Our failure to pay claims accurately could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial results.\nIn addition, if we are not able to handle an increasing number of claims as a result of a catastrophic event, or if we do not train new claims adjusting employees effectively or lose a significant number of experienced claims adjusting employees, our claims department\u2019s ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected. In addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, we could suffer decreased quality of claims work, which in turn could lower our operating margins.\nOur insurance companies are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nOur insurance companies are subject to RBC standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws, including the laws of the State of Florida. The RBC standards, based upon the Risk Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require our insurance companies to report their results of RBC calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. These RBC standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company\u2019s total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its ACL RBC.\nIf we fail to meet the applicable RBC or minimum statutory capital requirements imposed by the laws of Florida or other states where we do business, we would be required to raise additional capital and we could be subject to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on out writing of additional business, additional state supervision, or liquidation. Similarly, an increase in existing RBC requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements, such as the catastrophic risk component of RBC may require us to increase our statutory capital levels.\nRatios calculated based on RBC tend to be a key criteria in the assignment of ratings by insurance rating agencies.\nOur revenues and operating performance may fluctuate with business cycles in the property and casualty insurance industry.\nHistorically, the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical patterns characterized by periods of significant competition in pricing and underwriting terms and conditions, which is known as a \u201csoft\u201d insurance market, followed by periods of lessened competition and increasing premium rates, which is known as a \u201chard\u201d insurance market. Although an individual insurance company\u2019s financial performance is dependent upon its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern, with profitability generally increasing in hard markets and decreasing in soft markets. At present, on a consolidated basis, we continue to file and obtain rate increases as the current Florida property and casualty market continues to harden, but remains competitive. Elsewhere in the United States, we are experiencing a stable market, but increased competition. We cannot predict how long these market conditions will persist. Although we do not compete entirely on price or targeted market share, negative market conditions may impair our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot write insurance at appropriate rates, our revenues and operating performance may be adversely affected.\nNew homeowners insurance operations outside of Florida may not be profitable.\nOur insurance subsidiaries currently conduct business in a limited number of states in addition to Florida, with concentrations of business in South Carolina, Louisiana and Texas and to a lesser extent in Alabama and Mississippi. Any single catastrophic occurrence or other condition affecting losses in these states could adversely affect the results of our operating results. We plan to continue the expansion of admitted homeowners property and casualty programs into other states as opportunities arise. Expanding our operations to additional states present risks similar to those we currently face with our existing operations, including risks associated with the inability to market an adequately priced policy, inadequate commission structures, and overpriced or unavailable catastrophic reinsurance for wind events. Additionally, we would become subject to the insurance regulators in each state and the laws and regulations designed to regulate the insurance products and operations of new and existing insurance companies under their respective authority. As a result, there can be no guarantees that state regulators will allow us to do business in those states or, if we are approved to operate in a state, that our operations will be profitable in that state.\nIf we determine to expand to additional states or to expand the types of insurance products we offer, we may incur additional costs and may not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.\nAlthough we exited the automobile and commercial general liability lines of insurance, we may determine to expand our product offerings in the future by underwriting additional insurance products and programs, and marketing them through our distribution network. Expansion of our product offerings will result in increases in expenses due to additional costs incurred in actuarial rate\njustifications, software and personnel. Offering additional insurance products may also require regulatory approval, further increasing our costs. Before we can write insurance in a new state, or sell a new insurance product in a state, we must obtain a license or other approvals from the applicable state insurance regulators. These state insurance regulators may request additional information, add conditions to the license that we find unacceptable, or deny our application. This would delay or prevent us from operating in that state or offering that new product. There can be no assurance that we would be successful bringing new insurance products to our markets in a manner that is profitable.\nOur success depends on our ability to accurately price the risks we underwrite.\nThe results of operations and the financial condition of our insurance company depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, LAE and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and price our products accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022the availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data;\n\u2022the uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022our selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques;\n\u2022changes in legal standards, claim settlement practices, medical care expenses and restoration costs;\n\u2022regulatory restrictions, including, without limitation regulatory approval of rates sought; and\n\u2022legislatively imposed consumer initiatives.\nConsequently, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our sales volume and competitiveness. In either event, the profitability of our insurance company could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdverse ratings by insurance rating agencies may adversely impact our ability to write new policies, renew desirable policies or obtain adequate reinsurance, which could limit or halt our growth and harm our business.\nThird-party rating agencies assess and rate the ability of insurers to pay their claims. The insurance industry uses financial strength ratings to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. Ratings are based on criteria established by the rating agencies and reflect evaluations of each insurer\u2019s profitability, debt and cash levels, customer base, adequacy and soundness of reinsurance, quality and estimated market value of assets, adequacy of reserves, capital and RBC ratios, and management. Ratings are also based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors, such as purchasers of our common stock.\nOur ability to compete successfully in states outside of Florida to expand our business footprint may also be negatively affected by our lack of an A.M. Best company rating of our financial strength. Although our insurance subsidiaries have a Demotech rating of \u201cA\u201d (Exceptional), which is generally accepted in Florida and certain other states, a rating by A.M. Best is more widely accepted outside of Florida and may cause customers and agents to prefer a policy written by an A.M. Best-rated company over a policy written by us. In addition, some mortgage companies outside of Florida may require homeowners to obtain property insurance from an insurance company with a minimum A.M. Best rating.\nThe withdrawal or downgrade of our ratings could limit or prevent us from writing or renewing desirable insurance policies, from competing with insurers who have higher ratings, from obtaining adequate reinsurance, or from borrowing on a line of credit or cause us to default on financial covenants contained in certain of our debt financing agreements. The withdrawal or downgrade of our ratings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position because our insurance products might no longer be acceptable to the secondary marketplace and mortgage lenders. Furthermore, a withdrawal or downgrade of our ratings could prevent independent agents from selling and servicing our insurance products or could increase the commissions we must pay to these agents.\nWe rely on independent and general agents to write our insurance policies, and if we are not able to attract and retain independent and general agents, our revenues would be negatively affected.\nWe currently market and distribute our products and services through contractual relationships with a network of independent agents and a select number of general agents. Our independent agents are our primary source for our property and liability insurance policies. Many of our competitors also rely on independent agents. As a result, we must compete with other insurers for independent agents\u2019\nbusiness. Our competitors may offer a greater variety of insurance products, lower premiums for insurance coverage, or higher commissions to their agents. If our products, pricing and commissions do not remain competitive, we may find it more difficult to attract business from independent agents to sell our products. A material reduction in the amount of our products that independent agents sell or a material reduction in the number of independent agents with whom we maintain a relationship could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a party to an insurance agency master agreement with ISA, an affiliate of Allstate, pursuant to which we are authorized by ISA to appoint Allstate agents to offer our homeowners insurance products to consumers in Florida. Since that time, our homeowners premiums and the percentage of homeowners premiums attributable to Allstate agents has increased rapidly. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 23.2%, 23.8% and 23.8%, respectively, of the homeowners premiums we underwrote were from Allstate\u2019s network of Florida agents, and this concentration may continue to increase. An interruption or change in our relationship with ISA could have a material adverse effect on the amount of premiums we are able to write, as well as our results of operations.\nWe are a party to a managing general underwriting agreement with SageSure to facilitate growth in our FNIC homeowners business outside of Florida. As a percentage of our total homeowners premiums, 23.1%, 15.0% and 10.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were underwritten by SageSure. The profitability of the business we obtain outside of Florida through this agreement will depend substantially on the quality of underwriting performed by SageSure. An interruption in SageSure\u2019s services for us, or issues with the quality of SageSure\u2019s underwriting, could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the business obtained through this relationship.\nCertain of our agreements with agents provide that the renewal rights for policies written under those agreements belong to the agents, making it more difficult for us to maintain the policies written and the premium income generated through these relationships.\nOur agreements with ISA and SageSure provide that ISA and SageSure, respectively, own the expirations of the policies underwritten under these agreements. This means that we do not have the right to solicit renewals of these policies. As a result, we may be less able to maintain the policies and the corresponding premium income from renewals of policies written by us under these agreements.\nCybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to loss of data or liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our insureds and employees, on our networks. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims against us, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations, and damage our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Although we have implemented security measures to protect our systems from viruses and other intrusions by third parties, there can be no assurances that these measures will be effective. To mitigate these costs, we carry a cyber-liability insurance policy. Our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all financial and other loss. Additionally, this policy will not cover us for security breaches, data loss, or cyber-attacks experienced by our third-party business partners who have access to our customer, agent, or employee data.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving the systems of one or more of our business partners or vendors.\nWe conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of third-party business partners and vendors, who provide software, hosting, communication, and other computer services to us. Our networks could be compromised by the errors or actions of our vendors and other business partners with legitimate access to our systems. If one of our vendors or other business partners are the subject of a security breach or cyber-attack, such breach or attack may result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems, and the loss, theft or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers, agents or employees, notwithstanding our substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. An unauthorized disclosure or loss of policyholder or employee information or other sensitive or confidential information, including by cyber-attack or other security breach, could cause a loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. While we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and the failure of these systems could disrupt our operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our current information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations, as well as to perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development. As a result, the failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nIncreased competition, competitive pressures, industry developments and market conditions could affect the growth of our business and adversely impact our financial results.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from national, regional and residual market insurance companies in the homeowners markets, many of whom are larger, have greater financial and other resources, have higher financial strength ratings and offer more diversified insurance coverage. Our competitors include companies that market their products through agents, as well as companies that sell insurance directly to their customers. Large national captive writers may have certain competitive advantages over independent agency writers, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base and reduced policy acquisition costs. We may be forced to reduce our premiums or increase our commissions significantly to compete, which could make us less profitable and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not meet the prices offered by our competitors, we may lose business in the short term, which could also result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur executive management team is critical to the strategic direction of our company. If there were an unplanned loss of service by any of our officers our business could be harmed.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend, on the services of our executive management team, which includes Michael H. Braun, Chief Executive Officer and President, and others. Our success also will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. If we were to lose the services of one or more members of our executive management team, our business could be adversely affected. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, any unplanned loss of service could substantially harm our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated.\nIf in the future we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. We could also become subject to investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources to address.\nOur reliance on insurance scoring in pricing and underwriting certain of our insurance policies may be limited by changes in applicable law, regulation or policies of regulatory authorities, which could cause our pricing and underwriting to be less effective.\nWe rely on insurance scoring, which combines credit scores and claims history of persons applying for insurance policies with us, in pricing and underwriting these policies. We believe that the use of this information, together with other relevant information provided to us in the application process, is important to our ability to effectively price our insurance products and determine the risks we are willing to underwrite. We also believe that we use this information in accordance with applicable law, regulations and policies. From time to time, however, the use of this information has come under review by insurance and other regulators. If the use of this information is limited or prohibited, our pricing and underwriting of our insurance policies may be less effective, with the result that our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Shares\nOur stock price in recent years has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile. As a result, the market price of our common stock may drop below the price you pay, and you may not be able to resell your shares at a profit.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility from time to time. Such volatility may be affected by various factors and events, such as:\n\u2022our operating results, including a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022recognition of large unanticipated accounting charges, such as related to a loss reserve enhancement;\n\u2022changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally;\n\u2022Failure to successfully integrate the operations of the Maison Companies into those of the Company;\n\u2022Demotech downgrade;\n\u2022the announcement of a material event or anticipated event involving us or our industry or the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022the issuance of a significant number of shares; and\n\u2022the other risk factors described in this Annual Report, the accompanying notes and the documents incorporated by reference herein.\nIn recent years, the U.S. stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have sometimes affected the market price of the securities issued by a particular company in a manner unrelated to the operational performance of the Company. This type of market effect could impact our common stock price as well. The volatility of our common stock means that the price of our common stock may have declined substantially at such time as you may look to sell your shares of our common stock. If our share price decreases, the value of your investment could decline.\nWe have authorized but unissued preferred stock, which could affect rights of holders of common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be issued as a method of discouraging a takeover attempt. Although we do not intend to issue any preferred stock at this time, we may do so in the future.\nAs a holding company, we depend on the earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay management fees and dividends to the holding company as the primary source of our income.\nWe are an insurance holding company whose primary assets are our subsidiaries. Our operations, and our ability to pay dividends or service our debt, are limited by the earnings of our subsidiaries and their payment of their earnings to us in the form of management fees, commissions, dividends, loans, advances or the reimbursement of expenses. These payments can be made only when our subsidiaries have adequate earnings. In addition, dividend payments made to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by Florida law governing the insurance industry. Generally, Florida law limits the dividends payable by insurance companies under complicated formulas based on the subsidiaries\u2019 available capital and earnings.\nPayment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings and financial position and such other factors, as our board of directors deems relevant.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders in the public market, or the possibility or perception of such future sales, or sales of additional shares of common stock by us, could depress our stock price.\nInvestors currently known to be the beneficial owners of more than 5.0% of our common stock hold approximately 45% of our outstanding shares. This includes PIH, which received 1,773,102 shares in the closing of our acquisition of the Maison Companies. The resale of PIH's shares has been registered, but is subject to certain limitations under our standstill agreement with PIH. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise by our existing shareholders, or the possibility or perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. In addition, we may issue additional shares of our common stock from time to time in the future in amounts that may be significant. The sale of substantial amounts of our common stock by us, or the perception that these\nsales may occur, could adversely impact our stock price.
