{"cik": "1167419", "company": "Venaxis, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we fail to obtain FDA clearance for our APPY1 Test, we cannot market the product in the United States.\nTherapeutic or human diagnostic products require FDA clearance (or approval or licensing) prior to marketing and sale. This applies to our ability to market, directly or indirectly, our acute appendicitis test, the APPY1 Test. As a new product, this test must undergo lengthy and rigorous development testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA. In January 2015, we received a \u201cnot substantially equivalent\u201d letter from the FDA with respect to our de novo 510(k) submission. We are in the process of determining how to proceed. One alternative path, which is longer and more restrictive, called a premarket approval, or PMA, would place our product in the FDA\u2019s Class III, and be longer and more difficult to obtain.\nWe may not be able to get the APPY1 Test in its current form cleared by the FDA. There is no assurance that any of our strategies for obtaining FDA clearance or approval will be successful. If we do achieve FDA clearance or approval, it could be limited with respect to the indications for use, or could be subsequently be suspended or revoked, or we could be fined, based on a failure to continue to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements and standards. Similar regulatory approval or ongoing requirements and contingencies will also be encountered in major international markets.\nIf we fail to obtain FDA clearance or approval for our AA products, we will not be able to market and sell our AA products in the United States. As a result, we would not be able to recover the resources spent on research and development of such products. The inability to obtain FDA clearance or approval for our product may also have an impact on our success in commercializing the product in international markets.\nIf we fail to reach an understanding with the FDA regarding clearance for a blood-based appendicitis test, we intend to pursue alternative business opportunities.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be successful in our discussions with the FDA regarding our APPY1 Test or our APPY2 test in development. If we fail to reach an understanding with the FDA regarding clearance for a blood-based appendicitis test, we intend to pursue alternative business or technology opportunities. Such alternative business opportunities could include looking at new products or technologies, or business combination activities. We can provide no assurance that we would be successful in pursuit of any such alternative business or technology opportunities.\nThe successful development of a medical device such as our acute appendicitis test is highly uncertain and requires significant financial expenditures and time.\nSuccessful development of medical devices is highly uncertain. Products that appear promising in research or development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development or the market for several reasons, including failure to obtain regulatory clearance or approval, manufacturing costs, pricing and reimbursement issues, or other factors that may render the product uneconomical to commercialize. In addition, success in clinical trials may not lead to an approvable product. Evolutions in development from early stage products to later state products may require additional testing or analysis. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approvals.\nIf we elect to accelerate our APPY2 product development efforts, or engage in development of new products, the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. If our large-scale clinical trials for a product are not successful, we will not recover our substantial investments in that product.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient sales of our products in the European Union countries or elsewhere outside of the U.S. to be profitable.\nWe obtained CE marking for our APPY1 System products in January 2013. We have launched commercialization and marketing activities in the EU. Our strategy is to leverage the experience of key opinion leaders in select hospitals in order to generate additional meaningful, multinational field data for APPY1 System products and leverage successful data into relationships with distributors in the identified target countries. We may not be able to implement such strategy on a timely basis, and may encounter the uncertainties and delays in adoption that accompany new diagnostic testing alternatives, pricing pressure for our products and difficulties developing the relationships necessary to conduct business outside of the United States.\nClinical trials are expensive and we cannot assure that we will be able to complete our clinical trial data analysis program successfully within any specific time period, or if such clinical trial data analysis takes longer to complete than we project, our ability to execute our current business strategy will be adversely affected.\nConducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we must demonstrate through clinical trials the safety and effectiveness of our products. We have incurred, and we will continue to incur, substantial expense for, and devote a significant amount of time to, product development, pilot trial testing, clinical trials and regulated, compliant manufacturing processes.\nWe face competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and new diagnostic tests, which may be developed by others, could impair our ability to maintain and grow our business and remain competitive.\nWe face competition in the development, manufacture, marketing and commercialization of diagnostic products such as ours from a variety of sources, such as academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including other companies with similar diagnostic or in vitro testing technologies, including those with platform technologies. These platform technologies vary from very large analyzer systems to smaller and less expensive instruments similar to ours. These competitors are working to develop and market other diagnostic tests, systems, products and other methods of detecting, preventing or reducing disease.\nThe development of new technologies or improvements in current technologies for diagnosing acute appendicitis, including less invasive imaging studies and products that would compete with our acute appendicitis test could have a negative impact on our ability to sell the acute appendicitis tests. This could impact our ability to market the tests or secure a marketing partner - both of which could have a substantial impact on the value of our acute appendicitis products.\nAmong the many experimental diagnostics and therapies being developed around the world, there may be diagnostics and therapies unknown to us that may compete with our technologies or products.\nMany of our potential competitors have much greater capital resources, manufacturing, research and development resources and production facilities than we do. Many of them may also have more experience than we have in preclinical testing and clinical trials of new diagnostic tests and in obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approvals.\nMajor technological changes can occur quickly in the biotechnology industry, and the development of technologically improved or different products or technologies may make our product candidates or platform technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nPhysicians, patients, third party payors and the medical community may be slow to adopt, and may not accept or utilize our acute appendicitis test products when and if approved. If our products, if and when approved, do not achieve significant market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have very limited sales and marketing experience with our products and limited sales capabilities, which may make commercializing our products difficult.\nWe currently have very little marketing experience and limited sales capabilities. Therefore, in order to commercialize our products, once approved, we must either develop our own marketing and distribution sales capabilities or consider collaborating with a third party to perform these functions. We may, in some instances, rely significantly on sales, marketing and distribution arrangements with collaborative partners and other third parties. In these instances, our future revenues will be materially dependent upon the success of the efforts of these third parties. We have elected to suspend our U.S.-based commercialization activities as we assess our next steps forward. Such decision could delay the ramp up of our sales and marketing resources if we are able to attain clearance or approval for our products.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to serve in our sales and marketing organization, to develop an effective distribution network or to otherwise effectively support our commercialization activities. The cost of establishing and maintaining a sales and marketing organization may exceed its cost effectiveness. If we fail to develop sales and marketing capabilities, if sales efforts are not effective or if costs of developing sales and marketing capabilities exceed their cost effectiveness, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain medical reimbursement for our products under development, as well as a changing regulatory environment, may impact our business.\nThe U.S. healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our ability to market our acute appendicitis tests due to medical coverage or reimbursement limits. Sales of our human diagnostic tests will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of such tests are covered by health maintenance, managed care, and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health payor administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third party payors. These healthcare payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments. Accordingly, our potential products may not be considered to be cost effective, and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these changes may be adverse to us. Any reduction in Medicare, Medicaid or third party payor reimbursements could have a negative effect on our operating results. The addition of the medical device tax is also a challenge to the industry.\nIf we successfully obtain FDA clearance or approval to market our acute appendicitis test, we (or our vendors) may experience manufacturing problems resulting in shortages or delays in production that could limit the near-term growth of our revenue.\nOur ability to successfully market an acute appendicitis test, once it is approved, will partially depend on our ability to obtain and manufacture sufficient quantities of the finished tests from qualified GMP suppliers. While we have identified and qualified suppliers, their ability to produce tests or component parts in sufficient quantities to meet possible demand may cause delays in securing products or could force us to seek alternative suppliers. The need to locate and use alternative suppliers could also cause delivery delays for a period of time. Delays in finalizing and progressing under agreements with cGMP facilities may delay our FDA clearance process and potentially delay sales of such products. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in production due to, among other things, the inability to obtain sufficient amounts of raw materials, components or finished goods inventory and quality control issues with raw materials, components or finished goods. These difficulties could reduce sales of our products, increase our costs or cause production delays, all of which could damage our reputation and hurt our financial condition. To the extent that we enter into manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on them to perform their obligations in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable government regulations.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated revenue from the out-licensing of our animal health assets.\nIn 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with a third party to license all of our animal health assets in return for license fees, milestone and royalty payments. If product development efforts using our animal health assets are not successful in achieving commercial products, we may not receive all anticipated milestone and royalty payments.\nOur results of operations could be affected by our royalty payments due to third parties.\nAny revenues from products under development will likely be subject to royalty payments under licensing or similar agreements. Major factors affecting these payments include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\ncoverage decisions by governmental and other third party payors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to achieve meaningful sales of our products;\n\u25cf\nthe achievement of milestones established in our license agreements; and\n\u25cf\nour use of the intellectual property licensed in developing the products.\nIf we need to seek additional intellectual property licenses in order to complete our product development, our cumulative royalty obligations could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to successfully develop, obtain clearance or approval for and commercialize new products.\nOur success depends on our ability to successfully develop and market new products. Although we have been engaged in human diagnostic antigen manufacturing operations and historically, and substantially all of our revenues have been derived from this business, our ability to substantially increase our revenues and generate net income is contingent on successfully developing one or more products. Our ability to develop any of products is dependent on a number of factors, including funding availability to complete development efforts, to adequately test and refine products, to seek required FDA clearance or approval and to commercialize our products, thereby generating revenues once development efforts prove successful. We have encountered in the past, and may again encounter in the future, problems in the testing phase for our products, which sometimes resulted in substantial setbacks in the development process. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar setbacks with the products in our pipeline, or that funding from outside sources and our revenues will be sufficient to bring any or all of our products to the point of commercialization. There can be no assurance that the products we are developing will work effectively in the marketplace, or that we will be able to produce them on an economical basis.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions, then we cannot market our products in those jurisdictions.\nWe have begun marketing the APPY1 Test in the EU. We plan to market our human diagnostic products in other foreign jurisdictions. We may need to obtain regulatory approvals from foreign jurisdictions to do so and obtaining such approval in one jurisdiction does not necessarily guarantee approval in another. We may be required to conduct additional testing or to provide additional information, resulting in additional expenses, to obtain necessary approvals. If we fail to obtain approval in such foreign jurisdictions, we would not be able to sell our products in such jurisdictions, thereby, reducing the potential revenue from the sale of our products.\nWe may be unable to retain key employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in our business. A loss of the services of our qualified personnel, as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner would harm our development programs and our business.\nOur product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover claims.\nOur insurance policies currently cover claims and liabilities arising out of defective products for losses up to $3.0 million per incident. As a result, if a claim were to be successfully brought against us, we may not have sufficient insurance that would apply and would have to pay any costs directly, which we may not have the resources to do.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur competitive position is contingent upon the production of our intellectual property and we may not be able to withstand challenges to our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on our intellectual property, including our issued and applied for patents and our licenses, as the foundation of our business. If our intellectual property rights are challenged, no assurances can be given that our patents or licenses will survive claims alleging invalidity or infringement on other patents or licenses. Additionally, disputes may arise regarding inventorship of our intellectual property. There also could be existing patents of which we are unaware that our products may be infringing upon. As the number of participants in the market grows, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases. It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine how such disputes would be resolved. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with patent litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be required to be publicly disclosed. In addition, during the course of patent litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. Any litigation claims against us may cause us to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain upon our financial resources, divert the attention of management or restrict our core business or result in the public disclosure of confidential information. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could materially impact our business.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents and other intellectual property rights, and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology.\nSome or all of our patent applications may not issue as patents, or the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technologies or products. In addition, patents issued to us or our licensors, if any, may be challenged and subsequently narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry and could harm our business. Litigation might be necessary to protect our patent position or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company would have the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and we may not have the required resources to pursue such litigation or to protect our patent rights. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights in these patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party treble damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity in the United Sates, in particular, is difficult because it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference or other proceeding in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the PTO, or a court to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends upon compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent prosecution process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nOur failure to secure trademark registrations could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates and our business.\nOur trademark applications in the United States and any other jurisdiction where we may file, when filed, may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the PTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our applications or registrations, and our applications or registrations may not survive such proceedings. Failure to secure such trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates and our business.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could impede our ability to compete.\nBecause we operate in the highly technical field of biotechnology we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, consultants and corporate partners, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property outside of the United States.\nThe laws in some of those countries may not provide protection for our trade secrets and intellectual property. If our trade secrets or intellectual property are misappropriated in those countries, we may be without adequate remedies to address the issue. Additionally, we also rely on confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements to protect our intellectual property. These agreements provide for contractual remedies in the event of misappropriation. We do not know to what extent, if any, these agreements and any remedies for their breach, will be enforced by a foreign or domestic court. In the event our intellectual property is misappropriated or infringed upon and an adequate remedy is not available, our future prospects will greatly diminish.\nAdditionally, prosecuting and maintaining intellectual property (particularly patent) rights are very costly endeavors. We do not know whether legal and government fees will increase substantially and therefore are unable to predict whether cost may factor into our intellectual property strategy.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nWe require additional capital for future operations and we cannot assure you that capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all, or on terms that would not cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.\nWe have historically needed to raise capital to fund our operating losses including development expenses, which have been significant. We expect to continue to incur operating losses in 2015 and 2016. If capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned, we may require additional capital sooner than expected. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, especially in light of the state of the current financial markets which could impact the timing, terms and other factors in our attempts to raise capital. Any sale of a substantial number of additional shares may cause dilution to our existing shareholders and could also cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nCurrent challenges in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe global financial markets have recently experienced unprecedented levels of volatility. Our ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the Company\u2019s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the Company\u2019s key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions. While these conditions and the current economic downturn have not meaningfully adversely affected our operations to date, continuing volatility in the global financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets. Current or worsening economic conditions may also adversely affect the business of our customers, including their ability to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare in general. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our potential products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, our investors\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, will depend on capital appreciation, if any.\nThe Company does not intend to declare any dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future and currently intends to retain any future earnings for funding growth. As a result, investors should not rely on an investment in our securities if they require the investment to produce dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our shares may be investors\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Moreover, investors may not be able to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid for them.\nOur stock price, like that of many biotechnology companies, is volatile.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology companies, in general, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future, particularly in light of the current financial markets. In addition, the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, especially on the eve of Company announcements which the market is expecting, as is the case with clinical trial results. Among other factors, the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf announcements of clinical trial results, FDA correspondence or interactions, developments with regard to our intellectual property rights, technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf publicity regarding actual or potential medical results related to products under development or being commercialized by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf regulatory developments or delays affecting our products under development in the United States and other countries; and\n\u25cf new proposals to change or reform the U.S. healthcare system, including, but not limited to, new regulations concerning reimbursement programs.\nAs a public company we are subject to complex legal and accounting requirements that require us to incur substantial expenses, and our financial controls and procedures may not be sufficient to ensure timely and reliable reporting of financial information, which, as a public company, could materially harm our stock price and listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAs a public company, we are subject to numerous legal and accounting requirements that do not apply to private companies. The cost of compliance with many of these requirements is substantial, not only in absolute terms but, more importantly, in relation to the overall scope of the operations of a small company. Failure to comply with these requirements can have numerous adverse consequences including, but not limited to, our inability to file required periodic reports on a timely basis, loss of market confidence, delisting of our securities and/or governmental or private actions against us. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these requirements or that the cost of such compliance will not prove to be a substantial competitive disadvantage vis-\u0430-vis our privately held and larger public competitors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Our compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures may in the future be limited by a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfaulty human judgment and simple errors, omissions or mistakes;\n\u00b7\nfraudulent action of an individual or collusion of two or more people;\n\u00b7\ninappropriate management override of procedures; and\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that any enhancements to controls and procedures may still not be adequate to assure timely and accurate financial information.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we may be subject to NASDAQ delisting, investigations by the SEC and civil or criminal sanctions.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Section 404 requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational, financial and accounting systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively.\nAny delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls may cause our operations to suffer, and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. If we are unable to complete the required Section 404 assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, if we fail to maintain or implement adequate controls, our ability to obtain additional financing could be impaired. In addition, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting and in the accuracy of our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act. A lack of investor confidence in the reliability and accuracy of our public reporting could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The trading price of our common stock from time to time has fluctuated widely and may be subject to similar volatility, in the future. For example in the calendar year ended December 31, 2014, our common stock traded as low as $1.58 and as high as $3.29. In the calendar year ended December 31, 2013, our common stock traded as low as $1.20 and as high as $2.74. The trading price of our common stock in the future may be affected by a number of factors, including events described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d In recent years, broad stock market indices, in general, and smaller capitalization companies, in particular, have experienced substantial price fluctuations. In a volatile market, we may experience wide fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain our current listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market and a delisting could limit the liquidity of our stock, increase its volatility and hinder our ability to raise capital.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2014, our common stock has traded as low as $0.40, following the FDA decision announcement. In March 2015, we received notice from NASDAQ that we had failed to maintain a bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 30 successive trading days. We have a minimum of six months to regain compliance with the listing standard, and may be able to obtain an additional six-month compliance period. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the NASDAQ Capital Market listing of our common stock in the future.\nIf our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ, our common stock may be eligible for quotation on an over-the-counter quotation system or on the pink sheets. Upon any such delisting, our common stock would become subject to the regulations of the SEC relating to the market for penny stocks. A penny stock is any equity security not traded on a national securities exchange that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. The regulations applicable to penny stocks may severely affect the market liquidity for our common stock and could limit the ability of shareholders to sell securities in the secondary market. In such a case, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock, and there can be no assurance that our common stock will be eligible for trading or quotation on any alternative exchanges or markets.\nDelisting from NASDAQ could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through public or private sales of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nWe have been named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit with claims of violations of the federal securities laws.\nWe have been named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit with claims of violations of the federal securities laws. See the description in Item 3 below. We believe the alleged claims are without merit, but if we are not successful in our defense of this action we could be liable for significant damages. Even if we are successful, litigation is expensive and defense of the action could have a negative impact on our financial resources.", "PERMNO": 92213, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "RIOT"}
