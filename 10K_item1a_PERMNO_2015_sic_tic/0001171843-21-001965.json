{"cik": "1357459", "company": "Seneca Biopharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. We have described below a number of uncertainties and risks which, in addition to uncertainties and risks presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The uncertainties and risks enumerated below as well as those presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report should be considered carefully when evaluating our company, business and the value of our securities.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe Exchange Ratio is adjustable based on our net cash at closing and LBS\u2019s Pre-Merger Financing, so the consideration at the closing of the Merger may have a greater or lesser value than at the time the Merger Agreement was signed.\nThe relative proportion of the combined company that our stockholders will own when the Merger closes will be based on the valuations of Seneca and LBS as negotiated by the parties and as specified in the Merger Agreement. Assuming a $22.5 million investment in LBS prior to the consummation of the Merger (\u201cPre-Merger Financing\u201d), the outstanding equity of Seneca, as calculated on an adjusted fully diluted treasury stock method basis and after giving effect to such financing, is expected to be held as follows: equity holders of former LBS capital stock (prior to the Pre-Merger Financing) will hold approximately 25.2%; the investor in the Pre-Merger Financing will hold approximately 16.2%; pre-Merger Seneca equity holders will hold approximately 26.2%; and approximately 32.4% of the shares will be held in escrow to be distributed to the investor in the Pre-Merger Financing, or to be distributed to LBS Pre-Merger Financing equity holders. These estimates are based on the anticipated Exchange Ratio and are subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement. Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Exchange Ratio at the closing of the Merger may be subject to either an upward or downward adjustment based on: (i) Seneca\u2019s net cash, or (ii) the proceeds of the Pre-Merger Financing.\nFailure to complete the Merger may result in us paying a termination fee to LBS and could harm our common stock price and our future business and operations.\nIf the Merger is not completed, each of Seneca and LBS is subject to the following risks:\n\u00b7 upon termination of the Merger Agreement, LBS may be required to pay Seneca a termination fee of $1.5 million, under certain circumstances, and/or up to $250,000 in expense reimbursements;\n\u00b7 upon termination of the Merger Agreement, Seneca may be required to pay LBS a termination fee of $1.5 million, under certain circumstances, and/or up to $250,000 in expense reimbursements;\n\u00b7 the parties will have incurred significant expenses related to the Merger, such as legal and accounting fees, which must be paid even if the Merger is not completed; and\n\u00b7 Seneca may be forced to cease its operations, dissolve and liquidate its assets.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that we will be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided in the Merger.\nIf the conditions to the closing of the Merger are not met, the Merger may not occur.\nEven if the change of control and related share issuance are approved by our stockholders, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the Merger. We cannot assure you that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger may not occur or will be delayed, we may lose some or all the intended benefits of the Merger.\nThe Merger may be completed even though material adverse changes may result from the announcement of the Merger, industry-wide changes and/or other causes.\nIn general, either Seneca or LBS can refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between the date of the Merger Agreement, and the closing of the Merger. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on Seneca or LBS, including:\n\u00b7 general business or economic conditions generally affecting the industry in which LBS or Seneca operate;\n\u00b7 the taking of any action, or the failure to take any action, by the either party that is required to comply with the terms of Merger Agreement;\n\u00b7 any natural disaster or epidemics, pandemics (including COVID-19 or other outbreaks of diseases or quarantine restrictions), or other force majeure events, or any act or threat of terrorism or war, any armed hostilities or terrorist activities; or\n\u00b7 any change in, or any compliance with or action taken for the purpose of complying with, any law or GAAP (or interpretations of any law or GAAP).\nIf adverse changes occur and Seneca and LBS still complete the Merger, the stock price of the combined company following the closing of the Merger may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Merger to the stockholders of Seneca, LBS or both.\nSome executive officers and directors of Seneca and LBS have interests in the Merger that are different from the respective stockholders of Seneca and LBS and that may influence them to support or approve the Merger without regard to the interests of the respective stockholders of Seneca and LBS.\nSome officers and directors of Seneca and LBS are parties to arrangements that provide them with interests in the Merger that are different from the respective stockholders of Seneca and LBS, including, among others, service as an officer or director of the combined company following the closing of the Merger, severance benefits, the acceleration of equity award vesting, and continued indemnification.\nBased on the terms of their respective agreements, Seneca\u2019s recently terminated executive officers may be entitled to receive a total value of $3,425,613 (collectively, not individually) in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the associated termination of their employment from Seneca and the cancelation of their stock options. Additionally, Seneca\u2019s recently terminated senior vice president of research and development will be entitled to receive a total value of $865,438. In addition, in connection with the Merger, the executive officers of LBS entered into new employment agreements and are entitled to receive cash bonuses, certain executive officers are entitled to receive equity grants, and members of the LBS Board are entitled to receive cash bonuses.\nThe market price of Seneca Common Stock following the Merger may decline as a result of the Merger.\nThe market price of Seneca Common Stock may decline as a result of the Merger for a number of reasons, including if:\n\u00b7 investors react negatively to the prospects of the combined company\u2019s business and prospects following the closing of the Merger;\n\u00b7 the effect of the Merger on the combined company\u2019s business and prospects following the closing of the Merger is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u00b7 the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by stockholders or financial or industry analysts.\nLBS and Seneca securityholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over the management of, the combined company following the closing of the Merger as compared to their current ownership and voting interest in the respective companies.\nAfter the completion of the Merger, the current securityholders of LBS and Seneca will own a smaller percentage of the combined company than their ownership in their respective companies prior to the Merger. Immediately after the Merger, it is currently estimated that the former LBS equity holders immediately before the Merger (including the investor in the Pre-Merger Financing) are expected to hold approximately 73.8% of the capital stock of Seneca outstanding immediately following the Merger and the equity holders of Seneca immediately before the Merger are expected to hold approximately 26.2% of the Seneca capital stock outstanding immediately following the Merger, in each case, as calculated on an adjusted fully diluted treasury stock method basis and after giving effect to the Pre-Merger Financing, but including 50% of the shares subject to the Equity Warrants. These estimates are based on the anticipated Exchange Ratio and are subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement.\nDuring the pendency of the Merger, Seneca and LBS may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective businesses.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement impede the ability of Seneca and LBS to make acquisitions, subject to specified exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, or complete other mergers, sales of assets (other than the sale of the Seneca Legacy Technology) or other business combinations that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the Merger. As a result, if the Merger is not completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during that period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into specified extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination, with any third party, subject to specified exceptions, even if any such transaction could be favorable to such party\u2019s stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting competing proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each of Seneca and LBS from soliciting competing proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except in limited circumstances when such party\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor, if any, and outside counsel, that an unsolicited competing proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a superior competing proposal and that failure to take such action would result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the board of directors. In addition, if Seneca or LBS terminate the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including terminating because of a decision of a board of directors to recommend a superior competing proposal, LBS may be required to pay Seneca a termination fee of $1.5 million and/or $250,000 in expense reimbursements or Seneca may be required to pay LBS a termination fee of $1.5 million, or up to $250,000 in expense reimbursements.\nBecause the lack of a public market for LBS\u2019s capital stock makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Merger, the shareholders of LBS may receive consideration in the Merger that is less than the fair market value of LBS\u2019s capital stock and/or Seneca may pay more than the fair market value of LBS\u2019s capital stock.\nThe outstanding capital stock of LBS is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of LBS\u2019s capital stock. Because the percentage of Seneca equity to be issued to LBS shareholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of the Seneca Common Stock to be received by LBS shareholders will be less than the fair market value of LBS\u2019s capital stock, or Seneca may pay more than the aggregate fair market value for LBS\u2019s capital stock. The combined organization will incur significant transaction costs as a result of the Merger, including investment banking, legal and accounting fees. In addition, the combined organization will incur significant operating expenses which cannot be accurately estimated at this time. Actual transaction costs may substantially exceed the Party\u2019s estimates and may have an adverse effect on the combined organization\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nIf Nasdaq does not approve our listing application for the combined company and we continue with the Merger, we may be subject to delisting.\nSeneca has filed an initial listing application with Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq\u2019s \u201creverse merger\u201d rules. In the event our application is not accepted by the Nasdaq and the parties proceed with the merger, the combined company will be subject to delisting proceedings and could be delisted. If Seneca\u2019s shares lose their status on the Nasdaq Capital Market, Seneca believes that its shares would likely be eligible to be quoted on the inter-dealer electronic quotation and trading system operated by Pink OTC Markets Inc., commonly referred to as the Pink Sheets and now known as the OTCQB market. These markets are generally considered not to be as efficient as, and not as broad as, the Nasdaq Capital Market. If Seneca\u2019s common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair its ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for Seneca. Additionally, investors would find it more difficult to buy and sell shares of Seneca Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Seneca\u2019s Capital Requirements, Finances and Operations in the event the Merger is Not Completed\nThere is no assurance that the proposed Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. If the Merger is not consummated, our business could suffer materially, and its stock price could decline.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including approval by Seneca\u2019s and LBS\u2019s respective stockholders and other customary closing conditions. The parties are targeting a closing of the transaction in the first half of 2021, however, there can be no assurance that the merger will be consummated within this desired timeframe, or at all.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, we may be subject to a number of material risks, and our business and stock price could be adversely affected, as follows:\n\u00b7 We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the Merger, even if the Merger is not consummated;\n\u00b7 We could be obligated to pay a $1.5 million termination fee and expense reimbursements up to $250,000 in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement, depending on the reason for the termination;\n\u00b7 The market price of our Common Stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed; and\n\u00b7 Nasdaq could determine to delist our Common Stock, which could have an adverse effect on the value of our Common Stock and any future ability to raise capital.\nIf the Merger is not completed, we may be unsuccessful in completing an alternative transaction on terms that are as favorable as the terms of the proposed transaction, or at all, and we may be unable to reestablish a viable operating business.\nWe have generated limited revenue to date from royalties under a settlement agreement and have not generated revenue from any product sales. Our assets currently consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, our intellectual property portfolio, a settlement agreement pursuant to which it has received royalties, its remaining assets and its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market. While we have entered into the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the Merger may be delayed or may not occur at all. If the Merger is not completed, our board of directors may elect to pursue an alternative strategic transaction which is similar to the proposed Merger. Attempting to complete an alternative transaction will be costly and time consuming. If the Merger is not completed and our board of directors determines to pursue an alternative transaction, the terms of any such alternative transaction may not be as favorable to Seneca and its stockholders as the terms of the Merger. We can make no assurances that such an alternative transaction would occur at all. Further, if the Merger is not completed, given the level of investment and time that would be required to redesign its products or pursue the development of products and services pursuant to its collaboration agreements, it is unlikely that we would be able to obtain the funding required to recommence its product development activities on terms favorable to its stockholders, or at all.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our business. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger is not completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our assets. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision, as with the passage of time the amount of cash available for distribution will be reduced as we continue to fund our operations. In addition, if our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of Seneca, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to its stockholders. As a result of this requirement, our remaining cash may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of our business. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our Common Stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nIf we were to continue to advance our research and development activities and pursue development of any of our pipeline products, it would require substantial additional funding. Raising additional capital would cause dilution to our existing stockholders and may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or to a product candidate.\nWe currently do not have any committed source of funds and do not expect to generate any commercial revenue in the foreseeable future. We believe in the event the Merger is not consummated that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements under our current operating plan through at least March 2022. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and it may use its available capital resources sooner than it currently expects if its operating plans change. If the Merger is not completed and Seneca decides to pursue further research and development activities, it will require substantial additional funding to operate, and would expect to finance these cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding and licensing or collaboration arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted. In addition, the terms of any equity or convertible debt that we agree to issue may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Convertible debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, and declaring dividends, and may impose limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nAdditional funds may not be available to us when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, when and if needed. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or cease its operations.\nIf the Merger is not completed, raising additional funding through debt or equity financing could be difficult or not successful at all, would be dilutive and may cause the market price of our Common Stock to further decline.\nIf the Merger is not completed, raising additional funding through debt or equity financing could be difficult or unavailable altogether given the turbulent financial markets. To the extent that Seneca raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of those securities would result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of its common stock to decline further and existing stockholders may not agree with its financing plans or the terms of such financings.\nRisks Related to Seneca\nWe have a history of losses.\nSince inception in 1996 through December 31, 2020, we have accumulated losses totaling approximately $238 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had a working capital surplus of approximately $10 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $10 million. Our net losses for the two most recent fiscal years have been approximately $16 million and $8 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from the commercial sale of our proposed products. No assurances can be given as to exactly when, if at all, we will be able to fully develop, commercialize, market, sell and/or derive any, let alone material, revenues from our proposed products.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to continue operations.\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations through the sale of our securities, credit facilities, the exercise of options and warrants, and to a lesser degree, from grants and research contracts and other revenue generating activities such as licensing. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $10.5 million. We anticipate that in the event the Merger is not consummated, and based on our cash position at December 31, 2020, we will be able to fund our operations beyond 12 months from this filing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional capital through financing transactions, including issuance of debt, licensing agreements or grants. Our inability to license our intellectual property, obtain grants or secure additional financing will materially impact our ability to fund our current and planned operations.\nWe are substantially dependent on our remaining employees and consultants to facilitate the consummation of the Merger.\nAs of March 17, 2021, as a result of entering into separation agreements with four employees, including our executive chairman, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, and Senior VP of R&D, we had only three full-time employees. Such remaining employees\u2019 employment will be terminated upon the closing of the Merger. While we were able to secure consulting agreements with certain recently separated employees, our ability to successfully complete the Merger depends in large part on our ability to retain certain of our remaining personnel. Despite our efforts to retain these employees and consultants, one or more may terminate their employment or consulting agreements on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these employees or consultants could potentially harm our ability to consummate the Merger, to run our day-to-day business operations, as well as to fulfill our reporting obligations as a public company.\nManagement transition creates uncertainties and could harm Seneca\u2019s business.\nWe have in the past, and expect to in the future, experience significant changes in executive leadership. Changes to company strategy, which can often times occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of Seneca\u2019s operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style. Management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution. Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer as a result. In any event, changes in our organization as a result of executive management transition may have a disruptive impact on our ability to implement its strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pendency of the Merger could have an adverse effect on the trading price of Seneca\u2019s Common Stock and Seneca\u2019s business, financial condition and prospects.\nWhile there have been no significant adverse effects to date, the pendency of the Merger could disrupt Seneca\u2019s business in many ways, including:\n\u00b7 the attention of our remaining management and employees may be directed toward the completion of the Merger and related matters and may be diverted from our day-to-day business operations; and\n\u00b7 third parties may seek to terminate or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements or otherwise.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock or harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern if we do not obtain additional financing.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and have not demonstrated an ability to generate revenues from the sales of our proposed products. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital from the sale of its common stock and/or obtaining debt financing. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance at December 31, 2020 was approximately $10.5 million. Based on our current expected level of operating expenditures, and assuming the Merger is not consummated, we expect to be able to fund our operations beyond 12 months from this filing. Our ability to remain a going concern is wholly dependent upon our ability to continue to obtain sufficient capital to fund our operations. Despite our ability to secure capital in the past, there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing will be available to us when needed or that we may be able to secure funding from any other sources. In the event that we are not able to secure funding, we may be forced to curtail operations, cease operations altogether or file for bankruptcy.\nOur auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors\u2019 report on our December 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements included an explanatory paragraph that expressed substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Our current cash level raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern at least through March 2022. If we do not obtain additional capital, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and may cease operation or seek bankruptcy protection.\nWe are involved in litigation in connection with the Merger and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all related costs and damages.\nStockholder litigation frequently follows the announcement of certain significant business transactions, such as a business combination transaction. As of March 16, 2021, there were nine complaints filed by purported Seneca stockholders, Sheridan v. Seneca Biopharma, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00166 (the \u201cSheridan Complaint\u201d); Pirjamaat v. Seneca Biopharma, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00172 (the \u201cPirjamaat Complaint\u201d); Johnson v. Seneca Biopharma, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00310 (the \u201cJohnson Complaint\u201d); Mathews v. Seneca Biopharma, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00242 (the \u201cMathews Complaint\u201d); Pechal v. Seneca Biopharma, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00585 (the \u201cPechal Complaint\u201d), Curtis v. Seneca Biopharma, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00292 (the \u201cCurtis Complaint\u201d); Valdez v. Seneca Biopharma, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00980 (the \u201cValdez Complaint\u201d); Anderson v. Seneca Biopharma, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00326 (the \u201cAnderson Complaint\u201d); and McIntire v. Seneca Biopharma, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01869 (the \u201cAnderson Complaint\u201d and, together with the Sheridan Complaint, the Pirjamaat Complaint, the Johnson Complaint, the Matthews Complaint, the Curtis Complaint, the Valdez Complaint, and the Anderson Complaint, the \u201cStockholder Complaints\u201d). The Stockholder Complaints assert claims against us, the members of our board of directors as defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder for allegedly false and misleading statements in in the registration statement filed on Form S-4 in February 2021 and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability with respect to such allegedly false and misleading statements. The Stockholder Complaints assert claims against Seneca, the members of the Seneca Board, and LBS as defendants under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder for allegedly false and misleading statements in this proxy statement/prospectus/information statement and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act for alleged \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability with respect to such allegedly false and misleading statements. The Johnson Complaint also asserts that the members of the Seneca Board breached their fiduciary duties of candor/disclosure in connection with the Merger by purportedly failing to disclose material information about the Merger.\nEach of the Stockholder Complaints seek, among other relief, injunctive relief, including enjoining the Merger unless and until the defendants disclose the allegedly omitted material information, as well as an award of attorneys\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees. The Mathews Complaint also seeks to enjoin any vote on the Merger; the Sheridan Complaint, the Johnson Complaint, and the McIntire Complaint seek damages; the Sheridan Complaint, the Pirjamaat Complaint, the Mathews Complaint, the Curtis Complaint, the Valdez Complaint, and the Anderson Complaint, seek, in the event the defendants consummate the merger, rescission of the Merger or an award of rescissory damages; the Pirjamaat Complaint, the Curtis Complaint, and the Valdez Complaint seek an order directing the Seneca Board to disseminate a revised registration statement in compliance with Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9; and the Pirjamaat Complaint, the Mathews Complaint, the Curtis Complaint, the Valdez Complaint, and the Anderson Complaint seek a declaration that defendants violated Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9.\nWe believe the allegations in the Stockholder Complaints are without merit.\nOther stockholders may file additional lawsuits challenging the Merger, which may name us as well as members of our boards of directors and/or others as defendants. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of such lawsuits or the Stockholder Complaints, including the amount of costs associated with defending, or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of, such claims. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. At present, we are unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to the lawsuit.\nRisks Relating to Seneca\u2019s Business\nSeneca\u2019s business is dependent on the successful development of product candidates that it has yet to acquire or license.\nOur business is significantly dependent on the successful development of product candidates that we have yet to acquire or license. If we are successful in-licensing or acquiring product candidates, the process to approve of such product candidates is time-consuming, involves substantial expenditures of resources, and depends upon a number of factors, including the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in its clinical trials. Our success will depend on our ability to achieve scientific and technological advances and to translate such advances into FDA-approvable, commercially competitive products on a timely basis. Failure can occur at any stage of the process. If we are not successful in our in-licensing and acquisition strategy, we will have invested substantial amounts of time and money without developing revenue-producing products.\nAny product candidate we are able to license or acquire will likely not be commercially available for at least several years, if at all. Development schedules for future product candidates may be affected by a variety of factors, including difficulties in identifying and in-licensing or acquiring such future products candidates, technological difficulties, clinical trial delays or failures, regulatory hurdles, competitive products, intellectual property challenges and/or changes in governmental regulation, many of which will not be within our control. In light of the long-term nature of these types of projects, the technology potentially involved, and the other factors there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the development or marketing of any product candidates.\nThe technologies we intend to out-license may not be able to be commercially developed.\nWe have allocated most of our resources to the development of our stem cell and small molecule technologies. These are emerging technologies which may be deemed to have limited human application. If potential licensees or acquirors believe that these technologies have limited human applications, we may not be able to out-license, on acceptable terms or at all, our technologies. Failure to out-license or sell our stem cell or small molecule technologies may materially impact the value of its business.\nWe are unable to predict when or if we will be able to earn significant revenues.\nGiven that we have yet to in-license or acquire new technologies, it cannot predict when, or if ever, we will be able to realize revenues related to our future products. Even if in-licensed or acquired, these products are not likely to be commercially available for at least several or more years, if ever. Accordingly, we do not foresee generating any significant revenue during such time. As a result, we will be primarily dependent on its ability to raise capital through the sale of its securities to fund its operations for the foreseeable future.\nWe may be subject to litigation that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome.\nOur business may bring us into conflict with licensees, licensors, or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. If we are unable to resolve these conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against such parties. Any litigation is likely to be expensive and may require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention, at the expense of other aspects of our business. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and in some cases, could include judgments against us which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on a limited number of employees and consultants for our continued operations and future success.\nWe are highly dependent on a limited number of employees and outside consultants. The loss of any of our employees or consultants could adversely affect our opportunities and materially harm our future prospects. In the event the Merger is not completed, and our board of directors elects to continue our business, we will need additional management personnel as well as the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nWe have entered into employment contracts with members of our senior management team that contain significant anti-termination provisions.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with members of its senior management team. These agreements require the payment of severance in the event one of these employees ceases to be employed. These provisions make the replacement of these employees very costly and could cause difficulty in effecting any required changes in management or a change in control. In the event the Merger is consummated, we will be obligated to pay members of our management team an aggregate of $4,291,051. Please see the Section of the Annual Report Entitled \u201cExecutive Compensation.\u201d\nBusiness or economic disruptions, or global health concerns could seriously harm our development efforts and increase our costs and expenses.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our planned research and development activities as well as the execution of our acquisition and/or in-licensing strategy. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread around the world, including to the United States. To date, this outbreak has already resulted in extended shutdowns of many businesses around the world, including in the United States. At this time, the impact on our business has been that employees who previously worked in our corporate office and who traveled are now limited to home office work and virtual meetings. Global health concerns, such as coronavirus, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we or the third parties with whom we engage operate. We cannot presently predict the scope, severity and longevity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom it engages or plans to engage, including the suppliers, clinical trial sites, regulators and other third parties with whom we conduct business or plan to conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted. It is also possible that global health concerns such as this one could disproportionately impact the hospitals and clinical sites in which we may conduct any of its clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation and financial condition.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate information about our products and the diseases that our therapies are designed to treat. Social media practices in our industry continue to evolve and regulations related to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients and others may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, we may fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend against political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or Seneca otherwise fails to comply with applicable regulations, it could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to its business.\nRisks Relating to Seneca\u2019s Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to withstand challenges to our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on our intellectual property, including issued and applied-for patents, as the foundation of our business. Our intellectual property rights may come under challenge. No assurances can be given that our current and potential future patents will survive such challenges. These cases are complex, lengthy, expensive, and could potentially be adjudicated adversely to our interests, removing the protection afforded by an issued patent. The viability of our business would suffer if such patent protection were limited or eliminated. Moreover, the costs associated with defending or settling intellectual property claims would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect against the piracy of the intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe have conducted research in countries outside of the U.S., including through our subsidiary in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Several of our competitors are located in these countries and may be able to access our technology or test results. The laws protecting intellectual property in some of these countries may not adequately protect our trade secrets and intellectual property. The misappropriation of our intellectual property may materially impact our position in the market and any competitive advantages, if any, that it may have.\nWe may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and may not be able to obtain necessary licenses to third-party patents and other rights.\nA number of companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or have received patents relating to technologies in our field. We cannot predict which, if any, of these applications will issue as patents or how many of these issued patents will be found valid and enforceable. There may also be existing issued patents on which we would infringe by the commercialization of our product candidates. If so, we may be prevented from commercializing these products unless the third party is willing to grant us a license. We may be unable to obtain licenses to the relevant patents at a reasonable cost, if at all, and may also be unable to develop or obtain alternative non-infringing technology. If we are unable to obtain such licenses or develop non-infringing technology at a reasonable cost, our business could be materially harmed. Any infringement lawsuits commenced against us may result in significant costs, divert its management\u2019s attention and result in an award against it for substantial damages, or potentially prevent it from continuing certain operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common shares is particularly volatile.\nThe market for our common shares is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than those of a seasoned issuer. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. Mainly however, we are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to our limited operating history, lack of significant revenues to date and the uncertainty of FDA approval. By way of example, in July of 2019, we completed a firm commitment underwritten public offering of our securities. During the marketing of the offering and post-closing, the market price or our common stock decreased substantially. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer. Additionally, in the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe following factors may add to the volatility in the price of our common shares: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; the results of clinical trials for our product candidates; FDA\u2019s determination with respect to filings for new clinical studies, new drug applications and new indications; government regulations; announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; our capital commitments; offerings of our securities and additions or departures of key personnel. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common shares will be at any time, including as to whether our common shares will sustain their current market prices, or as to what effect the sale of shares or the availability of common shares for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.\nIf Seneca\u2019s common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, Seneca would be subject to the risks relating to penny stocks.\nIf Seneca\u2019s common stock were to be delisted from trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the trading price of its common stock were below $5.00 per share on the date its common stock is delisted, trading in Seneca\u2019s common stock would also be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, generally institutions. These additional requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in securities that are classified as penny stocks, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of such securities and the ability of purchasers to sell such securities in the secondary market. A penny stock is defined generally as any non-exchange listed equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall.\nIn January 2020, we completed an inducement offering pursuant to which we reduced the exercise price of outstanding warrants in exchange for the holder exercising such warrants for cash. As a result, we issued 5,555,554 shares of common stock, or approximately 61% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Transactions, such as the inducement offering, that result in a large amount of newly issued shares that are readily tradable, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the lack of a robust trading market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of Seneca\u2019s stock. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities on terms that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nCertain of our outstanding common stock purchase warrants contain price protection provisions (anti-dilution protection) in the event that we sell securities at prices lower than the current exercise price of such warrants.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 149,149 common stock purchase warrants outstanding that were issued in our May 2016 registered offering, May 2016 private placement and August 2017 registered offering. All of such warrants contain price protection provisions in the event that we sell securities at a price per share below their respective exercise prices (collectively \u201cPrice Protection Warrants\u201d). Pursuant to our May 2020 common stock offering, the Price Protection Warrants all had their exercise prices adjusted to $0.90 per share. In the event that Seneca sells securities at a price per share lower than the current exercise price of the Price Protection Warrants, their exercise prices will be further reduced. Any future adjustments to the exercise prices of the Price Protection Warrants may have a negative impact on the trading price of Seneca\u2019s common stock. Additionally, raising additional capital with new investors may be difficult as a result of the adjustment feature.\nCertain of our outstanding common stock purchase options contain provisions (anti-dilution protection) in the event that we issue additional securities, which may have a negative impact on its capital structure and may result in significant dilution to our shareholders or impair our ability to raise capital.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1,686,466 outstanding common stock purchase options held by certain members of its senior management team. These options contain provisions which have resulted in the adjustment of the shares underlying such options in order that the holder maintains his proportionate ownership. Any future adjustments to the number of shares may have a negative impact on our capital structure and dilute our other shareholders. Additionally, raising additional capital with new investors may be difficult as a result of the adjustment feature. As of the date hereof, each of the option holders have agreed, subject to entering into definitive agreements, to cancel their respective outstanding options in exchange for certain cash payments.\nOur anti-takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change of control, which could adversely affect the price of its common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make it difficult to remove its board of directors and management and may discourage or delay \u201cchange of control\u201d transactions, which could adversely affect the price of its common stock. These provisions include, among others:\n\u00b7 Our board of directors are divided into three classes, with each class serving for a staggered three-year term, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting;\n\u00b7 Advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors and propose matters to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of Seneca; and\n\u00b7 Our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue series of preferred stock, or rights to acquire preferred stock, that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of our common stock or could also be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports, or publish unfavorable research about our business, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. In the event an analyst downgrades our securities, the price of our securities would likely decline. If analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports, interest in our securities could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and other securities and their trading volume to decline.\nOur board of directors has broad discretion to issue additional securities, which might dilute the net tangible book value per share of our common stock for existing stockholders.\nWe are entitled under our certificate of incorporation to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 7,000,000 \u201cblank check\u201d shares of preferred stock. Shares of our blank check preferred stock provide our board of directors with broad authority to determine voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights. As of December 31, 2020, we had issued and outstanding 17,295,703 shares of common stock and 6,750,287 shares of common stock reserved for future grants under its equity compensation plans and for issuances upon the exercise or conversion of currently outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had 200,000 shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding which are convertible into 38,873 shares of common stock. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, we are entitled to issue up to 275,954,010 additional shares of common stock and 6,800,000 additional shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Our board of directors may generally issue those common and preferred shares, or convertible securities to purchase those shares, without further approval by our shareholders. Any preferred shares we may issue will have such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as may be designated from time-to-time by our board, including preferential dividend rights, voting rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and liquidation provisions. It is likely that we will be required to issue a large amount of additional securities to raise capital in order to further its development and marketing plans. It is also likely that we will be required to issue a large amount of additional securities to directors, officers, employees and consultants as compensatory grants in connection with their services, both in the form of stand-alone grants or under our various stock plans. The issuance of additional securities may cause substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on Seneca\u2019s business, financial condition and stock price.\nFrom time to time, including recently as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. Seneca\u2019s general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on Seneca\u2019s growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require Seneca to delay or abandon clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of Seneca\u2019s current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive an economic down-turn, which could directly affect Seneca\u2019s ability to attain Seneca\u2019s operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Approval of Therapeutic Product Candidates.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and our products may not receive regulatory approval.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is inherently unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a drug candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions and countries.\nIf we are successful in in-licensing or acquiring therapeutic drug candidates, we could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022 the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022 we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022 the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a BLA, NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u2022 the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWe cannot assure you that we will successfully in-license or acquire any technologies or complete any clinical trials in connection with such technologies. Further, we cannot predict when we might first submit any product license application (NDA or BLA) for FDA approval or whether any such product license application will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, such approvals could have a material adverse effect on the marketing of our products and our ability to generate product revenue.\nDevelopment of therapeutics product candidates is subject to extensive government regulation.\nThe process of obtaining FDA and other necessary regulatory approvals is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. FDA and other legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our proposed products, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries could substantially change. We may fail to obtain the necessary approvals to commence clinical testing or to manufacture or market our potential products in reasonable time frames, if at all. In addition, the U.S. Congress and other legislative bodies may enact regulatory reforms or restrictions on the development of new therapies that could adversely affect the regulatory environment in which we operate or the development of any products we may develop.\nNoncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can subject us, our third party suppliers and manufacturers and our other collaborators to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as, among other things, warning letters, fines and other monetary payments, recall or seizure of products, criminal proceedings, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, interruption or cessation of clinical trials, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, limitations on or the elimination of claims we can make for our products, refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts or fund research, or government delay in approving or refusal to approve new drug applications.\nWe cannot predict if or when we will be able to commercialize our products due to regulatory constraints.\nFederal, state and local governments and agencies in the U.S. (including the FDA) and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern many of our activities. We are, or may become, subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with its research and development work. The preclinical testing and clinical trials of our proposed products are subject to extensive government regulation that may prevent us from creating commercially viable products. In addition, our sale of any commercially viable product will be subject to government regulation from several standpoints, including manufacturing, advertising, marketing, promoting, selling, labeling and distributing. If, and to the extent that, we are unable to comply with these regulations, our ability to earn revenues, if any, will be materially and negatively impacted.", "PERMNO": 92252, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SNCA"}
