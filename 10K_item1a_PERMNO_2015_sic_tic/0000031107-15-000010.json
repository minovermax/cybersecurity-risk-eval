{"cik": "31107", "company": "EASTERN CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto and the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations, such as: changes in the economy, including changes in inflation, tax rates and interest rates; risk associated with possible disruption in the Company\u2019s operations due to terrorism and other manmade or natural disasters; future regulatory actions, legal issues or environmental matters; loss of, or changes in, executive management; and changes in accounting standards which are adverse to the Company. Also, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas.\nInternational operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights, and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings, and may adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s assets outside the United States. The Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. Although generally these trade agreements have positive effects, they can also impose requirements that adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, such as setting quotas on product that may be imported from a particular country into the Company\u2019s key markets in North America.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nSee also \u201cITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company\u2019s products in these foreign markets.\nIncreases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials.\nRaw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Company\u2019s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reduction to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company\u2019s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner.\nIncreased competition in the markets the Company services could impact revenues and earnings.\nAny change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While the Company has an extensive customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.\nThe Company is required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe Company is an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company\u2019s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock or impact the Company\u2019s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nThe inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit future growth.\nAs part of its growth strategy, the Company continues to pursue acquisitions of complementary products or businesses. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. The Company makes certain assumptions based on the information provided by potential acquisition candidates and also conducts due diligence to ensure the information provided is accurate and based on reasonable assumptions. However, the Company may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or predict accurately how an acquisition will ultimately affect the business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDemand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings.\nThe uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company\u2019s failure to accurately predict market demand or its inability to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.\nThe Company could be subject to litigation which could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company\u2019s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available information, that the resolution of any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. See \u201cITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u201d in this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation.\nThe Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to income tax laws in the United States, its states and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation is required in determining the Company\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company\u2019s income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company\u2019s reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.\nThe Company\u2019s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings to be recognized.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation of impairment, and there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm would reach the same conclusion as the Company or an independent valuation firm, which could result in a disagreement between management and the independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe Company may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFrom time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company\u2019s financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is highly volatile due to low float, which is the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that are outstanding and available for trading by the public.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares.\nThe Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production.\nDuring 2015, none of the union contracts covering the workforce of the Company will expire. The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years, but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in disruption of production, inability to deliver product or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial statements.\nDeterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncluded as a significant asset on the Company\u2019s balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers. If several large customers become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial statements.\nAlthough the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial statements. No customers exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2014, 2013 or 2012.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing the Company\u2019s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Quarterly, year to date and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue may differ significantly from historical or projected rates. Future operating results may fall below expectations. These types of events could cause the price of the Company\u2019s stock to fall.\nNew or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies.", "PERMNO": 31480, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "EML"}
