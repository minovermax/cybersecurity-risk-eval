{"cik": "1084580", "company": "Jefferies Group LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nThe following factors describe some of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect our business or that could otherwise result in changes that differ materially from our expectations. In addition to the specific factors mentioned in this report, we may also be affected by other factors that affect businesses generally such as global or regional changes in economic, business or political conditions, acts of war, terrorism, climate change and natural disasters.\nLegislation and new and pending regulation may significantly affect our business.\nThere is significant legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. These legislative and regulatory initiatives affect not only us, but also our competitors and certain of our clients. These changes could have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations already adopted by the CFTC and still to be adopted by the SEC and CFTC introduce a comprehensive regulatory regime for swaps and SBS and parties that deal in such derivatives. Two of our subsidiaries are provisionally registered as swap dealers with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. We may also be required in the future to register one or more additional subsidiaries as security-based swap dealers with the SEC. The SEC has adopted rules for capital, margin and segregation requirements with respect to SBS which will be effective in 2020 or 2021. Certain swaps have been made subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading and additional swaps and SBS may become subject to such requirements in the future. Pursuant to regulations adopted by the CFTC and bank regulators, swap dealers are required to post and collect variation margin (comprised of specified liquid instruments and subject to a haircut) in connection with the trading of un-cleared swaps. We have already incurred significant compliance and operational costs as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act swap business conduct and mandatory variation margin rules, and when all the final rules contemplated by Title VII have been implemented, our swap dealer entities will also be subject to mandatory capital requirements that will likely have an effect on our business. The CFTC has adopted many regulations relating to swap dealers and swaps transactions, but a number of them have only recently become effective and certain requirements remain to be finalized. While there continues to be uncertainty about the full impact of these changes, we will continue to be subject to a more complex regulatory framework which will result in increased monitoring and compliance costs. Negative effects could result from an expansive extraterritorial application of the Dodd-Frank Act and/or insufficient international coordination with respect to adoption of rules for derivatives and other financial reforms in other jurisdictions.\nThe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d) relating to derivatives entered into force during August 2012 and introduced certain requirements in respect of derivative contracts including: (i) the mandatory clearing of OTC derivative contracts declared subject to the clearing obligation; (ii) risk mitigation techniques in respect of uncleared OTC derivative contracts, including the mandatory margining of uncleared OTC derivative contracts; and (iii) reporting and record keeping requirements in respect of all derivative contracts. EMIR\u2019s requirements apply to \u201cfinancial counterparties\u201d such as European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) authorized investment firms, credit institutions, insurance companies, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities and alternative investment funds managed by EU authorized alternative investment fund managers, and \u201cnon-financial counterparties\u201d (being an EU entity which is not a financial counterparty). EMIR applies to in-scope EU counterparties which transact derivatives with non-EU regulated entities, if such non-EU regulated entities would be classified as financial counterparties or non-financial counterparties if they were established in the EU. As a result, members of our group who are EU entities or subsidiaries and, when transacting with in-scope EU counterparties, members of our group who are non-EU regulated entities or subsidiaries may be subject to additional obligations and/or costs that may not otherwise have applied.\nDuring January 2018, the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Market in Financial Instruments Directive came into force (collectively referred to as \u201cMiFID II\u201d). MiFID II imposes certain restrictions as to the trading of shares and derivatives including new market structure-related, reporting, investor protection-related and organizational requirements, requirements on pre- and post-trade transparency, requirements to use certain venues when trading financial instruments (which includes shares and certain derivative instruments), requirements affecting the way investment managers can obtain research, powers of regulators to impose position limits and provisions on regulatory sanctions. Subject to certain conditions and exceptions we may be unable to trade shares or derivatives with in-scope counterparties other than as provided by MiFID II. The EU is also currently considering or executing upon significant revisions to laws covering: resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructure; administration of financial benchmarks; credit rating activities; anti-money-laundering controls; data security and privacy; remuneration principles and proportionality; new amendments to capital and liquidity standards; disclosures under the Basel regime aiming to increase market transparency and consistency and corporate governance in financial firms.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn May 2018, the EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) came into force replacing the EU Data Protection Directive. Where the GDPR applies, it imposes obligations including, among other things:\n\u2022\naccountability and transparency requirements, which require companies to demonstrate and record compliance with the GDPR and to provide more detailed information to data subjects regarding the processing of their personal data obligations to consider data protection when any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal data processed\n\u2022\ncompliance with the data protection rights of data subjects including a right of access to or correction of personal data and a right of erasure of personal data\n\u2022\nthe reporting of personal data breaches to the relevant data supervisory authority without undue delay (no later than 72 hours after discovering the data breach, where feasible) unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms.\nThe GDPR imposes significant fines for serious non-compliance of up to the higher of 4% of an organization\u2019s annual worldwide turnover or \u20ac20 million. Data subjects also have a right to compensation as a result of infringement of the GDPR for financial or non-financial losses.\nObligations under the GDPR and implementing member state legislation continue to evolve through legislation and regulatory guidance. In addition, numerous proposals regarding privacy and data protection are pending before U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act goes into effect in January 2020. The adopted form of such legislation and regulation will determine the level of any resources which we will need to invest to ensure compliance.\nIn addition, the scope, timing and final implementation of regulatory reform is uncertain and could negatively impact our business.\nExtensive regulation of our business limits our activities, and, if we violate these regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Firms that engage in providing financial services must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by national and state governments and regulatory and self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover many aspects of providing financial services.\nOur regulators supervise our business activities to monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules, or regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied. At any moment in time, we may be subject to one or more such investigations or similar reviews. At this time, all such investigations and similar reviews are insignificant in scope and immaterial to us. However, there can be no assurance that, in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate such laws, rules, or regulations, or that such investigations and similar reviews will not result in significant or material adverse regulatory requirements, regulatory enforcement actions, fines or other adverse impact to the operation of our business.\nAdditionally, violations of laws, rules and regulations could subject us to one or more of the following events: civil and criminal liability; sanctions, which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries\u2019 registrations as investment advisers or broker-dealers; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors; censures; fines; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory financial capital holding requirements, such as the Net Capital Rule, that could impact various capital allocation decisions or limit the operations of our broker-dealers. In particular, compliance with the Net Capital Rule may restrict our broker-dealers\u2019 ability to engage in capital-intensive activities such as underwriting and trading, and may also limit their ability to make loans, advances, dividends and other payments.\nAdditional legislation, changes in rules, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, conflicts and inconsistencies among rules and regulations, or the entering into businesses that subject us to new rules and regulations may directly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the impact of new U.S. and international regulation on our businesses.\nChanging financial, economic and political conditions could result in decreased revenues, losses or other adverse consequences.\nAs a global securities and investment banking firm, global or regional changes in the financial markets or economic and political conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nA market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\u2022\nUnfavorable conditions or changes in general political, economic or market conditions could reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting, financial advisory and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory and sales and trading or placement fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and could therefore be adversely affected by unfavorable financial, economic or political conditions. In particular, the increasing trend toward sovereign protectionism and deglobalization resulting from the current populist political movement has resulted or could result in decreases in free trade, erosion of traditional international coalitions, the imposition of sanctions and tariffs, governmental closures and no-confidence votes, domestic and international strife, and general market upheaval in response to such results, all of which could negatively impact our business\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the market could also lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees and losses on our own capital invested in managed funds. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could reduce asset management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the market could lead to regulatory restrictions that may limit or halt certain of our business activities\n\u2022\nLimitations on the availability of credit can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Global market and economic conditions have been particularly disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. Our cost and availability of funding could be affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads\n\u2022\nNew or increased taxes on compensation payments such as bonuses or on balance sheet items may adversely affect our profits\n\u2022\nShould one of our customers or competitors fail, our business prospects and revenue could be negatively impacted due to negative market sentiment causing customers to cease doing business with us and our lenders to cease loaning us money, which could adversely affect our business, funding and liquidity\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU could adversely affect our business.\nIn March 2017, the then Prime Minister of the U.K. notified the European Council, in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on EU, of the U.K.\u2019s intention to withdraw from the EU (such withdrawal commonly being referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The completion of Brexit has been postponed; and, it is possible that Brexit will not occur. There is uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the U.K. and the EU after Brexit (if it occurs). The uncertainty surrounding the timing, terms and consequences of Brexit could adversely impact customer and investor confidence, result in additional market volatility and adversely affect our businesses, including our revenues from trading and investment banking activities, particularly in Europe, and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate substantial parts of our EU businesses from entities based in the U.K. Following Brexit (if it occurs), the regulatory and legal environment that would then exist, and to which our U.K. operations would then be subject, will depend on, in certain respects, the nature of the arrangements (if any) that the U.K. may agree with the EU and other trading partners. While there is ongoing uncertainty, we have taken steps to ensure that we are able to continue to provide services to clients located in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) jurisdiction without interruption, even in the event of a \u201chard\u201d Brexit occurring. As such, a wholly-owned subsidiary, Jefferies GmbH, has been established in Germany which is authorised as a MiFID investment firm by BaFin. Jefferies GmbH will service EEA institutional clients across Investment Banking, Equities and Fixed Income sectors after Brexit from its office in Frankfurt and branch offices in Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan, Paris and Stockholm. This structure, if needed, might result in a less efficient operating model across our European legal entities.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (\u201cIBORs\u201d), in particular, London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d).\nCentral banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, the U.S., U.K., E.U., Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable replacements for IBORs. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021 and possibly prior to then. We currently hold IBOR positions with a maturation past 2020. In addition, we rely on vendor applications and data providers that support downstream IBOR data. We are reviewing our positions for a strategic conversion to alternative rates. It is not possible at this time to know what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR and other IBORs, or what the effect will be on the financial markets for financial instruments linked to IBORs. It is possible that pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, increased compliance, legal and operational costs, increased capital requirements and business continuity issues will occur.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nA change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense.\nWe are subject to tax in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, or the introduction of new taxes, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf our tax filing positions were to be challenged by federal, state and local, or foreign tax jurisdictions, we may not be wholly successful in defending our tax filing positions.\nWe record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which result could be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nMaintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. If we fail to deal with, or appear to fail to deal with, various issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A, appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money-laundering, cybersecurity and privacy, record keeping, sales and trading practices, failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels, and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products. A failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our prospects. Our operations in the past have been impacted as some clients either ceased doing business or temporarily slowed down the level of business they do, thereby decreasing our revenue. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully reverse the negative impact of allegations and rumors in the future and our potential failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business is subject to significant credit risk.\nIn the normal course of our businesses, we are involved in the execution, settlement and financing of various customer and principal securities and derivative transactions. These activities are transacted on a cash, margin or delivery-versus-payment basis and are subject to the risk of counterparty or customer nonperformance. Even when transactions are collateralized by the underlying security or other securities, we still face the risks associated with changes in the market value of the collateral through settlement date or during the time when margin is extended and collateral has not been secured or the counterparty defaults before collateral or margin can be adjusted. We may also incur credit risk in our derivative transactions to the extent such transactions result in uncollateralized credit exposure to our counterparties.\nWe seek to control the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily. We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return collateral pledged. In certain circumstances, we may, under industry regulations, purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty. However, there can be no assurances that our risk controls will be successful.\nA credit-rating agency downgrade could significantly impact our business.\nMaintaining an investment grade credit rating is important to our business and financial condition. If our credit ratings were downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged, which could adversely affect our client relationships. Additionally, we intend to access the capital markets and issue debt securities from time to time, and a decrease in our credit ratings or outlook could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities and increase the expense and difficulty of financing our operations. In addition, in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, we may be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Such a downgrade could also negatively impact the prices of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur principal trading and investments expose us to risk of loss.\nA considerable portion of our revenues is derived from trading in which we act as principal. We may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of fixed income, high yield, international, convertible, and equity securities, loans, derivative contracts and commodities for our own account. In any period, we may experience losses on our inventory positions as a result of the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices (including oil prices), lack of trading volume and illiquidity. From time to time, we may engage in a large block trade in a single security or maintain large position concentrations in a single security, securities of a single issuer, securities of issuers engaged in a specific industry, or securities from issuers located in a particular country or region. In general, because our inventory is marked to market on a daily basis, any adverse price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits. In addition, we may engage in hedging transactions that if not successful, could result in losses.\nWe are exposed to market risk.\nWe are, directly and indirectly, affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. For example, changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread, the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for sources of funding, which, in turn, impacts our net interest revenue and earnings. Changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities. In our brokerage operations, a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread. Conversely, in those operations, a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk, changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nMarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including trading account assets and liabilities, loans, securities, short-term borrowings, corporate debt, and derivatives. Market conditions that change from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, relative exchange rates, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.\nIn addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate, or realize the value of security positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet, thereby increasing capital requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nSee Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management within Part II, Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nWe may incur losses if our risk management is not effective.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure. Our risk management processes and procedures are designed to limit our exposure to acceptable levels as we conduct our business. We apply a comprehensive framework of limits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities. The size of the limit reflects our risk tolerance for a certain activity. Our framework includes inventory position and exposure limits on a gross and net basis, scenario analysis and stress tests, Value-at-Risk, sensitivities, exposure concentrations, aged inventory, amount of Level 3 assets, counterparty exposure, leverage, cash capital and performance analysis. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management within Part II. Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion. While we employ various risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application, including risk tolerance determinations, cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. As a result, we may incur losses notwithstanding our risk management processes and procedures.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent for liquidity from payments from our subsidiaries, many of which are subject to restrictions.\nAs a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to regulation that restrict dividend payments or reduce the availability of the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to us. In addition, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital requirements.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIncreased competition may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nAll aspects of our business are intensely competitive. We compete directly with a number of bank holding companies and commercial banks, other broker-dealers, investment banking firms and other financial institutions. In addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business, there has been increasing competition from others offering financial services, including automated trading and other services based on technological innovations. We believe that the principal factors affecting competition involve market focus, reputation, the abilities of professional personnel, transaction execution abilities, relative prices of the products and services being offered, bundling of products and services and the quality of products and service. Increased competition or an adverse change in our competitive position could lead to a reduction of business and therefore a reduction of revenues and profits.\nThe ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled and productive employees is critical to the success of our business.\nOur ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and skills of our professionals. To compete effectively, we must attract, retain and motivate qualified professionals, including successful financial advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel. Competitive pressures we experience with respect to employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nTurnover in the financial services industry is high. The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably. Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts, upfront payments, and increased compensation. These can be important factors in a current employee\u2019s decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee\u2019s decision to join us. As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense, we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nIf we were to lose the services of certain of our professionals, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. If we are unable to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. Further, new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses frequently require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.\nMoreover, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors often claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel who have worked for our competitors. Some of these claims may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims, regardless of their merits. Such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth.\nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume and complexity of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.\nCertain of our financial and other data processing systems rely on access to and the functionality of operating systems maintained by third parties. If the accounting, trading or other data processing systems on which we are dependent are unable to meet increasingly demanding standards for processing and security or, if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be adversely affected. Such consequences may include our inability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, despite the contingency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAny cyber attack or other security breach of or vulnerability in our technology systems, or those of our clients or other third-party vendors we rely on, could have operational impacts, subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of sensitive and confidential financial, personal and other information in our computer systems and networks. There have been several highly publicized cases involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information in recent years, as well as cyber attacks involving theft, dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets, in some cases as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties. Like other financial services firms, we have been the target of attempted cyber attacks. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third parties affiliated with foreign governments, organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to place individuals within our firm or induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent. Although cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms are on the rise, we are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches. However, the techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. Although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls, these controls could fail to detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. Despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, spam attacks, unauthorized access, distributed denial of service attacks, computer viruses and other malicious code, and other events that could result in significant liability and damage to our reputation, and have an ongoing impact on the security and stability of our operations.\nWe also rely on numerous third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations, and we face similar risks relating to them. While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third-party vendors, we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber attack or other security breach. In addition, in order to access our products and services, our customers may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems and processes.\nNotwithstanding the precautions we take, if a cyber attack or other information security breach were to occur, this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain, or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties, exposing us to liability. As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication, we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyber attacks to our customers. Though we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators. Additionally, the SEC issued guidance in February 2018 stating that, as a public company, we are expected to have controls and procedures that relate to cybersecurity disclosure, and are required to disclose information relating to certain cyber attacks or other information security breaches in disclosures required to be made under the federal securities laws. Further, successful cyber attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants, whether or not we are affected, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general, which could result in a loss of business.\nFurther, in light of the high volume of transactions we process, the large number of our clients, partners and counterparties, and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would take substantial amounts of time and resources, and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered. All of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack.\nWe may also be subject to liability under various data protection laws. In providing services to clients, we manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. federal, state and international laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. If any person, including any of our associates, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution. In addition, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through system failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue. Potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant. Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach, this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe face numerous risks and uncertainties as we expand our business.\nWe expect the growth of our business to come primarily from internal expansion and through acquisitions and strategic partnering. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that our financial controls, the level and knowledge of our personnel, our operational abilities, our legal and compliance controls and our other corporate support systems and technology will be adequate to manage our business and our growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, as we acquire new businesses and introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties integrating their controls and systems into ours, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient or non-secure integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nCertain business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses, may bring us into contact directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes and new markets. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, sovereign and operational risks and reputational concerns regarding the manner in which we conduct our business activities and the manner in which these assets are being operated or held.\nLegal liability may harm our business.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, and in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our business, including increases in the number and size of investment banking transactions and our expansion into new areas impose greater risks of liability. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects.\nEmployee misconduct, which is difficult to detect and deter, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nThere is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, current client relationships and ability to attract future clients. We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business. In addition, our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity, providing financial planning, investment advice, and discretionary asset management. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us. It is not always possible to deter associate misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective. If our employees engage in misconduct, our business would be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 86804, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "LUK2"}
