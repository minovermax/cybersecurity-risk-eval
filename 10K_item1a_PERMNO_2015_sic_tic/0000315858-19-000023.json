RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of our businesses, operations and investments, and general business, economic, financing, legal, regulatory, and other factors and conditions. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to either predict all risk factors or assess all potential impacts of any factor, or combination of factors, on BBX Capital Corporation or its subsidiaries, including with respect to their operations, results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital relies on dividends from Bluegreen to fund operations.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital has relied and continues to rely primarily on dividends from Bluegreen in order to fund its operations and investments. Dividends from Bluegreen may not be paid to BBX Capital in the amounts previously paid or when anticipated or at all. Bluegreen paid dividends totaling $40.4 million during 2018 and $40.0 million during 2017. The payment of dividends by Bluegreen is subject to compliance with financial covenants under its credit facilities and certain of Bluegreen's credit facilities contain terms which may limit the payment of cash dividends without the lender's consent or waiver. Additionally, the payment of dividends by Bluegreen will be at the discretion of Bluegreen\u2019s board of directors. Decisions with respect to dividends by Bluegreen are generally based on, among other things, Bluegreen's operating results, financial condition, cash flow, and liquidity needs. Dividend payments to BBX Capital by any of its subsidiaries, including Bluegreen, could, in certain circumstances, be subject to claims made by creditors of such subsidiary.\n\ufeff\nIf cash flow is not sufficient to fund BBX Capital's liquidity needs or BBX Capital otherwise determines it is advisable to do so, BBX Capital might seek to liquidate some of its investments or seek to fund its operations with the proceeds of additional equity or debt financing. Such financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and if BBX Capital chooses to liquidate its investments, it may be forced to do so at depressed prices.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital\u2019s acquisitions and investments may reduce earnings, require it to obtain additional financing and expose it to additional risks.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital\u2019s business strategy has included investments in or acquisitions of operating companies, such as its acquisition of Renin, IT\u2019SUGAR, and other businesses in the confectionery industry. BBX Capital may also seek to make opportunistic investments outside of its existing portfolio. Some of these investments and acquisitions may be material. While BBX Capital seeks to make investments and acquisitions primarily in companies that provide opportunities for growth, its investments or acquisitions may not prove to be successful or, even if successful, may not initially generate income, or may generate income on an irregular basis or over a long time period. Accordingly, our results of operations may vary significantly on a quarterly basis and from year to year as a result of acquisitions and investments. Acquisitions or investments will also expose BBX Capital, to the risks of the businesses acquired or invested in. Acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nRisks associated with achieving profitability;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in integrating and assimilating acquired management, acquired company founders, and operations;\n\u00b7 Unforeseen expenses and losses;\n\u00b7 Risks associated with entering new markets in which it has no or limited prior experience;\n\u00b7 The potential loss of key employees or founders of acquired organizations;\n\u00b7 Risks associated with transferred assets and liabilities; and\n\u00b7\nThe incurrence of significant due diligence expenses relating to acquisitions, including with respect to those that are not completed;\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital may not be able to integrate or profitably manage acquired businesses, including Renin, IT\u2019SUGAR, and its other operating businesses, without substantial costs, delays, or other operational or financial difficulties, including difficulties in integrating information systems and personnel and establishing control environment processes across acquired businesses. Further, BBX Capital may not be able to monitor the day to day activities of its investments in joint ventures, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nresults of operations. In addition, to the extent that operating businesses are acquired outside the United States or the State of Florida, there will be additional risks related to compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws, labor laws, currency fluctuations and geographic economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, in connection with seeking to identify and acquire new businesses, there is significant competition for investments and acquisitions, which could increase the costs associated with the investment or acquisition. Substantial costs are incurred in connection with the evaluation of potential acquisition and investment opportunities whether or not the acquisition or investment is ultimately consummated. Further, funding of such investments or acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing, which will subject BBX Capital to the risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors with respect to those activities in the immediately following risk factors. If BBX Capital requires additional financing in the future, the financing may not be available when needed or on favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, BBX Capital does not intend to seek shareholder approval of any investments or acquisitions unless required by law or regulation, or by BBX Capital\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital from time to time also pursues transactions involving the sale of its subsidiaries or investments or other transactions which would result in a decrease in BBX Capital\u2019s ownership interest in its subsidiaries. There is no assurance that any such transactions, if pursued and consummated, will generate a profit or otherwise be advantageous to BBX Capital.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital may issue additional securities and incur additional indebtedness at BBX Capital or its subsidiaries.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital may in the future seek to raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities. There is generally no restriction on BBX Capital\u2019s ability to issue debt or equity securities which are pari passu or have a preference over its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Authorized but unissued shares of BBX Capital\u2019s capital stock are available for issuance from time to time at the discretion of BBX Capital\u2019s board of directors, and any such issuance may be dilutive to BBX Capital\u2019s shareholders.\n\ufeff\nSubstantial sales of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock could adversely affect the market prices of such securities.\n\ufeff\nSubstantial sales of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, including sales of shares by controlling shareholders and management, could adversely affect the market prices of such securities. Management has in the past and may in the future enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans pursuant to which a significant number of shares are sold into the open market.\n\ufeff\nAlan B. Levan and John E. Abdo's control position may adversely affect the market price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\n\ufeff\nAlan B. Levan, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital, and John E. Abdo, the Vice Chairman of BBX Capital, collectively beneficially own shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 77% of the general voting power of BBX Capital. In addition, each of Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo has been granted restricted securities of BBX Capital which are scheduled to vest over time. Further, Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo are parties to an agreement pursuant to which Mr. Alan Levan has agreed to vote his shares of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock in favor of the election of Mr. Abdo to BBX Capital\u2019s board of directors for so long as he is willing and able to serve as a director of BBX Capital, and Mr. Abdo has granted to Mr. Alan Levan the right to vote his shares of Class B Common Stock so long as such Class B shares are beneficially owned by Mr. Abdo or his heirs, successors or assigns. Upon Mr. Alan Levan\u2019s death or disability, Jarett Levan, President of the Company, will succeed to Mr. Alan Levan\u2019s rights and obligations under the agreement with Mr. Abdo. Because BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote as a single class on most matters, Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo effectively have the voting power to elect the members of BBX Capital\u2019s board of directors and to control the outcome of any other vote of BBX Capital\u2019s shareholders, except in those limited circumstances where Florida law mandates that the holders of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock vote as a separate class. Mr. Alan Levan\u2019s and Mr. Abdo\u2019s control position may have an adverse effect on the market price of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. In addition, their interests may conflict with the interests of BBX Capital\u2019s other shareholders.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nProvisions in BBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as BBX Capital's shareholder rights plan, may make it difficult for a third party to acquire BBX Capital and could impact the price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of BBX Capital or its management. These provisions could make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. These provisions include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nThe provisions in BBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation regarding the special voting rights of BBX Capital 's Class B Common Stock;\n\u00b7\nSubject to the special class voting rights of holders of BBX Capital\u2019s Class B Common Stock under certain circumstances, the authority of BBX Capital's board of directors to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock and to fix the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock without additional shareholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nAdvance notice procedures to be complied with by shareholders in order to make shareholder proposals or nominate directors.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, BBX Capital\u2019s rights agreement, which was adopted and is designed to preserve certain tax benefits available to BBX Capital, may have an anti-takeover effect because the rights agreement provides a deterrent to investors from acquiring a 5% or greater ownership interest in BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\n\ufeff\nHolders of BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may not receive dividends in the amounts anticipated, when anticipated, or at all.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital\u2019s board of directors have declared regular quarterly cash dividend since June 2016 and has indicated its intention to declare regular quarterly dividends on BBX Capital\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. However, future dividends are subject to approval and declaration by BBX Capital\u2019s board of directors and, accordingly, BBX Capital may not make dividend payments in the future, whether in the amount anticipated, on a regular basis, or at all. The payment of dividends, if any, by BBX Capital will depend on many factors considered by its board of directors, including, without limitation, our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, market opportunities, and contractual constraints. Further, over time, the Company\u2019s cash needs may change significantly from its current needs, which could affect whether BBX Capital pays dividends and the amount of any dividends it may pay in the future. The terms of BBX Capital\u2019s indebtedness may also restrict it from paying cash dividends on its stock under certain circumstances. In addition, BBX Capital pays regular quarterly cash dividends of $125,000 with respect to its outstanding 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock. BBX Capital may not pay or set apart for payment any dividend or other distribution (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in common stock) on its Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock until such time as all accrued and unpaid dividends on BBX Capital\u2019s 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared or paid and a sum is set apart sufficient for payment of such accrued and unpaid dividends.\n\ufeff\nThere are risks associated with BBX Capital\u2019s recently announced plan to take Bluegreen private pursuant to a statutory short-form merger under Florida law.\n\ufeff\nOn March 4, 2019, BBX Capital announced its intention to take Bluegreen private through a short-form merger under Florida law pursuant to which BBX Capital will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Bluegreen\u2019s common stock not currently owned by BBX Capital. If the proposed merger is completed, Bluegreen will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of BBX Capital, and each share of Bluegreen\u2019s common stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger, other than shares beneficially owned by BBX Capital and shareholders who duly exercise and perfect appraisal rights in accordance with Florida law, will be converted into the right to receive $16.00 per share in cash. BBX Capital expects to fund the total merger consideration estimated to be approximately $115.0 million with its existing liquidity which reduces its liquidity for other purposes. The merger is expected to be completed 30 days after the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC relating to the merger is first mailed to Bluegreen's shareholders, or as soon as practicable thereafter. However, the merger may be terminated at any time before it becomes effective, and there is no assurance that the merger will be consummated on the contemplated terms, or at all. If the merger is consummated, BBX Capital\u2019s ownership interest in Bluegreen will increase from approximately 90.3% to 100%, and accordingly, BBX Capital\u2019s exposure to the risks of ownership of Bluegreen, including the business, industry, and the other risks described in this Risk Factors section under \u201cBluegreen\u201d below, will increase. In addition, Bluegreen\u2019s shareholders\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwill have appraisal rights under Florida law if the merger is consummated. Shareholders of Bluegreen who exercise and perfect appraisal rights will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the fair value of their shares as determined in accordance with Florida law, which may be more than, less than, or equal to the $16.00 per share merger consideration, and accordingly, the total amount payable to Bluegreen\u2019s shareholders in connection with the merger may be more than expected. Further, the fair value of Bluegreen\u2019s shares under Florida\u2019s appraisal rights statutes may be determined by a court in litigation, which is inherently uncertain and may require the incurrence of significant expenses and significant devotion of management time, regardless of the outcome of the appraisal rights litigation. In addition, BBX Capital may not realize the benefits expected from taking Bluegreen private to the extent anticipated, or at all.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\n\ufeff\nBluegreen is subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the vacation ownership industry, any of which could adversely impact its business, prospects and results.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the vacation ownership industry, including, without limitation:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nSignificant competition from other vacation ownership businesses and hospitality providers;\n\u00b7\nMarket and/or consumer perception of vacation ownership companies and the industry in general;\n\u00b7\nIncreases in operating and other costs (as a result of inflation or otherwise), including marketing costs, employee compensation and benefits, interest expense and insurance, which may not be offset by price or fee increases in our business;\n\u00b7\nBluegreen\u2019s ability to maintain, enhance or expand its marketing arrangements and relationships;\n\u00b7\nChanges in taxes and governmental regulations, including those that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;\n\u00b7\nCosts and efforts associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations, and the costs and consequences of non-compliance;\n\u00b7\nRisks related to the development or acquisition of resorts and inventory, including delays in, or cancellations of, planned or future resort development or inventory acquisition activities;\n\u00b7\nShortages of labor or labor disruptions;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and cost of capital necessary for Bluegreen and third-party developers with whom Bluegreen does business to fund investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations;\n\u00b7\nBluegreen\u2019s ability to securitize the receivables that it originates in connection with VOI sales;\n\u00b7\nFinancial condition of third-party developers with whom Bluegreen does business;\n\u00b7\nRelationships with third-party developers, Bluegreen\u2019s Vacation Club members and HOAs;\n\u00b7\nChanges in the supply and demand for Bluegreen\u2019s products and services;\n\u00b7\nLack of security over inappropriate access to customer or Bluegreen\u2019s records;\n\u00b7\nPrivate resales of VOIs and the sale of VOIs in the secondary market; and\n\u00b7\nUnlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale, cease and desist, or vacation package sales schemes, and reputational risk associated therewith.\n\ufeff\nAny of these factors could increase costs, limit or reduce the prices Bluegreen is able to charge for its products and services or adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s ability to develop or acquire new resorts or source VOI supply from third parties, or otherwise adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s business, prospects or results.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s business and operations, including its ability to market VOIs, may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and, conditions affecting the vacation ownership industry and the availability of financing.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s business is subject to risks related to general economic and industry conditions and trends. Bluegreen\u2019s results, operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and industry conditions, such as high unemployment rates and job insecurity, declines in discretionary spending, declines in real estate values and the occurrence of adverse weather or geopolitical conflicts, including if these or other factors adversely impact the availability of financing for Bluegreen or its customers or the ability of Bluegreen\u2019s customers\u2019 to otherwise pay amounts owed under notes receivable. Further, adverse changes affecting the vacation ownership industry, such as an oversupply of vacation ownership units, a reduction in demand for such units, changes in travel and other consumer preferences, demographic and vacation patterns, changes in governmental regulation of the industry, imposition of increased taxes by governmental authorities, the declaration of bankruptcy and/or credit defaults by other vacation ownership companies and negative publicity for the industry, could also have a material\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nadverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s business. This includes risks relating to conditions that negatively shape public perception of Bluegreen resorts or of travel or the vacation ownership or hospitality industry generally, including travel-related accidents, disease outbreaks, whether in regions generally, at third party properties or at Bluegreen resorts (including reputational damage, remediation costs and other potential liability and adverse impact of any such outbreak at Bluegreen resorts). Bluegreen\u2019s operations and results may be negatively impacted if Bluegreen is unable to update its business strategy over time and from time to time in response to changing economic and industry conditions.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen may not be able to develop or acquire VOI inventory or enter into and maintain fee-based service agreements or other arrangements to source VOI inventory, which may cause its business and results to be adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to developed VOI sales, Bluegreen sources VOIs as part of its capital-light business strategy through fee-based service agreements with third-party developers and through JIT and secondary market arrangements. If Bluegreen is unable to develop or acquire resorts at the levels or in the time frames anticipated, or is unsuccessful in entering into agreements with third-party developers or others to source VOI inventory in connection with its capital-light business strategy, Bluegreen may experience a decline in VOI supply or an increase in VOI cost, which could have a negative impact on Bluegreen\u2019s sales and results of operations. In addition, a decline in VOI supply and sales could result in a decrease in financing revenues that are generated by VOI sales and fee and rental revenues that are generated by Bluegreen\u2019s management services.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s business and properties are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. Changes in these laws, regulations and policies, as well as the cost of maintaining compliance with new or existing laws, regulations and policies and the imposition of additional taxes on operations, could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s business. In addition, results of audits of its tax returns or those of its subsidiaries may have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe federal government and the state and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen operates have enacted extensive regulations that affect the manner in which Bluegreen markets and sells VOIs and conduct its other business operations. In addition, federal, state and local regulators may enact new laws and regulations that may adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s results or require Bluegreen to substantially modify its business practices. Many states have adopted specific laws and regulations regarding the sale of VOIs. Many states, including Florida and South Carolina, where certain of Bluegreen resorts are located, extensively regulate VOI and timeshare related activities, including the creation and management of resorts, the marketing and sale of properties, the escrow of purchaser funds prior to the completion of construction and closing, the content and use of advertising materials and promotional offers, the delivery of an offering memorandum and the creation and operation of exchange programs and multi-site timeshare plan reservation systems. Moreover, with regard to sales conducted in South Carolina, the closing of real estate and mortgage loan transactions must be conducted under the supervision of an attorney licensed in South Carolina and otherwise in accordance with South Carolina\u2019s Timesharing Transaction Procedures Act. Most states also have other laws that are applicable to Bluegreen\u2019s activities, such as timeshare project registration laws, real estate licensure laws, mortgage licensure laws, sellers of travel licensure laws, anti-fraud laws, consumer protection laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and consumer credit laws. Bluegreen\u2019s management of, and dealings with, HOAs, including Bluegreen\u2019s purchase of defaulted inventory from HOAs in connection with its secondary market sales, are also subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making, and the imposition of maintenance assessments.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen is authorized to market and sell VOIs in all locations at which Bluegreen marketing and sales activities are conducted. If Bluegreen\u2019s agents or employees violate applicable regulations or licensing requirements, their acts or omissions could cause the states where the violations occurred to revoke or refuse to renew Bluegreen\u2019s licenses, render Bluegreen\u2019s sales contracts void or voidable, or impose fines on Bluegreen based on past activities.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the federal government and the state and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen conducts business have generally enacted extensive regulations relating to direct marketing and telemarketing, including the federal government\u2019s national \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the making of marketing and related calls to cell phone users, a significant development in light of cell phone usage becoming the primary method of communication, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. These regulations, as well as international data protection laws, have impacted Bluegreen\u2019s marketing of VOIs. While Bluegreen has taken steps designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, these steps have increased and are expected to continue to increase marketing costs and may not prevent failures in compliance. Additionally, adoption of new state or federal laws regulating marketing and solicitation, and changes to existing laws, could adversely affect current or planned\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmarketing activities and cause Bluegreen to change its marketing strategy. If this occurs, Bluegreen may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect the amount and timing of its VOI sales. Bluegreen cannot predict the impact that these legislative initiatives or any other legislative measures that may be proposed or enacted in the future may have on its marketing strategies and results. Further, from time to time, complaints are filed against Bluegreen by individuals claiming that they received calls in violation of applicable regulations. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d for description of litigation that was brought against Bluegreen in January 2019 relating to telemarketing sales activities.\n\ufeff\nMost states have taxed VOIs as real estate, imposing property taxes that are billed to the respective HOAs that maintain the related resorts, and have not sought to impose sales tax upon the sale of the VOI or accommodations tax upon the use of the VOI. From time to time, however, various states have attempted to promulgate new laws or apply existing laws impacting the taxation of VOIs to require that sales or accommodations taxes be collected. Should new state or local laws be implemented or interpreted to impose sales or accommodations taxes on VOIs, Bluegreen\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of its business, consumers file complaints against Bluegreen. Bluegreen may be required to incur significant costs to resolve these complaints or enter into consents with regulators regarding its activities, including the refund of all or a portion of the purchase price paid by the customer for the VOI. If Bluegreen is found to have not complied with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, such violations may have adverse implications on Bluegreen, including rendering Bluegreen\u2019s VOI sales contracts void or voidable, negative publicity, potential litigation, and regulatory fines or other sanctions. The expense, negative publicity and potential sanctions associated with any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s business, results of operations or financial position.\n\ufeff\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder (collectively, the \u201cADA\u201d), all public accommodations, including Bluegreen\u2019s properties, must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA\u2019s requirements could require removal of access barriers or other renovations, and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, or awards of damages, against Bluegreen. Bluegreen\u2019s properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. Further, various laws govern Bluegreen\u2019s resort management activities, including laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, and the environment (including climate change).\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s lending activities are also subject to a number of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection and credit reporting practices, consumer collection practices, contacting debtors by telephone, mortgage disclosure, lender licenses and money laundering. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, created under the Dodd-Frank Act, has emphasized new regulatory focus on areas of Bluegreen\u2019s business such as consumer mortgage servicing and debt collection, credit reporting and consumer financial disclosures, all of which affect the manner in which Bluegreen may provide financing to the purchasers of VOIs and conduct its lending and loan servicing operations.\n\ufeff\nThe vacation ownership and hospitality industries are highly competitive, and Bluegreen may not be able to compete successfully.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen competes with various high profile and well-established operators, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than Bluegreen. Many of the world\u2019s most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell timeshare units or VOIs in resort properties. Bluegreen also competes with numerous smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts and also faces competition from alternative lodging options available to consumers through both traditional methods of delivery as well as new web portals and applications, including private rentals of homes or apartments or condominium units, which have increased in popularity in recent years. Bluegreen's ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers depends on its customers' satisfaction with its products and services as well as on distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of its products and services from those offered by its competitors. Customer dissatisfaction with experiences at its resorts or otherwise as a Vacation Club owner, including due to an inability to use points for desired stays, could result in negative publicity and/or a decrease in sales, or otherwise adversely impact Bluegreen's ability to successfully compete in the vacation ownership and hospitality industries. Bluegreen may not be able to timely and sufficiently identify and remediate the cause of customer dissatisfaction. Any of these events could materially and adversely impact Bluegreen's operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBluegreen\u2019s business and profitability may be impacted if financing is not available on favorable terms, or at all.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with VOI sales, Bluegreen generally offers financing to the purchaser of up to 90% of the purchase price of the VOI. However, Bluegreen incurs selling, marketing and administrative cash expenses prior to and concurrent with the sale. These costs, along with the cost of the underlying VOI, generally exceed the down payment Bluegreen receives at the time of the sale. Accordingly, Bluegreen\u2019s ability to borrow against or sell its notes receivable has historically been a critical factor in Bluegreen\u2019s continued liquidity, and Bluegreen therefore has depended on funds from its credit facilities and securitization transactions to finance its operations. If Bluegreen\u2019s pledged receivables facilities terminate or expire and Bluegreen is unable to extend them or replace them with comparable facilities, or if Bluegreen is unable to continue to participate in securitization-type transactions and \u201cwarehouse\u201d facilities on acceptable terms, Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity, cash flow and profitability would be materially and adversely affected. Credit market disruptions have in the past adversely impacted the willingness of banks and other finance companies to provide \u201cwarehouse\u201d lines of credit for VOI notes receivable and resulted from time to time in the term securitization market being unavailable. Future credit market disruptions may have similar effects or otherwise make obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and more costly.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt is cyclical. While Bluegreen has increased its focus on expanding its fee-based service business and encouraging higher down payments in connection with sales, there is no assurance that these initiatives will enhance Bluegreen\u2019s financial position or otherwise be successful in the long term.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen anticipates that it will continue to seek and use external sources of liquidity, including borrowings under its existing credit facilities, under credit facilities that Bluegreen may obtain in the future, under securitizations in which Bluegreen may participate in the future or pursuant to other borrowing arrangements, to:\n\u00b7\nSupport Bluegreen\u2019s operations and, subject to declaration by its board of directors and contractual limitations, including limitations contained in its credit facilities, pay dividends;\n\u00b7\nFinance the acquisition and development of VOI inventory or property and equipment;\n\u00b7\nFinance a substantial percentage of Bluegreen\u2019s sales; and\n\u00b7\nSatisfy Bluegreen\u2019s debt and other obligations.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s ability to service or refinance its indebtedness or to obtain additional financing (including its ability to consummate future term securitizations) depends on the credit markets and on Bluegreen\u2019s future performance, which is subject to a number of factors, including the success of Bluegreen\u2019s business, results of operations, leverage, financial condition and business prospects, prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions, the performance of Bluegreen\u2019s receivables portfolio, and perceptions about the vacation ownership and real estate industries.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, Bluegreen had $29.1 million of indebtedness scheduled to become due during 2019. Historically, much of Bluegreen\u2019s debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. However, there is no assurance that Bluegreen will be able to renew, extend or refinance all or any portion of its outstanding debt or otherwise obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity, in each case, on attractive terms, or at all. If Bluegreen is unable to do so, Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity and financial condition may be materially, adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, Bluegreen has and intends to continue to enter into arrangements with third-party developers pursuant to which it will sell their VOI inventory for a fee. These arrangements enable Bluegreen to generate fees from the marketing and sales services provided, and in certain cases from provisions of management services, without requiring it to fund development and acquisition costs. If these third-party developers are not able to obtain or maintain financing necessary for their development activities or other operations, Bluegreen may not be able to enter into these fee-based arrangements or have access to their VOI inventory when anticipated, which would adversely impact results.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen would suffer substantial losses and its liquidity position could be adversely impacted if an increasing number of customers to whom Bluegreen provides financing default on their obligations.\n\ufeff\nAdverse conditions in the mortgage industry, including credit availability, borrowers\u2019 financial profiles, prepayment rates and other factors, including those outside of Bluegreen\u2019s control, may increase the default rates Bluegreen experiences or otherwise negatively impact the performance of its notes receivable. In addition, in recent years, third parties have been discouraging certain borrowers from staying current on their note payments. Although in many cases Bluegreen may have recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price, certain states have laws that limit Bluegreen\u2019s ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans or Bluegreen may determine that the cost of doing so may not be justified. Historically, Bluegreen has generally not pursued such\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrecourse against its customers. In the case of Bluegreen\u2019s notes receivable secured by VOIs, if Bluegreen is unable to collect the defaulted amount due, Bluegreen traditionally has terminated the customer\u2019s interest in the Bluegreen Vacation Club and then remarketed the recovered VOI. Irrespective of Bluegreen\u2019s remedy in the event of a default, Bluegreen cannot recover the marketing, selling and administrative costs associated with the original sale, and such costs generally exceed the cash received by Bluegreen from the buyer at the time of the sale. In addition, Bluegreen will need to incur such costs again in order to resell the VOI. Bluegreen updates its estimate of such future losses each quarter, and consequently, the charge against sales in a particular period may be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by a change in expected losses related to notes originated in prior periods. In addition, defaults may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are secured by, Bluegreen\u2019s VOI notes receivable to reduce the amount of availability or advance rates under receivables purchase and credit facilities, or result in an increase in the interest costs associated with such facilities. In such an event, the cost of financing may increase, and Bluegreen may not be able to secure replacement or alternative financing on terms acceptable to Bluegreen, if at all, which would adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s earnings, financial position and liquidity.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s VOI notes receivable financing facilities could be adversely affected if a particular VOI note receivable pool fails to meet certain performance ratios, which could occur if the default rate or other credit metrics of the underlying VOI notes receivable deteriorate. In addition, if Bluegreen offers financing to purchasers of VOIs with terms longer than those generally offered in the industry, Bluegreen may not be able to securitize those VOI financing receivables. Bluegreen\u2019s ability to sell securities backed by Bluegreen\u2019s VOI notes receivable depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities. Asset-backed securities issued in Bluegreen\u2019s term securitization transactions could be downgraded by credit agencies in the future. If a downgrade occurs, Bluegreen\u2019s ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all could be jeopardized, and Bluegreen could be forced to rely on other potentially more expensive and less attractive funding sources, to the extent available. Similarly, if other operators of vacation ownership products were to experience significant financial difficulties, or if the vacation ownership industry as a whole were to contract, Bluegreen could experience difficulty in securing funding on acceptable terms. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s business and results, including, without limitation, by reducing the amount of financing Bluegreen is able to provide to VOI purchasers, which in turn may result in a reduction in VOI sales.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, under the terms of Bluegreen\u2019s pledge and receivable sale facilities, Bluegreen may be required, under certain circumstances, to replace receivables or to pay down the loan to within permitted loan-to-value ratios. Additionally, the terms of Bluegreen\u2019s securitization transactions require Bluegreen to repurchase or replace loans if Bluegreen breaches any of the representations and warranties Bluegreen made at the time Bluegreen sold the receivables. These agreements also often include terms providing for substantially all of Bluegreen\u2019s cash flow from its retained interest in the receivable portfolios sold to be paid to the parties who purchased the receivables from Bluegreen in the event of defaults or delinquencies by customers in excess of stated thresholds, or if other performance thresholds are not met.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen's existing indebtedness, or indebtedness that it may incur in the future, could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of Bluegreen's indebtedness may limit its activities.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen's level of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on Bluegreen's operations. Significant debt service cash requirements reduce the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increase Bluegreen's vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, as well as conditions in the credit markets generally. In addition, Bluegreen's leverage position increases its vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures and may limit funds available for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and other general corporate purposes. Further, the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures, credit agreements and other agreements relating to Bluegreen's indebtedness require Bluegreen to meet certain financial tests and may limit its ability to, among other things, pay dividends, borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or make investments. If Bluegreen fails to comply with the terms of its debt instruments, such debt may become due and payable immediately, which would have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen's cash position and financial condition. Significant resources may be required to monitor Bluegreen's compliance with its debt instruments (from a quantitative and qualitative perspective), and such monitoring efforts may not be effective in all cases. Bluegreen may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to its current debt levels, the related risks that Bluegreen faces could intensify.\n\ufeff\nTo the extent inflationary trends, tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates, Bluegreen\u2019s debt service costs may increase. If interest rates increased one percentage point, the effect on interest expense related to Bluegreen\u2019s variable-rate debt would be an annual increase of $2.9 million, based on balances as of December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe ratings of third-party rating agencies could adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s ability to obtain, renew or extend credit facilities, or otherwise raise funds.\n\ufeff\nRating agencies from time to time review prior corporate and specific transaction ratings in light of tightened ratings criteria. In February 2019, Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services affirmed Bluegreen\u2019s \u2018B+\u2019 credit rating. Bluegreen\u2019s corporate credit rating is also based, in part, on rating agencies\u2019 speculation about Bluegreen\u2019s potential future debt and dividend levels. If rating agencies were to downgrade Bluegreen\u2019s corporate credit ratings, Bluegreen\u2019s ability to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, and Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. See \u201cBluegreen would suffer substantial losses and Bluegreen\u2019s liquidity position could be adversely impacted if an increasing number of customers to whom Bluegreen provides financing default on their obligations\u201d above. In addition, if rating agencies downgraded their original ratings on certain bond classes in Bluegreen\u2019s securitizations, holders of such bonds may be required to sell bonds in the marketplace, and such sales could occur at a discount, which could impact the perceived value of the bonds and Bluegreen\u2019s ability to sell future bonds on favorable terms or at all. While Bluegreen is not aware of any reasonably likely downgrades to its corporate credit rating or the ratings of bond classes in its securitizations, such ratings changes can occur without advance notice.\n\ufeff\nThere are risks associated with Bluegreen\u2019s maintenance and addition of strategic partnerships and arrangements.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen generates a significant portion of its new sales prospects and leads through its arrangements with various third parties, including Bass Pro and Choice Hotels, and is dependent upon existing and future relationships in order to acquire new customers. VOI sales to prospects and leads generated by Bluegreen\u2019s marketing arrangement with Bass Pro accounted for approximately 14% and 15% of Bluegreen\u2019s VOI sales volume during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If Bluegreen\u2019s agreement with Bass Pro, or any other significant marketing arrangement, does not generate a sufficient number of prospects and leads or is terminated or limited and not replaced by another source of sales prospects and leads, Bluegreen may not be able to successfully market and sell its products and services at current sales levels, at anticipated levels or at levels required in order to offset the costs associated with its marketing efforts. Bluegreen has continued to meet with Bass Pro\u2019s leadership in an effort to resolve the issues which arose between the parties in 2017 and 2018. While Bluegreen does not believe that any material additional amounts are due to Bass Pro, Bluegreen\u2019s future results would be impacted if the issues are not resolved and by any change in the compensation payable to Bass Pro or the calculation of payments or reimbursements utilized pursuant to the agreements.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s future success depends on its ability to market its products and services successfully and efficiently, and Bluegreen\u2019s marketing expenses have increased and may continue to increase in the future.\n\ufeff\nAs previously described, Bluegreen competes for customers with hotel and resort properties, other vacation ownership resorts and alternative lodging options, including private rentals of homes, apartments or condominium units. The identification of sales prospects and leads and the marketing of Bluegreen\u2019s products and services to them are essential to Bluegreen\u2019s success. Bluegreen incurs expenses associated with marketing programs in advance of the closing of sales. If Bluegreen\u2019s lead identification and marketing efforts do not yield enough leads or Bluegreen is unable to successfully convert sales leads to sales, Bluegreen may be unable to recover the expense of its marketing programs and systems and its business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. In addition, while sales to existing owners have increased recently, Bluegreen also continues to focus its marketing efforts on selling to new customers, which typically involves a relatively higher marketing cost compared to sales to existing owners. These efforts may result in increases in Bluegreen\u2019s sales and marketing expenses. If Bluegreen is not successful in offsetting the cost increase with greater sales revenue, Bluegreen\u2019s operating results and financial condition would be adversely impacted. In addition, Bluegreen's marketing efforts are subject to the risk of changing consumer behavior. Changes in consumer behavior may adversely impact the effectiveness of marketing efforts and strategies which Bluegreen has in place, and Bluegreen may not be able to timely and effectively respond to such changes. In addition, Bluegreen may not be able to continue to increase or maintain its level of sales to existing owners.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBluegreen may not be successful in maintaining or expanding its capital-light business relationships, or its capital-light activities, including fee-based sales and marketing arrangements, and JIT and secondary market sales activities, and such activities may not be profitable, which would have an adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen offers fee-based marketing, sales, resort management and other services to third-party developers. Bluegreen has over the last several years continued to expand its capital-light business strategy, which Bluegreen believes enables it to leverage its expertise in sales and marketing, resort management, mortgage servicing, construction management and title services. Bluegreen currently intends to continue its focus on its capital-light business activities as such activities generally produce positive cash flow and typically require less capital investment than Bluegreen\u2019s traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen has attempted to structure these activities to cover its costs and generate a profit. Sales of third party developers\u2019 VOIs must generate sufficient cash to comply with the terms of their financing obligations as well as to pay the fees or commissions due to Bluegreen. The third party developers may not be able to obtain or maintain financing necessary to meet the developer\u2019s requirements, which could impact Bluegreen's ability to sell the developers\u2019 inventory. While Bluegreen could attempt to utilize other arrangements, including JIT arrangements, where Bluegreen would utilize its receivable credit facilities in order to provide fee-based marketing and sales services, this would reduce the credit otherwise available to Bluegreen and impact profitability. Bluegreen commenced its capital-light activities largely during the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d in response to poor economic conditions, and Bluegreen\u2019s fee-based and other capital-light business activities in the future may be adversely impacted by changes in economic conditions. When Bluegreen performs fee-based sales and marketing services, Bluegreen sells VOIs in a resort developed by a third party as an interest in the Bluegreen Vacation Club. This subjects Bluegreen to a number of risks typically associated with selling products developed by others under its own brand name, including litigation risks. Further, these arrangements may expose Bluegreen to additional risk as it will not control development activities or timing of development completion. If third parties with whom Bluegreen enters into agreements are not able to fulfill their obligations to Bluegreen, the inventory expected to be acquired or marketed and sold on their behalf may not be available when expected or at all, or may not otherwise meet agreed-upon specifications. Further, if these third parties do not perform as expected and Bluegreen does not have access to the expected inventory or ability to obtain access to inventory from alternative sources on a timely basis, its ability to maintain or increase sales levels would be adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen also sells VOI inventory through secondary market arrangements which require low levels of capital deployment. In connection with secondary market sales, Bluegreen acquires VOI inventory from its resorts\u2019 HOAs on a non-committed basis in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. VOIs purchased from HOAs are typically obtained by the HOAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a discount. While Bluegreen intends to increase its secondary market sales efforts in the future, Bluegreen may not be successful in doing so, and these efforts may not result in Bluegreen achieving anticipated results. Further, Bluegreen\u2019s secondary market sale activities may subject Bluegreen to negative publicity, which could adversely impact its reputation and business.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen is subject to certain risks associated with its management of resort properties.\n\ufeff\nThrough management of resorts and ownership of VOIs, Bluegreen is subject to certain risks related to the physical condition and operation of the managed resort properties in its network, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nThe presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage at any of these resorts, including resorts Bluegreen may develop in the future;\n\u00b7\nAny noncompliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements relating to these resorts;\n\u00b7\nAny damage or interruption of access to physical assets resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms, which may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change or other factors; and\n\u00b7\nClaims by employees, members and their guests for injuries sustained on these resort properties.\n\ufeff\nSome of these risks may be more significant in connection with the properties for which Bluegreen recently acquired management agreements, particularly those management agreements which were acquired from operators in financial distress. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs as a result of any of the foregoing, Bluegreen may be subject to significant costs.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdditionally, a number of U.S. federal, state and local laws, including the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the ADA, impose requirements related to access to and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities. A determination that managed resorts are subject to, and that they are not in compliance with, these accessibility laws could result in a judicial order requiring compliance, imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. If one of Bluegreen\u2019s managed resorts was required to make significant improvements as a result of non-compliance with these accessibility laws, assessments might be needed to fund such improvements, which additional costs may cause its VOI owners to default on their consumer loans from Bluegreen or cease making required maintenance fee or assessment payments. Also, to the extent that Bluegreen holds interests in a particular resort, it would be responsible for the pro rata share of the costs of such improvements. In addition, any new legislation may impose further burdens or restrictions on property owners with respect to access by disabled persons.\n\ufeff\nThe resort properties that Bluegreen manages are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and worker health and safety, including laws and regulations governing and creating liability relating to the management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and other regulated materials and the cleanup of contaminated sites. The resorts are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern certain aspects of their ongoing operations. These laws and regulations control such things as the nature and volume of wastewater discharges, quality of water supply and waste management practices. To the extent that Bluegreen holds interests in a particular resort, it would be responsible for the pro rata share of losses sustained by such resort as a result of a violation of any such laws and regulations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, Bluegreen may from time to time have disagreements with VOI owners and HOAs resulting from its provision of management services. Failure to resolve such disagreements may result in litigation and additional costs. Further, disagreements with HOAs could also result in the loss of management contracts, which would negatively affect Bluegreen\u2019s revenues and results and may also have an adverse impact on its ability to generate sales from existing VOI owners.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s management contracts are typically structured as \u201ccost-plus,\u201d with an initial term of three years and automatic one-year renewals. If a management contract is terminated or not renewed on favorable terms or is renegotiated in a manner adverse to Bluegreen, its revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted if Bluegreen does not continue to participate in exchange networks and other strategic alliances with third parties or if Bluegreen customers are not satisfied with the networks in which Bluegreen participate or our strategic alliances.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen believes that its participation in exchange networks and other strategic alliances and its Traveler Plus program make ownership of its VOIs more attractive by providing owners with the ability to take advantage of vacation experiences in addition to stays at Bluegreen resorts. Bluegreen\u2019s participation in the RCI exchange network allows Vacation Club owners to use their points to stay at over 4,300 participating resorts, based upon availability and the payment of a variable exchange fee. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 8% of Vacation Club owners utilized the RCI exchange network for a stay of two or more nights. Bluegreen also has an exclusive strategic arrangement with Choice Hotels pursuant to which, subject to payments and conditions, certain of Bluegreen resorts have been branded as part of Choice Hotels\u2019 Ascend Hotel Collection. Vacation Club owners can convert their Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges points. Choice Privileges points can be used for stays at Choice Hotels. For a nominal annual fee and transactional fees, Vacation Club owners may also participate in Bluegreen\u2019s Traveler Plus program, which enables them to use points to access an additional 48 direct exchange resorts and for other vacation experiences such as cruises. In addition, Traveler Plus members can directly use their Vacation Club points for stays at Choice Hotels\u2019 Ascend Hotel Collection properties, a network of historic and boutique hotels in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and Latin America. Bluegreen may not be able to or desire to continue to participate in the RCI or direct exchange networks in the future or maintain or extend its other marketing and strategic networks, alliances and relationships. In addition, these networks, alliances and relationships, and Bluegreen\u2019s Traveler Plus program, may not continue to operate effectively, and Bluegreen customers may not be satisfied with them. In addition, Bluegreen may not be successful in identifying or entering into new strategic relationships in the future. If any of these events should occur, Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nMaintenance fees at Bluegreen\u2019s resorts and/or Vacation Club dues may be required to be increased, which could cause its product to become less attractive and could harm business.\n\ufeff\nThe maintenance fees, special assessments and Vacation Club dues that are levied by HOAs and the Vacation Club on VOI owners may increase as the costs to maintain and refurbish properties, and to keep properties in compliance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwith Bluegreen\u2019s standards and applicable regulations, increase. Increases in such fees, assessments or dues could negatively affect customer satisfaction with Bluegreen\u2019s Vacation Club or otherwise adversely impact VOI sales to both new customers and existing VOI owners or could contribute to additional defaults.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s strategic transactions may not be successful and may divert its management\u2019s attention and consume significant resources.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen intends to continue its strategy of selectively pursuing complementary strategic transactions. Bluegreen may also purchase management contracts, including from resort operators facing financial distress, and purchase VOI inventory at resorts that it does not manage, with the goal of acquiring sufficient VOI ownership at such a resort to become the manager of that resort. The successful execution of this strategy will depend on Bluegreen\u2019s ability to identify and enter into the agreements necessary to take advantage of these potential opportunities, and to obtain any necessary financing. Bluegreen may not be able to do so successfully. In addition, Bluegreen\u2019s management may be required to devote substantial time and resources to pursue these opportunities, which may impact their ability to manage its operations effectively.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions involve numerous additional risks, including: (i) difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business or assets; (ii) potential disruption of ongoing business and the distraction of management from day-to-day operations; (iii) difficulty entering markets in which Bluegreen has limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position; (iv) difficulty maintaining the quality of services that Bluegreen has historically provided across new acquisitions; (v) potential legal and financial responsibility for liabilities of the acquired business or assets; (vi) potential overpayment for the acquired business or assets; (vii) increased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets; (viii) risks associated with any debt incurred in connection with the financing of the transaction; and (ix) challenges in implementing uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen is dependent on the managers of its affiliated resorts to ensure that those properties meet its customers\u2019 expectations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to stays at Bluegreen resorts, Vacation Club owners have access to other resorts and hotels as a result of participation in exchange programs and other strategic alliances. Accordingly, Vacation Club owners have access to resorts that Bluegreen does not manage, own or operate. If those resorts are not maintained in a manner consistent with Bluegreen\u2019s standards of quality, or Bluegreen\u2019s Vacation Club owners are otherwise dissatisfied with those resorts, Bluegreen may be subject to customer complaints and its reputation and brand could be damaged. In addition, Bluegreen\u2019s agreements with these resorts or their owners may expire, be terminated or not be renewed, or may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to Bluegreen, and Bluegreen may be unable to enter into new agreements that provide Vacation Club owners with equivalent access to additional resorts, any or all of which could materially adversely impact Bluegreen\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe resale market for VOIs could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\nBased on Bluegreen\u2019s experience at its resorts and at resorts owned by third parties, Bluegreen believes that resales of VOIs in the secondary market generally are made at net sales prices below the original customer purchase prices. The relatively lower sales prices are partly attributable to the high marketing and sales costs associated with the initial sales of such VOIs. Accordingly, the initial purchase price of a VOI may be less attractive to prospective buyers, and Bluegreen competes with buyers who seek to resell their VOIs. While VOI resale clearing houses or brokers currently do not have a material impact on Bluegreen\u2019s business, the availability of resale VOIs at lower prices, particularly if an organized and liquid secondary market develops, could adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s level of sales and sales prices, which in turn would adversely affect Bluegreen\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen is subject to the risks of the real estate market and the risks associated with real estate development, including a decline in real estate values and a deterioration of other conditions relating to the real estate market and real estate development.\n\ufeff\nReal estate markets are cyclical in nature and highly sensitive to changes in national and regional economic conditions, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nLevels of unemployment;\n\u00b7\nLevels of discretionary disposable income;\n\u00b7\nLevels of consumer confidence;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nThe availability of financing;\n\u00b7\nOverbuilding or decreases in demand;\n\u00b7\nInterest rates; and\n\u00b7\nFederal, state and local taxation methods.\n\ufeff\nA deterioration in general economic conditions or in the real estate market would have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen expects to seek to acquire more real estate inventory in the future, and the availability of land for development of resort properties at favorable prices will be critical to Bluegreen\u2019s profitability and the ability to cover its significant selling, general and administrative expenses, cost of capital and other expenses. If Bluegreen is unable to acquire such land or resort properties at a favorable cost, Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations may be materially, adversely impacted. The profitability of Bluegreen\u2019s real estate development activities is also impacted by the cost of construction, including the costs of materials and labor and other services. Should the cost of construction materials and services rise, the ultimate cost of Bluegreen\u2019s future resorts inventory when developed could increase and have a material, adverse impact on Bluegreen\u2019s results of operations. Bluegreen is also exposed to other risks associated with development activities, including, without limitation:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nAdverse conditions in the capital markets may limit Bluegreen\u2019s ability to raise capital for completion of projects or for development of future properties;\n\u00b7\nConstruction delays, zoning and other local, state or federal governmental approvals, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions and oil spills, increasing overall construction costs, affecting timing of project completion or resulting in project cancellations;\n\u00b7\nAny liability or alleged liability or resulting delays associated with latent defects in design or construction of projects Bluegreen has developed or that Bluegreen constructs in the future adversely affecting Bluegreen\u2019s business, financial condition and reputation;\n\u00b7\nFailure by third-party contractors to perform for any reason, exposing Bluegreen to operational, reputational and financial harm; and\n\u00b7\nThe existence of any title defects in properties Bluegreen acquires.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the third-party developers from whom Bluegreen sources VOI inventory as part of its capital-light business strategy are exposed to such development-related risks and, therefore, the occurrence of such risks may adversely impact its ability to acquire VOI inventory from them when expected or at all.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s intellectual property rights, and the intellectual property rights of its business partners, are valuable, and the failure to protect those rights could adversely affect its business.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen\u2019s intellectual property rights, including existing and future trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights, are and will continue to be valuable and important assets of its business. Bluegreen believes that its proprietary technology, as well as its other technologies and business practices, are competitive advantages and that any duplication by competitors would harm Bluegreen\u2019s business. Measures taken to protect Bluegreen\u2019s intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. Additionally, intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions may not prevent misappropriation of Bluegreen\u2019s intellectual property. Finally, even if Bluegreen is able to successfully protect its intellectual property, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to Bluegreen\u2019s technology. Bluegreen also generates a significant portion of new sales prospects and leads through arrangements with third parties, including Bass Pro. The failure by these third parties to protect their intellectual property rights could also harm Bluegreen\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital Real Estate\n\ufeff\nSome of BBXRE\u2019s operations are through unconsolidated joint ventures with others, and we may be adversely impacted by a joint venture partner\u2019s failure to fulfill its obligations.\n\ufeff\nBy entering into joint ventures, BBXRE may be successful in reducing the amount BBXRE invests in the ownership and development of real estate properties. However, joint venture partners may become financially unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture agreements. Most joint ventures borrow money to help finance their activities, and although recourse on the loans is generally limited to the managing members, joint ventures and their properties, BBXRE has in some cases and may in the future provide ongoing financial support or guarantees. If joint\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nventure partners do not meet their obligations to the joint venture, BBXRE may be required to make significant expenditures, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. BBXRE has in the past and may in the future hold investments in a number of different joint ventures with the same or related developers, which could increase the adverse effects of any failures by such developer to fulfil its obligations. BBXRE has a substantial investment in the Altman Companies and related investments in Altis multifamily apartment joint ventures developed and managed by Altman Companies and Joel Altman (\u201cJA\u201d). Additionally, BBXRE has contributed $2.5 million to a newly formed joint venture with JA that guarantees the indebtedness and construction cost overruns of new real estate joint ventures established by Altman Companies, which increases BBXRE\u2019s risk of loss in connection with its real estate joint venture investments managed by JA and the Altman Companies.\n\ufeff\nInvestments by BBXRE in real estate developments directly or through joint ventures expose it to market and economic risks inherent in the real estate construction and development industry.\n\ufeff\nThe real estate construction and development industry is highly competitive and subject to numerous risks which in many cases are beyond management\u2019s control. The success of BBXRE\u2019s investments in real estate developments is dependent on many factors, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nDemand for or oversupply of new homes, finished lots, rental apartments and commercial real estate;\n\u00b7\nDemand for commercial real estate tenants;\n\u00b7\nReal estate market values;\n\u00b7\nChanges in capitalization rates impacting real estate values;\n\u00b7\nInventory of foreclosed homes negatively impacting selling prices;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and reasonable pricing of skilled labor;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and reasonable pricing of construction materials, such as lumber, framing, concrete and other building materials;\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws and regulations for new construction and land entitlements, including environmental and zoning laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nNatural disasters and severe weather conditions increasing costs, delaying construction, causing uninsured losses or reducing demand for new homes;\n\u00b7\nAvailability and cost of mortgage financing for potential purchasers;\n\u00b7\nMortgage loan interest rates;\n\u00b7\nAvailability, delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, approvals or licenses necessary to develop property;\n\u00b7\nConstruction defects and product liability claims; and\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nAny of these factors could give rise to delays in the start or completion of a project, increase the cost of developing a project, or could result in reduced prices and values for BBX Capital\u2019s developments, including developments underlying its joint venture investments.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of BBXRE\u2019s loans and real estate assets are located in Florida, and economic conditions in the Florida real estate market could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe legacy assets retained by us in the BankAtlantic Sale, the real estate developments managed by BBXRE, and the real estate being developed by joint ventures in which BBXRE has invested are primarily concentrated in Florida, and adverse changes to the Florida economy or the real estate market may negatively impact our earnings and financial condition. As a result, BBXRE is exposed to geographic risks of high unemployment rates, declines in the housing industry and declines in the real estate market in Florida. Adverse changes in laws and regulations in Florida would have a negative impact on our revenues, financial condition and business. Declines in the Florida housing markets may negatively impact the credit performance of BBXRE\u2019s loans and result in asset impairments. Further, the State of Florida is subject to the risks of natural disasters, such as tropical storms and hurricanes, which may disrupt operations, adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans, adversely impact the value of any collateral securing loans and BBXRE\u2019s portfolio of real estate, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The severity and impact of tropical storms, hurricanes and other weather related events are unpredictable.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBXRE\u2019s inability to finance its real estate developments through Community Development District Bonds or obtain performance bonds or letters of credit could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\n\ufeff\nBBXRE is often required to provide performance bonds and letters of credit under construction contracts or development agreements. BBXRE also obtained financing for the construction of infrastructure improvements for the first two phases of its Beacon Lake development in St. Johns County, Florida from the issuance of Community Development Bonds. BBXRE\u2019s ability to obtain performance bonds, letters of credit, or additional issuances of Community Development Bonds is dependent on BBXRE\u2019s credit rating, financial condition, and historical performance. If BBXRE is unable to obtain these bonds or letters of credit or cause the issuance of Community Development Bonds when required or desirable, our results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nIn connection with the sale of BankAtlantic to BB&T during July 2012, we acquired nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if these assets are monetized below their current book values.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of the BankAtlantic Sale, we maintain and manage a portfolio of foreclosed real estate and non-performing loans managed by BBXRE. As a consequence, our financial condition and results of operations will be dependent on BBXRE\u2019s ability to successfully manage and monetize these legacy assets. Further, the loan portfolio and real estate may not be easily salable in the event BBXRE decides to liquidate an asset through a sale transaction. If the legacy assets are not monetized at or near the current book values ascribed to them, or if these assets are liquidated for amounts less than book value, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Because a majority of these legacy assets do not generate income on a regular basis, we do not expect to generate significant revenue or income with respect to these assets until such time as an asset is monetized through repayments or BBXRE consummate transactions involving the sale, joint venture or development of the underlying real estate or investments.\n\ufeff\nRenin\n\ufeff\nRenin\u2019s retail sales are concentrated with big-box home center customers, and there is significant competition in the industry.\n\ufeff\nA significant amount of Renin\u2019s sales are to big-box home centers. These home centers in many instances have significant negotiating leverage with their vendors, including Renin, and are able to affect the prices of the products sold and the terms and conditions of conducting business with them. These home centers may also reduce the number of vendors they purchase from or make significant changes in their volume of purchases. Although homebuilders, dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for Renin\u2019s products, the loss of a home center customer or reduced sales volume at any of these home centers would have a material adverse effect on Renin\u2019s business. Further, Renin has substantial competition from overseas manufacturers of products similar to those sold by Renin.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of Renin\u2019s business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity, both of which are cyclical and outside of management\u2019s control.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of Renin\u2019s business is dependent on the levels of home improvement activity, including spending on repair and remodeling projects, and new home construction activity. Macroeconomic conditions, including consumer confidence levels, fluctuations in home prices, unemployment and underemployment levels, interest rates, regulatory initiatives, and the availability of home equity loans and mortgage financing affect both discretionary spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity. Adverse changes in these factors or uncertainty regarding these macroeconomic conditions could result in a decline in spending on home improvement projects and a decline in demand for new home construction, both of which could adversely affect Renin\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRenin\u2019s operating results would be negatively impacted if it experiences increased commodity costs or a limited availability of commodities.\n\ufeff\nRenin purchases various commodities to manufacture products, including steel, aluminum, glass and mirrors. Fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase the cost to manufacture products. Further, increases in energy costs could increase production and transportation costs, each of which could negatively affect its operating results. Renin\u2019s existing arrangements with customers, competitive considerations and the relative negotiating power and resistance of home center customers and big-box retailers to price increases make it difficult to increase selling prices to absorb increased production costs. If Renin is not able to increase the prices of its products\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nor achieve other cost savings or productivity improvements to offset any increased commodity and production costs, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Many of the raw materials purchased by Renin are sourced from China, Mexico, and other countries. Changes in United States trade practices, or tariffs levied on these imports, could significantly impact Renin\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nIT'SUGAR and Other Confectionery Businesses\n\ufeff\nMarket demand for candy products could decline.\n\ufeff\nIT\u2019SUGAR and the Company\u2019s other confectionery businesses operate in highly competitive markets and compete with larger companies that have greater resources. IT\u2019SUGAR\u2019s success is impacted by many factors, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nEffective retail execution;\n\u00b7\nEffective and cost-efficient advertising campaigns and marketing programs;\n\u00b7\nAdequate supply of commodities at a reasonable cost;\n\u00b7\nOversight of product safety;\n\u00b7\nAbility to sell products at competitive prices;\n\u00b7\nResponse to changes in consumer preferences and tastes;\n\u00b7\nChanges in consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients and;\n\u00b7\nConcerns related to effects of sugar or other ingredients which may be used to make its products.\n\ufeff\nA decline in market demand for candy products could negatively affect operating results.\n\ufeff\nIT\u2019SUGAR\u2019s opening of new stores in high profile locations may reduce earnings, require additional financing and increase capital expenditures.\n\ufeff\nIT\u2019SUGAR\u2019s business strategy is to open new stores in high profile locations. While IT\u2019SUGAR seeks new store locations to provide opportunities for growth and earnings, IT\u2019SUGAR may not be successful in identifying these opportunities or may open new stores which are not profitable. The expansion of stores could expose IT\u2019SUGAR to additional debt financing, may not generate anticipated results, or may result in losses or future impairments, which can have an adverse effect on its results of operations and liquidity.\n\ufeff\nIT\u2019SUGAR\u2019s continued success is dependent on its ability to differentiate itself from other retailers in the confectionery industry.\n\ufeff\nIT\u2019SUGAR in the past has differentiated itself from other retailers through merchandise packaging, licenses, store environment, and celebrity endorsements. IT\u2019SUGAR\u2019s results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if it is unable to obtain celebrity endorsements or licenses at a reasonable cost or to maintain its distinct appeal or if actions by its competitors reduce the effectiveness of its business model.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital may experience product recalls or product liability claims associated with businesses in the confectionery industry.\n\ufeff\nSelling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. BBX Capital could decide or be required to destroy inventory, recall products or lose sales in connection with contamination, tampering, adulteration or other deficiencies. These events could result in significant losses and may damage BBX Capital\u2019s reputation, and discourage consumers from buying products, or cause production and delivery disruptions which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. BBX Capital may also incur losses if products cause injury, illness or death. A significant product liability claim may adversely affect both reputation and profitability, even if the claim is unsuccessful.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBBX Capital may not realize the expected results from its strategic initiatives in connection with companies acquired in the confectionery industry.\n\ufeff\nDuring 2018 and 2017, BBX Capital exited its candy manufacturing facilities in Utah and South Florida and consolidated its wholesale manufacturing operations in Orlando in order to improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. These strategic initiatives may not be successful, and BBX Capital may decide to otherwise exit these operations, which could result in additional losses and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOther Investments\n\ufeff\nFFTRG\u2019s operations require ongoing compliance with its area development and franchise agreements with MOD Pizza.\n\ufeff\nFFTRG\u2019s area development agreement with MOD Pizza provides an exclusive right to open MOD Pizza franchised pizza restaurant locations in the State of Florida subject to the requirement that FFTRG open restaurant locations based on a predetermined development schedule. Failure to comply with the schedule gives MOD Pizza the right to terminate the agreement. In connection with such a termination, FFTRG will lose its right to open additional MOD Pizza restaurant locations, and MOD Pizza may grant franchise rights to another franchisee in the state of Florida. If FFTRG loses its exclusive development rights, it will be unable to scale its infrastructure and operations, and its existing locations may face increased competition from additional MOD Pizza locations.\n\ufeff\nThe franchise agreements with MOD Pizza also require FFTRG to comply with various operating programs designed and established by MOD Pizza. These programs include the adoption of price discounts and promotions, the implementation of menu changes, and the funding of various ongoing operating expenses and capital expenditures, including the requirement to periodically remodel restaurant locations. These requirements and the related risks of noncompliance and the costs of compliance could have an adverse effect on the operating results of the Company\u2019s MOD Pizza franchise operations.\n\ufeff\nOther Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital or its subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital and its subsidiaries have in the past and may in the future incur significant amounts of debt, including at Bluegreen. Any indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in the future could have several important effects on BBX Capital or its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, that BBX Capital or its subsidiaries may be required to use available cash for the payment of principal and interest due on its debt and that the outstanding indebtedness and leverage at BBX Capital or its subsidiaries will impact liquidity, and any negative changes in general economic and industry conditions will increase such impact.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s technology requires updating, the cost involved in updating the technology may be significant, and the failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair the Company's operations or competitive position.\n\ufeff\nThe industries in which the Company does business, including the vacation ownership and hospitality industries, require the utilization of technology and systems, including technology utilized for sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, property management, brand assurance and compliance, and reservation systems. This technology requires continuous updating and refinements, including technology required to remain competitive and to comply with the legal requirements such as privacy regulations and requirements established by third parties. The Company is taking steps to update its information technology platform, which has required, and is likely to continue to require, significant capital expenditures. Older systems which have not yet been updated may increase the risk of operational inefficiencies, financial loss and non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and the Company may not be successful in updating such systems in the time frame or at the cost anticipated. Further, as a result of the rapidly changing technological environment, systems which the Company has put in place or expects to put in place in the near term may become outdated, requiring new technology, and the Company may not be able to replace those systems as quickly as its competition or within budgeted costs and time frames. Further, the Company may not achieve the benefits that may have been anticipated from any new technology or system.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, conversions to new information technology systems require effective change management processes and may result in cost overruns, delays or business interruptions. If the Company\u2019s information technology systems are\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndisrupted, become obsolete, or do not adequately support our strategic, operational, or compliance needs, the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital and its subsidiaries rely on information technology (IT) systems, including Internet sites, data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties. These IT systems, like those of most companies, may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions and risks, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, hackers, and other security issues. Moreover, the Company\u2019s computer systems, like those of most companies, may become subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, and to cyber or phishing-attacks. Although administrative and technical controls have been implemented which attempt to minimize the risk of cyber incidents, computer intrusion efforts are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and any enhanced controls installed might be breached. If the IT systems cease to function properly, the Company could suffer interruptions in its operations. If the cyber-security is breached, unauthorized persons may gain access to our proprietary or confidential information, including information about borrowers, employees or investments. This could require the Company to incur significant costs to comply with legally required protocols and to repair or restore the security of its systems.\n\ufeff\nThe tax impact resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are based on interpretations and assumptions the Company has made. Any changes in interpretations and assumptions or the issuance of additional regulatory guidance may have a material adverse impact on our tax rate in fiscal years 2018 and beyond.\n\ufeff\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Reform Act is complex, and the Company has made judgments and interpretations about the application of these changes in the tax laws. The interpretation and finalization of recently proposed regulations and other interpretive guidance that may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service could differ from our interpretations of the Tax Reform Act which could result in the potential for the payment of additional taxes, penalties or interest that may adversely affect our results of operations for the fiscal years 2019 and beyond.\n\ufeff\nUnexpected events, such as natural disasters, severe weather and terrorist activities, may disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and increase our costs.\n\ufeff\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather or terrorist activities in countries or regions in which our assets, suppliers or our operating businesses are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s insurance policies may not cover all potential losses.\n\ufeff\nThe Company maintains insurance coverage for liability, property and other risks with respect to its operations and activities. While the Company has comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that it believes are customary, market forces beyond the Company\u2019s control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage it can obtain or ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. The cost of insurance may increase and coverage levels may decrease, which may affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain customary insurance coverage and deductibles at acceptable costs. There is a limit as well as various sub-limits on the amount of insurance proceeds the Company will receive in excess of applicable deductibles. Further, certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, terrorist acts, and certain environmental matters, may be outside the general coverage limits of the Company\u2019s policies, subject to large deductibles, deemed uninsurable or too cost-prohibitive to justify insuring against. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage the Company carries may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of the affected property or in some cases may not provide a recovery for any part of a loss.\n\ufeff\nIf an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of the Company\u2019s properties, the claims from each affected property may be considered together to determine whether the individual occurrence limit, annual aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. If the limits or sub-limits are exceeded, each affected property may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy. As a result, the Company could lose some or all of the capital it has invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue opportunities from the property. Further, the Company could remain obligated under guarantees or other financial obligations related to a property. In addition, with respect to Bluegreen, its VOI owners could be required to contribute toward deductibles to help cover losses.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nAdverse outcomes in legal or other regulatory proceedings, including claims of non-compliance with applicable regulations or development-related defects could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which result in significant expenses and devotion of time and the Company may agree to indemnify third parties or its strategic partners from damages or losses associated with such risks. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes in the litigation and other proceedings to which the Company is or may be subject could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nBluegreen engages third-party contractors to construct its resorts, and BBXRE engages third-party contractors in its developments. However, Bluegreen\u2019s and BBXRE\u2019s respective customers may assert claims against Bluegreen and BBXRE for construction defects or other perceived development defects, including, without limitation, structural integrity, the presence of mold as a result of leaks or other defects, water intrusion, asbestos, electrical issues, plumbing issues, road construction, water and sewer defects and defects in the engineering of amenities. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to development defects discovered in the future. Bluegreen and BBXRE could have to accrue a significant portion of the cost to repair such defects in the quarter when such defects arise or when the repair costs are reasonably estimable.\n\ufeff\nCosts associated with litigation, including claims for development-related defects, and the outcomes thereof could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nBBX Capital and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws related to their real estate and timeshare activities including claims with respect to mold or hazardous or toxic substances, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nAs current or previous owners or operators of real property, BBX Capital and its subsidiaries, including Bluegreen, may be liable under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in the property. These laws often impose liability whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow money using such real estate or receivables generated from the sale of such property as collateral. Noncompliance with environmental, health or safety requirements may require us to cease or alter operations at one or more of our properties. Further, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with one or more of our properties. The cost of investigating, remediating or removing such hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial.\n\ufeff\nFailure to maintain the integrity of the Company\u2019s internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions or operational inefficiencies, damage the Company's reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines, or lawsuits.\n\ufeff\nThe Company collects and retains large volumes of internal and customer data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of its customers in various internal information systems and information systems of its service providers. The Company also maintains personally identifiable information about its employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to the Company and faulty decisions could be made if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. The Company\u2019s customers and employees also have a high expectation that the Company and its service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment as well as the requirements imposed on the Company by the payment card industry surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company\u2019s systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory and payment card industry requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s information systems and records, including those it maintains with its service providers, may be subject to security breaches, cyberattacks, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data maintained by the Company or by a service provider could adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines or litigation. A breach in the security of the Company\u2019s information systems or those of its service providers\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncould lead to an interruption in the operation of the Company\u2019s systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely impacted by negative publicity, including information spread through social media.\n\ufeff\nThe proliferation and global reach of social media continues to expand rapidly and could cause the Company to suffer reputational harm. The continuing evolution of social media presents new challenges and requires the Company to keep pace with new developments, technology and trends. Negative posts or comments about the Company, the properties it manages or its brands on any social networking or user-generated review website, including travel and vacation property websites, could affect consumer opinions of the Company and its products, and the Company cannot guarantee that it will timely or adequately redress such instances.\n\ufeff\nThe loss of the services of key management and personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy will depend on the ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff. If the Company is unable to retain and motivate its existing employees and efforts to retain and attract key management and other personnel are unsuccessful, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\n\ufeff\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the regulatory authority over LIBOR) stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rate indices after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternate reference rate. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for promissory notes or other contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. The Company currently has $177.1 million of LIBOR indexed junior subordinated debentures and $59.0 million of LIBOR indexed receivable-backed notes payable and lines of credit that mature after 2021. The Company is evaluating the potential impact that the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could have on the Company\u2019s results of operations and liquidity.\n\ufeff\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the SEC, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the amortization/accretion of purchase accounting fair value differences and the impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are often not readily apparent from other sources. However, estimates, judgments and assumptions can be highly uncertain and are subject to change in the future, and our estimates, judgments and assumptions may prove to be incorrect and our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, or our actual results differ from our estimates or assumptions, we may be required to record additional expenses or impairment charges, which would be recorded as a charge against our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t \t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 89735, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BBX"}
