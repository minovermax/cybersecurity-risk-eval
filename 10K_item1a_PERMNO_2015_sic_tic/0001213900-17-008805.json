{"cik": "98338", "company": "TSR INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-08-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain statements contained in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cBusiness\u201d, including statements concerning the Company\u2019s future prospects and the Company\u2019s future cash flow requirements are forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projections in the forward-looking statements, which statements involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the factors set forth below.\nDependence Upon Key Personnel\nJoseph F. Hughes, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President and Treasurer, retired on July 5, 2017. The Board of Directors of the Company has elected Christopher Hughes, formerly Senior Vice President of TSR, Inc., to succeed Joseph F. Hughes as Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President and Treasurer. The Company is dependent on Christopher Hughes in his corporate positions and as President of TSR Consulting Services, Inc. The Company has an employment agreement with Christopher Hughes which expires May 31, 2022. The Company is also dependent on certain of its account executives who are responsible for servicing its principal customers and attracting new customers. The Company does not have employment contracts with these persons. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain its existing personnel or find and attract additional qualified employees. The loss of the service of any of these personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nDependence on Significant Customers\nIn the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, the Company\u2019s three largest customers, Citigroup, Pontoon and Consolidated Edison, accounted for 19.4%, 12.9%, and 12.6% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue, respectively. Pontoon is a vendor management company through which the Company provides services to six end customers, of which Bristol Myers Squibb is the most significant, representing 8.7% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue for fiscal 2017. In total, the Company derives over 33% of its revenue from accounts with vendor management companies. The Company\u2019s ten largest customers provided 82% of consolidated revenue in fiscal 2017. Client contract terms vary depending on the nature of the engagement, and there can be no assurance that a client will renew a contract when it terminates. In addition, the Company\u2019s contracts are generally cancelable by the client at any time on short notice, and customers may unilaterally reduce their use of the Company\u2019s services under such contracts without penalty. Approximately 33% of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived from end customers in the financial services business. Continuing economic pressures in financial services have negatively affected the net effective rates that the Company charges to certain end customers in this industry, which has negatively affected the Company\u2019s gross profit margins. See \u201cRapidly Changing Industry\u201d below.\nThe accounts receivable balances associated with the Company\u2019s largest customers were $3,340,000 for three customers at May 31, 2017 and $3,735,000 for four customers at May 31, 2016. Because of the significant amount of outstanding receivables that the Company may have with its larger customers at any one time, if a client, including a vendor management company which then contracts with the ultimate client, filed for bankruptcy protection, it could prevent the Company from collecting on the receivables and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nDependence on Reputation\nThe Company\u2019s reputation among its customers, potential customers and the staffing services industry depends on the performance of the technical personnel that the Company places with its customers. If the Company\u2019s customers are not satisfied with the services provided by the technical personnel placed by the Company, or if the technical personnel placed by the Company lack the qualifications or experience necessary to perform the services required by the Company\u2019s customers, the Company may not be able to successfully maintain its relationships with its customers or expand its client base.\nCompetitive Market for Technical Personnel\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified computer professionals to provide as temporary personnel to its customers. Competition for the limited number of qualified professionals with a working knowledge of certain sophisticated computer languages, which the Company requires for its contract computer services business, is intense. The Company believes that there is a shortage of, and significant competition for, software professionals with the skills and experience necessary to perform the services offered by the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business in its contract computer programming business depends, in large part, on its ability to hire and retain technical personnel with the IT skills that keep pace with continuing changes in software evolution, industry standards and technologies, and client preferences. Although the Company generally has been successful in attracting employees with the skills needed to fulfill customer engagements, demand for qualified professionals conversant with certain technologies may outstrip supply as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving computer technology or as competition for technical personnel increases. Increasing demand for qualified personnel could also result in increased expenses to hire and retain qualified technical personnel and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profit margins.\nCompetitive Market for Account Executives and Technical Recruiters\nThe Company faces a highly competitive market for the limited number of qualified personnel. The competitive market for such personnel could affect the Company\u2019s ability to hire and retain such personnel, and, if the Company is successful in hiring technical recruiters and account executives, there can be no assurance that such hiring will result in increased revenue.\nRapidly Changing Industry\nThe computer industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. These include the overall increase in the sophistication and interdependency of computer technology and a focus by IT managers on cost-efficient solutions. There can be no assurance that these changes will not adversely affect demand for technical staffing services. Organizations may elect to perform such services in-house or outsource such functions to companies that do not utilize temporary staffing, such as that provided by the Company.\nAdditionally, a number of companies have, in recent years, limited the number of vendors on their approved vendor lists, and are continuing to do so. In some cases this has required the Company to subcontract with a company on the approved vendor list to provide services to customers. The staffing industry has also experienced margin erosion caused by this increased competition, and customers leveraging their buying power by consolidating the number of vendors with which they deal. In addition to these factors, there has been intense price competition in the area of IT staffing, pressure on billing rates and pressure by customers for discounts. The Company has endeavored to increase its technical recruiting staff in order to better respond to customers\u2019 increasing demands for both the timeliness and quantities of resume submittals against job requisitions.\nThe Company cannot predict at this time what long-term effect these changes will have on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nVendor Management Companies\nThere have been changes in the industry which have affected the Company\u2019s operating results. Many customers have retained third parties to provide vendor management services, and in excess of 33% of the Company\u2019s revenue is derived through vendor management companies. The third party is then responsible for retaining companies to provide temporary IT personnel. This results in the Company contracting with such third parties and not directly with the ultimate customer. This change weakens the Company\u2019s relationship with its customer, which makes it more difficult for the Company to maintain and expand its business with its existing customers. It also reduces the Company\u2019s profit margins.\nIn addition, the agreements with the vendor management companies are frequently structured as subcontracting agreements, with the vendor management company entering into a services agreement directly with the end customers. As a result, in the event of a bankruptcy of a vendor management company, the Company\u2019s ability to collect its outstanding receivables and continue to provide services could be adversely affected.\nEffect of Current Economic Uncertainties and Limited Growth in Company\u2019s Business\nDemand for the Company\u2019s IT staffing services has been and is significantly affected by the general economic environment. During periods of slowing economic activity, customers may reduce their IT projects and their demand for outside consultants. Therefore, any significant economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. As a result of the broad based economic downturn that began in 2008, the Company experienced a decrease in the number of consultants on billing with customers, only recently returning to the early 2008 numbers of consultants on billing with customers. Industry-wide IT spending during the 2017 fiscal year appears to have decreased, particularly among foreign based financial services customers. The Company expects that economic conditions will continue to affect the number of consultants on billing with customers and the Company\u2019s profitability. In addition to the impact of the economic uncertainties, the Company has not been successful in expanding its customer base beyond its core customers. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve growth in its revenue.\nEffect of Increases in Payroll-related Costs\nThe Company is required to pay a number of federal, state and local payroll and related costs, including unemployment insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, employer\u2019s portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes, among others, for our employees, including those placed with customers. Significant increases in the effective rates of any payroll-related costs would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. Recently, many of the states in which the Company conducts business have significantly increased their state unemployment tax rates in an effort to increase funding for unemployment benefits. Costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms and the imposition of penalties for failure to provide health insurance to employees under the Affordable Care Act which went into effect January 1, 2015. Additionally, the New York City Council has approved a measure which went into effect in April 2014 requiring the Company to provide five paid sick days per year. Several municipalities, such as Newark and Jersey City, New Jersey, have enacted similar statutes. The Company has not been able to sufficiently increase the fees charged to its customers to cover these mandated cost increases. There are also proposals on the federal and state levels to phase in paid or partially paid family leave. It is too early to determine how this will affect the Company\u2019s profitability. New York State recently passed a paid family leave law effective January 1, 2018 that is not expected to increase employer costs.\nEffect of Offshore Outsourcing\nThe current trend of companies moving technology jobs and projects offshore has caused and could continue to cause revenue to decline. In the past few years, more companies are using or are considering using low cost offshore outsourcing centers, particularly in India and other East Asian countries, to perform technology related work and projects. This trend has contributed to the decline in domestic IT staffing revenue for the industry. There can be no assurance that this trend will not continue to adversely impact the Company\u2019s IT staffing revenue.\nEffect of Immigration Restrictions\nThe Company obtains many of its technical personnel by subcontracting with companies that utilize foreign nationals entering the U.S. on work visas, primarily under the H-1B visa classification. The Company also sponsors foreign nationals on H-1B visas on a limited basis. The H-1B visa classification enables U.S. employers to hire qualified foreign nationals in positions that require an education at least equal to a bachelor\u2019s degree. U.S. Immigration laws and regulations are subject to legislative and administrative changes, as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement. Current and future restrictions on the availability of such visas could restrain the Company\u2019s ability to acquire the skilled professionals needed to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The scope and impact of these changes on the staffing industry and the Company remain unclear, however a narrow interpretation and vigorous enforcement could adversely affect the ability of entities with which the Company subcontracts to utilize foreign nationals and/or renew existing foreign national consultants on assignment. There can be no assurance that the Company or its subcontractors will be able to keep or replace all foreign nationals currently on assignment, or continue to acquire foreign national talent at the same rates as in the past.\nFluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results\nThe Company\u2019s revenue and operating results are subject to significant variations from quarter to quarter. Revenue is subject to fluctuation based upon a number of factors, including the timing and number of client projects commenced and completed during the quarter, delays incurred in connection with projects, the growth rate of the market for contract computer programming services and general economic conditions. Unanticipated termination of a project or the decision by a client not to proceed to the next stage of a project anticipated by the Company could result in decreased revenue and lower utilization rates which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. Compensation levels can be impacted by a variety of factors, including competition for highly skilled employees and inflation.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results also fluctuate due to seasonality. Typically, our billable hours, which directly affect our revenue and profitability, decrease in our third fiscal quarter. The holiday season and winter weather cause the number of billable work days for consultants on billing with customers to decrease. Additionally, at the beginning of the calendar year, which also falls within our third fiscal quarter, payroll taxes are at their highest. This results in our lowest gross margins of the year. The Company\u2019s operating results are also subject to fluctuation as a result of other factors.\nCompetition\nThe technical staffing industry is highly competitive and fragmented and has low barriers to entry. The Company competes for potential customers with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants, other providers of technical staffing services and, to a lesser extent, temporary personnel agencies. The Company competes for technical personnel with other providers of technical staffing services, systems integrators, providers of outsourcing services, computer systems consultants, customers and temporary personnel agencies. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining customers are accurate assessment of customers\u2019 requirements, timely assignment of technical employees with appropriate skills and the price of services. The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified technical personnel are compensation, availability, quality and variety of projects and schedule flexibility. The Company believes that many of the technical personnel included in its database may also be pursuing other employment opportunities. Therefore, the Company believes that its responsiveness to the needs of technical personnel is an important factor in the Company\u2019s ability to fill projects. Although the Company believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors, it expects competition to increase, and there can be no assurance that the Company will remain competitive.\nPotential for Contract and Other Liability\nThe personnel provided by the Company to customers provide services involving key aspects of its customers\u2019 software applications. A failure in providing these services could result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless of the Company\u2019s responsibility for such failure. The Company attempts to limit, contractually, its liability for damages arising from negligence or omissions in rendering services, but it is not always successful in negotiating such limits. Furthermore, due to increased competition and the requirements of vendor management companies, the Company may be required to accept less favorable terms regarding limitations on liability, including assuming obligations to indemnify customers for damages sustained in connection with the provision of our services. There can be no assurance our contracts will include the desired limitations of liability or that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts would be enforceable or would otherwise protect the Company from liability for damages.\nThe Company\u2019s business involves assigning personnel to the workplace of the client, typically under the client\u2019s supervision. Although the Company has little control over the client\u2019s workplace, the Company may be exposed to claims of discrimination and harassment and other similar claims as a result of inappropriate actions allegedly taken against the Company\u2019s personnel by customers. As an employer, the Company is also exposed to other possible employment-related claims. The Company is exposed to liability with respect to actions taken by its technical personnel while on a project, such as damages caused by technical personnel errors, misuse of client proprietary information or theft of client property. To reduce these exposures, the Company maintains insurance policies and a fidelity bond covering general liability, worker\u2019s compensation claims, errors and omissions and employee theft. In certain instances, the Company indemnifies its customers for these exposures. Certain of these costs and liabilities are not covered by insurance. There can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available and at its current price or that it will be adequate to, or will, cover any such liability.\nData Security\nOur ability to protect client, employee, and Company data and information is critical to our reputation and the success of our business. Our clients and employees expect that their confidential, personal and private information will be secure in our possession. Attacks against security systems have become increasingly sophisticated along with developments in technology, and such attacks have become more prevalent. Consequently, the regulatory environment surrounding cybersecurity and privacy has become more and more demanding and has resulted in new requirements and increasingly demanding standards for protection of information. As a result, the Company may incur increased expenses associated with adequately protecting confidential client, employee, and Company data and complying with applicable regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized third parties from breaching our systems and gaining unauthorized access to confidential client, employee, and Company data even if our cybersecurity measures are compliant with regulatory requirements and standards. Unauthorized third party access to confidential client, employee, and Company data stored in our system whether as a result of a third party system breach, systems failure or employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, and could subject us to monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution. Furthermore, unauthorized third party access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our customers, whether by our employees or third parties, could result in system disruptions, negative publicity, legal liability, monetary damages, and damage to our reputation.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nThe Company relies primarily upon a combination of trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual agreements to protect its proprietary rights. The Company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, customers and potential customers and limits access to and distribution of its proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information or that the Company will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights.\nVoting Power of Major Stockholder\nJoseph F. Hughes, the former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Treasurer of the Company, and members of his family own Common Stock representing approximately 46.9% of the Company\u2019s voting power as of June 30, 2017. As such, Joseph F. Hughes has significant voting power on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company\u2019s common stockholders.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Provisions May Inhibit a Change of Control\nIn addition to the significant ownership of Common Stock by Joseph F. Hughes and his family, certain provisions of the Company\u2019s charter and by-laws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for the Company and may thereby inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the holders of Common Stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices. Such provisions include a classified Board of Directors and advance notice requirements for nomination of directors and certain stockholder proposals set forth in the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws.\nNew Classes and Series of Stock\nThe Company\u2019s charter authorizes the Board of Directors to create new classes and series of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any such classes and series without further action of the stockholders. The issuance of additional classes and series of capital stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price could be extremely volatile and, as a result, investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them.\nAmong the factors that could affect the Company\u2019s stock price are:\n- limited float and a low average daily trading volume;\n- industry trends and the performance of the Company\u2019s customers;\n- fluctuations in the Company\u2019s results of operations;\n- litigation; and\n- general market conditions.\nThe stock market has, and may in the future, experience extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 74500, "SIC": 7371, "TIC": "TSRI"}
