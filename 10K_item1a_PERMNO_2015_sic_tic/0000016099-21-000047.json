{"cik": "16099", "company": "LUBYS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, and all other information included in this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and investors may lose part or all of their investment.\nRisks Related to the Plan of Liquidation and the Liquidation\nWe may not be able to pay liquidating distributions to our stockholders at the times and in the amounts expected.\nWe cannot predict the timing or amount of any liquidating distributions, as uncertainties exist as to the value we may receive upon the sale of our assets pursuant to our monetization strategy, the net value of any remaining assets after such sales are completed, the ultimate amount of our expenses associated with completing our monetization strategy, liabilities, the operating costs and amounts to be set aside for claims, obligations and provisions during the liquidation and winding-up process, and the related timing to complete such transactions. These and other factors make it impossible to predict with certainty the actual net cash amount that will ultimately be available for distribution to stockholders or the timing of any such distributions.\nThe amount of cash available to distribute to stockholders depends on our ability to successfully execute our monetization strategy and dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur efforts to enhance stockholder value through our monetization strategy may not be successful, which would significantly reduce the cash available for distribution to stockholders. We cannot assure you that our efforts to enhance stockholder value through the conduct of our monetization strategy will succeed. There will be risks associated with any potential divestiture transaction, including whether we will attract potential acquirers for the Company\u2019s businesses or its assets, and whether offers made by such potential acquirers, if any, will be at valuations that we deem reasonable. Moreover, we are not able to predict how long it will take to complete our monetization strategy, the delay of which may impact the timing of the dissolution. The timing and terms of any transaction in furtherance of our monetization strategy will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. A delay in, or failure to complete, any such transaction could have a material effect on our stock price and the amount of any potential distributions to stockholders.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully complete our monetization strategy could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, including public health risks related to COVID-19. We are exploring and evaluating potential transactions, the success or timing of which may be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to successfully monetize our assets, we must identify and complete one or more additional transactions with third parties. Our businesses and assets and the availability of potential buyers of our businesses and assets may be significantly impacted by public health issues or pandemics, including COVID-19. For example, the shutdown orders across the various jurisdictions in which we operate and other effects of COVID-19 have resulted in, and may continue to cause, decreased demand, and consequently decreased revenues, from the operation of our businesses. The uncertain severity and impact of COVID-19 could result in reduced demand to purchase our businesses and assets by third parties or reduced values such parties may ascribe to our businesses and assets.\nEven if we are able to identify potential transactions in furtherance of our monetization strategy, such buyers may be operationally constrained or unable to locate financing on attractive terms or at all, which risk may be heightened due to the uncertainty of COVID-19 and its impact. If financing is unavailable to potential buyers of our businesses or assets, or if potential buyers are unwilling to engage in transactions due to the uncertainty in the market, our ability to complete such transactions would be significantly impaired or we may provide further seller financing, which could cause the amounts ultimately available for distribution to stockholders to be dependent on the operational success of the buyers of our businesses or assets.\nAny negative impact on such third parties due to any of the foregoing events could cause costly delays and have a material adverse effect on our ability to return value to stockholders, including our ability to realize full value from a sale or other disposition of our businesses and assets as part of our monetization strategy. Any such negative impacts could also reduce the amount of cash we are able to distribute to stockholders.\nNotwithstanding stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation, the Board may determine not to proceed with the dissolution or may amend or modify the Plan of Liquidation without further stockholder approval.\nNotwithstanding stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation, the Board may determine, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, not to proceed with the dissolution or to amend or modify the Plan of Liquidation to the extent permitted by Delaware law without the necessity of further stockholder approval. If the Board elects to pursue any alternative to the Plan of Liquidation, stockholders may not receive any of the funds that might otherwise be available for distribution to stockholders. Similarly, pursuant to our monetization strategy, the Board may ultimately determine that the sale of the whole Company is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. We cannot assure you that the sale of the whole\nCompany will result in the same amount of distributable cash proceeds to stockholders compared to the dissolution. After the effective date of the filing of the certificate of dissolution, revocation of the dissolution would require stockholder approval under Delaware law.\nIf we fail to retain sufficient funds to pay the liabilities actually owed to our creditors, each stockholder receiving liquidating distributions could be liable for payment to our creditors for such stockholder's pro rata share of any shortfall, up to the amount actually distributed to such stockholder in connection with the dissolution.\nUnder Delaware law, in the event we fail to retain sufficient funds to pay the expenses and liabilities actually owed to our creditors, each stockholder could be held liable for payment to our creditors for claims brought during the three-year period after the effective date, up to the lesser of (1) such stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of amounts owed to creditors in excess of the contingency reserve and (2) the amounts previously received by such stockholder in dissolution from us and from any liquidating trust or trusts. Accordingly, in such event, a stockholder could be required to return part, or all, of the distributions previously made to such stockholder in the dissolution, and a stockholder could receive nothing from us under the Plan of Liquidation, but no stockholder will be liable for claims against the Company in excess of the amounts distributed to such stockholder. Moreover, in the event a stockholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received, a repayment of all or a portion of such amount could result in a stockholder incurring a net tax cost if the stockholder\u2019s repayment of an amount previously distributed does not cause a commensurate reduction in taxes payable.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nGeneral economic and business conditions as well as those specific to the restaurant industry may adversely affect our business and our net assets in liquidation.\nOur business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic which affected the restaurant industry business conditions in the United States. These factors include consumer income, interest rates, inflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. The restaurant industry is affected by changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, and consumer spending patterns. Discretionary consumer spending, which is critical to our success, is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. A deterioration in the global or local economy or other economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as unemployment levels, reduced home values, investment losses, inflation, business conditions, fuel and other energy costs, consumer debt levels, lack of available credit, consumer confidence, interest rates, tax rates and changes in tax laws, may reduce consumer confidence and affected consumers\u2019 ability or desire to spend disposable income. This may adversely affect our business by reducing overall consumer spending or by causing customers to reduce the frequency with which they dine out or to shift their spending to our competitors, any of which could result in lower revenues, increased costs, reduced traffic, or limits on pricing, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation.\nRegional events can adversely affect our financial performance.\nAll of our restaurants, and most of our CCS locations, are located in Texas. Our business may be adversely affected by economic conditions in Texas or the occurrence of an event of terrorism or natural disaster in any of the communities in which we operate. Also, given our geographic concentration, negative publicity relating to our restaurants could have a pronounced adverse effect on our overall revenues. Although we generally maintain property and casualty insurance to protect against property damage caused by casualties and natural disasters, inclement weather, flooding, hurricanes, and other acts of God, these events can adversely impact our sales by discouraging potential customers from going out to eat or by rendering a restaurant or CCS location inoperable for a significant amount of time.\nFailure to collect accounts receivable or amounts receivable under promissory notes provided by buyers of our businesses and assets could adversely affect our financial performance and net assets in liquidation.\nA portion of our accounts receivable is concentrated in our CCS operations among several customers. Failure to collect from several of these accounts receivable could adversely affect our financial performance and net assets in liquidation.\nAdditionally, we have been provided promissory notes by buyers of our businesses and assets. Failure to recognize the amounts anticipated to be collectible under these notes would adversely affect our net assets in liquidation and could reduce the amount of cash we are able to distribute to stockholders.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our net operating losses (\"NOLs\").\nAs of August 25, 2021, we had approximately $10.6 million of deferred tax assets related to our NOL carryforwards. The Company anticipates utilizing a portion, if not all, of its NOLs in connection with the anticipated sales of the Company\u2019s assets and businesses pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation. If the Company is unsuccessful in completing the anticipated sales of the Company\u2019s assets or otherwise limited in its ability to use its NOLs, the Company may be unable to utilize a portion or all of its\nNOLs and the net proceeds of the sales of our assets and businesses being available to distribute to shareholders may be less than anticipated.\nThe impact of inflation may adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe impact of inflation on food, labor and other aspects of our business can adversely affect our results of operations. Commodity inflation in food, beverages, and utilities can also impact our financial performance. Although we attempt to offset the effects of inflation through periodic menu price increases, cost controls, and incremental improvement in operating margins, we may not be able to completely eliminate such effects, which could adversely affect our financial performance and our net assets in liquidation.\nWe face the risk of adverse publicity and litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe may from, time to time, be the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging illness, injury or other food quality, health or operational concerns. Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants or to the restaurant industry in general may taint public perception of the Luby\u2019s Cafeteria and Fuddruckers brands. Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness, or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Publicity resulting from these allegations may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are liable. In addition, we are subject to employee claims alleging injuries, wage and hour violations, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination. In recent years, a number of restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace, employment, and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately determined to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend, and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, for any claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial performance and net assets in liquidation.\nWe may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information.\nWe accept electronic payment cards for payment in our restaurants. A number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen, including a number of highly publicized incidents with well-known retailers in recent years. In March, 2021, we were the victim of a cyber attack by hackers who deployed a version of ransomware that encrypted electronic files, locking us out of many of our point-of-sale and other systems. Such attacks, while they did not provide the hackers with access to confidential customer and employee information, did adversely affect our profits due to our temporary inability to operate our restaurants and increased costs associated with further protecting and restoring our computer systems. While we have taken preventative measures, no assurances can be provided that we will not be the subject of cyber attacks again in the future.\nWe may in the future become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.\nWe also are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees, and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels, and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. At the same time, we are relying increasingly on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer or employee information on our behalf. If the security and information systems of ours or of outsourced third party providers we use to store or process such information are compromised or if we, or such third parties, otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.\nLabor shortages or increases in labor costs could adversely affect our business, financial performance and net assets in liquidation.\nOur successful implementation of our monetization plan depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including regional managers, restaurant general managers and chefs, in a manner consistent with our standards and expectations. Given the announced Plan of Liquidation, we have found it difficult to recruit and retain qualified individuals. If we are unable to recruit and retain sufficient qualified individuals, our operations and reputation could be adversely affected, which may adversely affect the value of our business and ability to realize the proceeds for the sale of our assets to allow us to distribute the proceeds to stockholders. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. Our financial condition and announcement of our process of exploring strategic alternatives may result in difficulties in retaining and attracting qualified employees. Any increase in labor costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe success of our business is highly dependent upon our key management personnel. The loss of the services of any key management personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may impair our ability to retain and motivate key management personnel.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and react to changes in food, utility and other costs, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of the food and beverage products we purchase are affected by commodity pricing, and as such, are subject to price volatility caused by production problems, shortages, weather or other factors outside of our control. Our profitability depends, in part, on our successfully anticipating and reacting to changes in the prices of commodities. Therefore, we enter into purchase commitments with suppliers when we believe that it is advantageous for us to do so. If commodity prices were to increase, we may be forced to absorb the additional costs rather than transfer these increases to our customers in the form of menu price increases. Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs. Our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities. Our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes\nWe are required to pay real property taxes in respect of our properties and such taxes may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change. An increase in the assessed value of our properties or our property tax rates could adversely impact our financial condition and reduce the amount of future liquidating distributions to our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Governmental Laws and Regulations\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, healthcare, employee medical plans, sanitation, safety and fire standards, building codes and liquor licenses, federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act and applicable minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, family leave, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, healthcare and citizenship requirements), federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination, potential healthcare benefits legislative mandates, and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.\nAs a publicly traded corporation, we are subject to various rules and regulations as mandated by the SEC and the NYSE. Failure to timely comply with these rules and regulations could result in penalties and negative publicity.\nWe are subject to risks related to the provision of employee healthcare benefits, worker\u2019s compensation and employee injury claims.\nWe maintain a self-insured health benefit plan which provides medical and prescription drug benefits to certain of our employees electing coverage under the plan. Our exposure is limited by individual and aggregate stop-loss limits. We record expenses under the plan based on estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs and stop-loss insurance premiums. Self-insurance costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the expected liability for reported claims and the estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported, based on information on historical claims experience provided by our third party insurance advisors, adjusted as necessary based upon management\u2019s reasoned judgment. Actual employee medical claims expense may differ from estimated loss provisions based on historical experience. In the event our cost estimates differ from actual costs, we could incur additional unplanned costs, which could adversely impact our financial performance and our net assets in liquidation.\nWorkers\u2019 compensation coverage is provided through \u201cself-insurance\u201d by LFR. We record expenses under the plan based on estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, stop-loss insurance premiums, and expected trends. These\nestimates are then adjusted each year to reflect actual costs incurred. Actual costs under these plans are subject to variability that is dependent upon demographics and the actual costs of claims made. In the event our cost estimates differ from actual costs, we could incur additional unplanned costs, which could adversely impact our financial performance and our net assets in liquidation.\nIn March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"Affordable Care Act\") and Healthcare Education and Affordability Reconciliation Act was passed and signed into law. Among other things, the healthcare reform legislation includes mandated coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and healthcare benefits. Although requirements were phased in over a period of time, the most impactful provisions began in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.\nDue to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation, the lack of implementing regulations in some cases, and interpretive guidance, and the phased-in nature of the implementation, it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the healthcare reform legislation on our business over the coming years. Possible adverse effects of the healthcare reform legislation include reduced revenues, increased costs and exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or risk of loss of business. It is also possible that healthcare plans offered by other companies with which we compete for employees will make us less attractive to our current or potential employees. And in any event, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act has imposed some additional administrative costs on us, and those costs may increase over time. In addition, financial performance and net assets in liquidation could be materially adversely affected. Our franchisees face the potential of similar adverse effects, and many of them are small business owners who may have significant difficulty absorbing the increased costs.\nAn increase in the minimum wage and regulatory mandates could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures have increased and will consider increases in the minimum wage. The restaurant industry is intensely competitive, and if the minimum wage is increased, we may not be able to transfer all of the resulting increases in operating costs to our customers in the form of price increases. In addition, because our business is labor intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs that could adversely affect our financial performance and net assets and liabilities in liquidation.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe price of our common stock may experience volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock can be volatile as we execute the Plan of Liquidation, which may continue or become more severe if and when additional transactions or business arrangements are announced.", "PERMNO": 64020, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "LUB"}
