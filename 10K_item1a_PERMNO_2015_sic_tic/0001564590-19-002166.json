Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows.\nThe markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nSome of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns. A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are industry specific or macroeconomic and in the event of a downturn; we have no way of knowing if, when and to what extent there might be a recovery. Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results.\nAt December 31, 2018, Airbus and Boeing had a combined backlog of 13,528 aircraft or over eight years of production at 2018 delivery rates. To the extent any significant deferrals, cancellations or reduction in demand results in decreased aircraft build rates, it would reduce net sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income. Approximately 70% of our net sales for 2018 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry, which includes 87% from Airbus and Boeing aircraft and 13% from regional and business aircraft. Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including delays in the startup or ramp-up of new programs, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air (including as a result of terrorist events and any subsequent military response), a significant change in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections or disruptions throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth.\nOur content on the A350 is approximately $4.8 million per plane and it is our largest program and we expect significant sales from this program as Airbus reaches its projected buildrates of 10 per month. Both Airbus and Boeing have experienced various delays in the start and ramp up of several aircraft programs, including the A380, B787, B747-8, A400M, and A350. In the past, these have delayed our expected growth or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth. Future delays in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results.\nIn addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain. In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, index clauses, hedging and other actions.\nA significant decline in business with Airbus, Boeing, Vestas, or other large customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition.\nWe have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and wind energy markets. In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 87%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 28%, of our 2018 net sales were made to Airbus and Boeing and their related subcontractors. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, approximately 41% and 44% of our total consolidated net sales, respectively, were to Airbus, and its related subcontractors and approximately 25% for both years of our total consolidated net sales were to Boeing and its related subcontractors. In the wind energy market, our primary customer is Vestas. Significant changes in the demand for our customers\u2019 end products, program delays, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by Airbus, Boeing or Vestas or any of our other large customers could materially impair our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. The level of purchases by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, disruptions in deliveries, business disruptions, strikes and other factors.\nA decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability.\nOur profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, which may be supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources. We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, acrylonitrile, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn, aluminum foil and aramid paper. Any restrictions on the supply, or an increase in the cost, of our raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins. Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements, hedging or by passing cost increases to our customers may not be successful.\nThe occurrence of material operational problems, including but not limited to failure of, or interruption to, key equipment or natural disasters, or inability to install, staff and qualify necessary capacity, achievement of planned manufacturing improvements, or inability to meet customer specifications, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility. With respect to certain facilities, such events could have a material effect on our company as a whole.\nReductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our net sales.\nSpace and defense production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow and the increased demand for composite-intensive programs may not continue. In addition, the production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 17% of our net sales in 2018 were to the Space & Defense market of which about 86% were related to military programs in the United States and other countries.\nIf we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses.\nWe have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results.\nWe believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. In 2018, 52% of our production and 58% of our customer sales occurred outside of the United States. Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations and we intend to continue to make such investments in the future. Our international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: (a) general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy; (b) the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; (c) foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the U.S.; (d) cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases of goods and equipment and transfers of technology; (e) tax rates may vary and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; (f) governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including, but not limited to, the exit of the U.K. from the European Union; and (g) the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell product in certain markets. Any one of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. With respect to tariffs, the current policy of the U.S. Federal Government could potentially increase the costs of our materials, make our products sold from the U.S. more expensive to our non-U.S. customers, and increase our cost of production. In addition, we have production facilities within the United Kingdom that supply customers in the European Union and customers within the United Kingdom that are supplied by production facilities in the European Union, and any future tariffs or other disruptions to these trade flows related to the exit of the U.K. from the European Union could negatively impact our business.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business. For example, our European operations sell a majority of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overhead costs and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are primarily denominated in Euros, British pound sterling or U.S. dollars. As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While we enter into currency hedge agreements from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks.\nOur business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network intrusions.\nWe depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology system have become more sophisticated. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, activism or other motivations, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks, performing reconnaissance, impersonating authorized users, stealing, corrupting or restricting our access to data, among other activities. We continue to update our infrastructure, security tools, employee training and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats and to prevent their recurrence. While company personnel have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents, cybersecurity attacks could still occur and may lead to potential data corruption and exposure of proprietary and confidential information. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any intrusion may also cause operational stoppages, fines, penalties, litigation of governmental investigations and proceedings, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. Additionally, we may incur additional costs to comply with our customers\u2019, including the U.S. Government\u2019s increased cybersecurity protections and standards.\nWe could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements.\nOur operations require the handling, use, storage and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health and safety. These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste and remediation of contaminated sites. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in\norder to comply with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future.\nWe have been named as a \u201cpotentially responsible party\u201d under Superfund or similar state laws at sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. We have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves. The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us. Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where assessments have been conducted. Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we may be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. In particular, climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress has considered climate change-related legislation and may review the issue in the near future. Specific policy measures could include cap and trade provisions or a carbon tax. The European Union has instituted the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and some of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may in the future be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment or limit our ability to grow.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, mergers, business combinations or joint ventures may entail certain operational and financial risks.\nOver the past several years we have completed several strategic acquisitions of complementary manufacturing companies, as well as strategic investments in companies. We expect to continue to explore complementary acquisitions, investments and joint ventures and may also pursue divestures of business lines that do not fit with our core strategy. We may also engage in further vertical integration. We may face competition for attractive targets and may not be able to source appropriate acquisition targets at prices acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, these types of transactions may require significant liquidity, which may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nThere can be no assurance that we will realize the intended benefits from any such transactions. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Even if successfully integrated the acquired business may not achieve the results we expect or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned.", "PERMNO": 61567, "SIC": 2821, "TIC": "HXL"}
