{"cik": "713671", "company": "DNB FINANCIAL CORP /PA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestment in DNB\u2019s Common Stock involves risk and the market price of DNB\u2019s Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including those that follow. The following list contains certain risks that may be unique to DNB and to the banking industry. The following list of risks should not be viewed as an all-inclusive list.\n\ufeff\nChanges in interest rates could reduce DNB's net interest margin, net interest income, fee income and net income. - Interest and fees on loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, account for a significant part of DNB's net income. Interest rates are key drivers of DNB's net interest margin and subject to many factors beyond DNB's control. As interest rates change, DNB's net interest income is affected. Increased interest rates in the future could result in DNB's interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of divergence in financial instrument maturities and/or competitive pressures. Because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently and at different times to market interest rate changes, changes in interest rates can increase or decrease DNB's net interest income. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates would reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or re-price more quickly, and because the magnitude of repricing of interest earning assets is often greater than interest bearing liabilities, falling interest rates would reduce net interest income. In addition, substantially higher interest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease DNB's net interest income. Also, changes in interest rates might also impact the values of equity and debt securities under management and administration by DNB's wealth management business, which may have a negative impact on fee income.\n\ufeff\nIf DNB's allowance for credit losses is insufficient to absorb losses in its loan portfolio, DNB's earnings could decrease. - All borrowers carry the potential to default, and DNB's remedies to recover upon a default may not fully satisfy amounts previously loaned by DNB. DNB maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense, which represents DNB's best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in DNB's judgment, is necessary to reserve for estimated credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Those risks are affected by, among other things:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and cash flows of the borrowers and/or the projects being financed;\n\u2022\nthe changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of collateralized loans;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the loans in the portfolio;\n\u2022\nthe credit history of the particular borrowers; and\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and industry conditions.\n\ufeff\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, including those identified above, all of which may undergo material changes. If DNB's assumptions and estimates are incorrect, its allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. In addition, changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers generally or certain borrowers in particular, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of DNB's control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses. Bank regulatory authorities periodically review DNB's allowance for credit losses and also may require us to increase the provision for credit losses or recognize additional loan charge-offs based on judgments different than DNB's. An increase in the allowance for credit losses results in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on DNB's financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nDowngrades in U.S. Government and federal agency securities could adversely affect us. - In addition to causing economic and financial markets disruptions, any downgrades of U.S. Government and federal agency securities and/or failures to raise the U.S. debt limit if necessary in the future, could, among other things, materially adversely affect the market value of the U.S. and other government and governmental agency securities DNB owns, the availability of those securities for use as collateral for borrowing, and its ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of its business and financial results and condition. In particular, the impact of these events could involve increases in interest rates and disruption in payment systems, money markets and long-term or short-term fixed income markets, which could adversely affect the cost and availability of funding to us. Adverse consequences as a result of any downgrades also could extend to borrowers and, as a result, could adversely affect the borrowers' ability to repay their loans.\n\ufeff\nDNB's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by regional economic conditions and real estate values. - DNB's loan and deposit activities are largely based in eastern Pennsylvania. As a result, DNB's financial performance is closely tied to economic conditions in this region. This region experienced deteriorating local economic conditions during 2008 through 2011, and a continued downturn in the regional real estate market may adversely affect us because DNB's loans are concentrated in this regional area and a large percentage of its loans are secured by real property, and further declines in real estate values reduce the value of that loan collateral. This may limit the amount DNB may recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate collateral,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwhich would adversely affect DNB's results of operations. In addition, a significant portion of DNB's loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate loans. The ability of these borrowers to repay their loans is often dependent on the borrower receiving sufficient rental payments. Economic conditions may affect the ability of tenants to make rental payments on a timely basis and/or may cause some tenants not to renew their leases, which may adversely affect a borrower's ability to make loan payments. In addition, if operating expenses, taxes and other expenses associated with commercial real estate properties increase materially, the tenant's ability to repay, and therefore the borrower's ability to make timely loan payments to us, could be adversely affected. Any of these factors could increase the amount of DNB's non-performing loans, increase its provision for credit losses and reduce its net income.\n\ufeff\nGeneral economic conditions and other events may adversely affect DNB's wealth management business revenues. - A general economic slowdown, disruptions in the financial markets, and other events and occurrences that impact the economy could decrease the value of the assets under management and administration by DNB's wealth management business, which would result in lower fee income and could cause clients to seek alternative investment opportunities with other wealth management or financial services providers, which could result in reduced revenue.\n\ufeff\nDecreased residential mortgage origination or changes to DNB's residential mortgage related revenues and expenses as a result of actions taken by competitors and regulators could adversely affect DNB's results of operations. - DNB originates and sells residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates and pricing decisions by DNB's competitors in this market affect demand for DNB's mortgage loan products and revenue DNB realizes on the sale of mortgage loans, all of which impact DNB's net income. New regulations, increased regulatory scrutiny, changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets and other factors also affect DNB's mortgage loan business, and make it more difficult or costly to operate this business.\n\ufeff\nDNB may not be able to effectively manage its growth. - DNB's future operating results and financial condition depend to a large extent on its ability to successfully manage its growth. DNB's growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on DNB's management and operating systems and resources. Whether through acquisitions, organic growth or a combination thereof, DNB's ability to expand its business is dependent upon its ability to:\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\ncontinue to implement and improve its processes and systems, including credit underwriting, financial, accounting and enterprise risk management;\n\u2022\ncomply with an increasing number of new laws, rules and regulations governing its business, and changes to existing laws, rules and regulations;\n\u2022\nscale its information technology systems; and\n\u2022\nmaintain appropriate staffing levels.\n\ufeff\nAddressing issues relating to DNB's growth may divert management from DNB's existing business and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand DNB's administrative and operational infrastructure and, if DNB is unable to effectively manage and grow its banking franchise, including to the satisfaction of DNB's regulators, DNB's business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if DNB is unable to manage its current and future expansion in its operations, DNB may experience compliance, operational and regulatory problems and delays, have to slow its pace of growth or even stop its market and product expansion, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could materially and adversely affect us. If DNB experiences difficulties with the development of new business activities or the integration process of acquired businesses, the anticipated benefits of any particular acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, DNB may be unable to recognize synergies, operating efficiencies and/or expected benefits within expected timeframes and cost projections, or at all. DNB also may not be able to preserve the goodwill of an acquired financial institution. DNB's growth could lead to increases in its legal, audit, administrative and financial compliance costs, which could materially and adversely affect us.\n\ufeff\nDNB may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all. - DNB may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs. DNB's ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of DNB's control, and its financial performance. DNB's customary sources of liquidity include, but are not limited to, deposits, inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. Any occurrence that may limit DNB's access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets may adversely affect DNB's capital costs and ability to raise capital and, in turn, DNB's liquidity. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on DNB's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nDNB faces strong competition for clients and this competition could affect DNB's operating results. - DNB operates in a highly competitive market and experiences competition in DNB's market from both banks and a variety of other financial institutions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nDNB competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community, super-regional, national, and international financial institutions that operate offices in DNB's primary market areas and elsewhere. DNB competes with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. Many financial service providers believe DNB's primary market is an attractive market because of its strong economic growth. As a result, DNB is experiencing particularly intense competition in DNB's primary marketplace. While DNB's strategy is to attract customers by providing personalized services and making use of the business and personal ties of DNB's management, there is no assurance DNB will keep or increase market acceptance and be able to operate profitably. Many of DNB's competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions. These institutions offer some services, such as extensive and established branch networks, that DNB does not provide. There are also a number of other community banks in its market that share its general marketing focus. There is a risk that DNB will not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in its market, and that DNB may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, which could result in reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to us. All of these factors may adversely impact DNB\u2019s ability to maintain or increase profitability.\n\ufeff\nDNB depends on its executive officers and key personnel, and DNB's ability to operate its business and implement its strategy depends significantly on DNB's ability to attract and retain individuals with experience and relationships in the markets in which DNB operates and intends to expand. - DNB believes that its future success, including the implementation of its strategy, will depend in large part on the skills of its executive management team and ability to motivate and retain these and other key personnel and attract and retain new personnel with expertise and relationships in the markets DNB now serves and intends to serve. The loss of service of one or more of DNB's executive officers or key personnel, its inability to replace departing personnel and/or its ability to hire new personnel to implement DNB's strategy could limit DNB's growth and could materially adversely affect DNB's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Competition for qualified candidates is intense, and DNB cannot assure you that DNB will be able to retain and recruit management and other key personnel to meet its needs.\n\ufeff\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk. - From time to time, DNB may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within its existing lines of business. There may be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets for those new lines of business or new products or services are not yet fully developed. DNB may invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services. DNB's anticipated timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and DNB's price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. In addition, external factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact development and implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Any new line of business and/or new product or service also could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of DNB's system of internal controls. If DNB fails to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services, DNB's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nThe fair value of DNB's investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions which, under some circumstances can lead to other-than-temporary impairment. - As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of DNB's investment securities portfolio was approximately $181.3 million. Factors beyond DNB's control can significantly influence the fair value of DNB's investment securities and can result in adverse changes to their fair value. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions with respect to the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to any underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and instability in the capital markets. These and other factors could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary typically requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\n\ufeff\nChanges to estimates and assumptions DNB makes in preparing its financial statements could adversely affect its operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition and capital levels. - The preparation of DNB's financial statements requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that could affect DNB's reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and expense during the reporting periods. Changes to those estimates or assumptions could materially affect its operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition and capital levels.\n\ufeff\nIf DNB lost a significant portion of its low-cost deposits, it would negatively impact its liquidity and profitability. - DNB's profitability depends in part on DNB's success in attracting and retaining a stable base of low-cost deposits. While DNB generally does not believe these core deposits are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, the competition for these deposits in DNB's markets is strong and customers are increasingly seeking investments that are safe, including the purchase of U.S. Treasury securities and other government-guaranteed obligations, as well as the establishment of accounts at the largest, most-well capitalized banks. If DNB were to lose a significant portion of its low-cost deposits, it would negatively impact its liquidity and profitability.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nChanges in accounting standards and policies can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how DNB records and reports its financial results. - DNB's accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how DNB records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The regulatory bodies that establish accounting standards, including, among others, the Financial Accounting, or FASB, and the SEC, periodically revise or issue new financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of its financial statements. These changes, and the effects of these changes, can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how DNB records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. DNB could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior period financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised accounting guidance could have a material adverse effect on its reported financial results.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, DNB must exercise judgment in appropriately applying many of its accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles. In some cases, DNB may have to select a particular accounting policy or method from two or more alternatives. In some cases, the accounting policy or method chosen might be reasonable under the circumstances and yet might result in its reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported if DNB had selected a different policy or method. Accounting policies are critical to fairly presenting DNB's financial condition and results of operations and may require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain.\n\ufeff\nIf DNB fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, its business could be adversely affected. - DNB is dependent upon maintaining an effective system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that transactions and activities are conducted in accordance with established policies and procedures and are all captured and reported in the financial statements. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and expectations of employee conduct and can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls, any failure to adhere to those internal controls, or any circumvention of DNB's controls could have a material adverse effect on its operations, net income, financial condition, reputation and compliance with laws and regulations.\n\ufeff\nTechnological systems failures, interruptions and security breaches could negatively impact DNB's operations. - Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of DNB's business, as DNB uses such systems to manage its customer relationships, its general ledger, its deposits, and its loans. While DNB has established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions, and security breaches, DNB cannot assure you that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of DNB's security systems could deter customers from using DNB's website and DNB's online banking service, which involve the transmission of confidential information. Although DNB relies on commonly-used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect its systems from compromises or breaches of security. In addition, DNB outsources certain of its data processing to third-party providers. If DNB's third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if DNB has difficulty in communicating with them, DNB's ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and DNB's business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. The occurrence of any systems failure, interruption, or breach of security could damage DNB's reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on DNB's financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAdditionally, financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. DNB's ability to meet the needs of its customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on DNB's ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of DNB's competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than DNB does and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. If DNB fails to keep pace with technological change, it could have a material adverse impact on DNB's business.\n\ufeff\nLoss of, or failure to adequately safeguard, confidential or proprietary information may adversely affect DNB's operations, financial performance or reputation. - DNB regularly collects, processes, transmits and stores significant amounts of confidential information regarding its customers, employees and others. This information is necessary for DNB to conduct its business activities, including the ongoing maintenance of deposit, loan, investment management and other account relationships for DNB's customers, and receiving instructions and completing transactions for DNB's customers and other users of DNB's products and services. In addition, DNB compiles, processes, transmits and stores proprietary, non-public information concerning its business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on DNB's behalf. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. A failure in or breach of DNB's operational or information security systems, or those of DNB's service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks, information security breaches or otherwise could adversely affect its business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage DNB's reputation, increase DNB's costs and/or cause losses. If this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused, improperly disclosed or lost, DNB could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss. Although DNB employs a variety of safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmisuse, improper disclosure or loss, DNB cannot assure you that these safeguards will be effective in every instance, or that if mishandling, misuse, improper disclosure or loss of the information did occur, those events would be promptly detected and addressed. Additionally, as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, DNB may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\n\ufeff\nEmployee errors or misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm DNB's reputation. - Errors or misconduct by DNB's employees could adversely impact DNB's business. Employee misconduct could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions DNB takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. Although DNB maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including employee errors and customer or employee fraud, should those internal controls fail to prevent or detect errors or improper actions, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, DNB's business and reputation could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nEnvironmental risks associated with DNB's lending activities could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. - A significant portion of DNB's loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the course of its business, DNB may own or foreclose on and take title to real estate, which could result in DNB's being subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. DNB may become responsible to a governmental agency or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties in connection with environmental contamination, or DNB may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with environmental investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. If DNB were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on DNB's financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could adversely affect DNB's business. - A variety of events over which DNB has no control, including severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and others could have a significant adverse effect on its business. Events such as these could affect the stability of its deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant damage to properties funded by DNB's loans, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses.\n\ufeff\nPotential additional acquisitions in the future may disrupt DNB's business and dilute shareholder value. - DNB may pursue additional acquisitions of other financial institutions in the future as part of its growth strategy. As a result, DNB may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. In any acquisition, DNB may pay for the acquisition through the payment of cash, the issuance of its common stock or other securities, or a combination thereof. Depending on the size of the acquisition, the amount DNB pays may be material. Using cash in connection with any acquisition could materially affect DNB's cash resources or require us to incur indebtedness. Using shares of common stock as payment could dilute the ownership interest of current shareholders. In addition, the required accounting treatment for certain acquisitions could result in us having to recognize a charge against earnings, which could materially and adversely affect DNB's results of operations during the period in which the charge is recognized. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with our prior or potential future acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized. Any potential charges for impairment related to goodwill would not directly impact cash flow or tangible capital.\n\ufeff\nAcquisition activities generally involve a number of additional risks and potential effects on us and DNB's business, including:\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, including the diversion of management resources from the operation of DNB's existing business;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense necessary to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired company; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties relating to the conversion of operational, financial, accounting and customer data of the acquired company onto its systems.\n\ufeff\nDNB may not be successful in addressing the risks and inherent challenges in completing acquisitions. DNB may lose key employees, experience disruption of DNB's business and customer relationships, incur unexpected costs and face a variety of other unanticipated challenges, any of which could result in not achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. If DNB is not able to successfully identify and address the risks and challenges associated with acquisitions, its business may be harmed and its financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future, which could limit the growth of DNB's business. - DNB's future growth may depend, in part, on its ability to expand its business through additional acquisitions of other financial institutions in the future. DNB expects that other banking and financial service companies, many of which have significantly greater resources than us, will compete with us in seeking to complete such acquisitions. This could decrease out chances of growing through acquisitions and increase prices for potential acquisition opportunities that DNB believes are attractive. Also, DNB's acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If DNB fails to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals for a proposed acquisition, DNB will not be able to complete a transaction which DNB believes to be in its best interests. DNB's regulators consider its capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance and levels of goodwill and intangibles, among other factors, when considering DNB's acquisition and expansion proposals. If DNB is unable to pursue and complete acquisitions, its ability to grow its business could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nDNB operates in a highly regulated environment, and the laws and regulations that govern its operations, changes in those laws and regulations, or its failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, could materially and adversely affect us. - DNB is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. These are intended to protect customers, depositors and the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund and not shareholders. Among other things, these laws and regulations prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on its business activities, limit the dividends or distributions that DNB can pay, restrict the ability of DNB First to engage in transactions with DNB, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in its capital than GAAP. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs, and may make certain business practices or products impermissible or uneconomic. DNB's failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on its business activities, reputational harm, fines and other penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive and also materially and adversely affect us.\n\ufeff\nPreviously-enacted and potential future legislation, including legislation to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system, could adversely affect DNB's business. - Market conditions have resulted in the creation of various programs by the U.S. Congress, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC that were designed to enhance market liquidity and bank capital. As these programs expire, are withdrawn or reduced, the impact on the financial markets, and banks in general and their customers is unknown. This could have the effect of, among other things, reducing liquidity, raising interest rates, reducing fee revenue, limiting the ability to raise capital, all of which could have an adverse impact on DNB's financial condition. Additionally, the federal government has passed a variety of other reforms related to banking and the financial services industry, including the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. Effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on its business include:\n\ufeff\n\u2022\nchanges to regulatory capital requirements;\n\u2022\nexclusion of hybrid securities, including trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010 from Tier 1 capital;\n\u2022\ncreation of new government regulatory agencies, such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau;\n\u2022\npotential limitations on federal preemption;\n\u2022\nchanges to deposit insurance assessments;\n\u2022\nregulation of debit interchange fees DNB earns;\n\u2022\nchanges in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees DNB may charge; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds, commonly referred to as the Volker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments.\nSome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment. Many provisions, however, will require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented, some of which have been proposed by the applicable federal agencies. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may have unintended effects, which will not be clear until implementation. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act could limit DNB's business activities, require changes to certain of its business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise materially and adversely\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\naffect us. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements could also materially and adversely affect us.\n\ufeff\nNew capital rules that were recently issued generally require insured depository institutions and certain holding companies to hold more capital. The impact of the new rules on DNB's financial condition and operations is uncertain. - In July 2013, U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued final rules that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to DNB and DNB First. The new rules revise, among other things, risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk weighted assets to make those standards consistent with agreements that were reached by Basel III and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Certain requirements of the rule began to phase in on January 1, 2015 and the remaining requirements of the rule will be phased by January 1, 2019. The new rules include certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those currently in place. In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions (including dividends) or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a \"capital conservation buffer\" on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019. Furthermore, in the current economic and regulatory environment, bank regulators may impose capital requirements that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if DNB were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in modifications to its business strategy and could limit its ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or repurchasing its shares.\n\ufeff\nThe FDIC's restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could materially and adversely affect us. - The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, including DNB First, up to applicable limits. The amount of a particular institution's deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution's risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution's risk classification is assigned based on certain factors, including capital levels and the level of supervisory concern regulators believe the institution poses. Market developments have significantly depleted the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. As a result of recent economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit insurance premiums for insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, there may need to be further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums. DNB is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that DNB is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, DNB may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially and adversely affect us, including by reducing DNB's profitability or limiting its ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\n\ufeff\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may reshape consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, which may directly impact DNB's business practices relating to consumer financial products or services. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the \"Federal consumer financial laws, and to prevent evasions thereof,\" with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \"unfair, deceptive, or abusive\" in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service (\"UDAP authority\"). The potential reach of the CFPB's broad new rulemaking powers and UDAP authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including us, is currently unknown.\n\ufeff\nDNB First is subject to federal and state and fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties. - Federal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB, and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to DNB First's performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact DNB First's rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact DNB's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nDNB faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. - The Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \"PATRIOT Act\") and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, including us, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury Department to administer the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the Justice Department, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the \"OFAC\"). If its policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, DNB would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, including possible restrictions on DNB's ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan, which could materially and adversely affect us. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\n\ufeff\nDNB's share price may change for a variety of reasons, some of which are beyond DNB's control. - DNB's share price can fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, some of which are not under DNB's control. These factors could cause the share price to decrease regardless of DNB's operating results. These factors include:\n\ufeff\n\u2022\nDNB's financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects;\n\u2022\nDNB's past and future dividend practice;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in DNB's operating results or in the quality of DNB's assets;\n\u2022\noperating results and securities price performance of companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022\nthe credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of DNB's equity or equity-related securities; and\n\u2022\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility and other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events.\nIn addition, DNB's share price can be affected by the level of trading in its common stock. The trading volume for the common stock has historically been less than that of larger financial services companies. In light of the relatively low trading volume, significant sales of its common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of the common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions.\n\ufeff\nDNB may sell additional shares of its common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for its common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of DNB's common stock. - DNB is not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or other securities, including securities that may be convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its common stock. Some of these securities may have distribution rights in connection with liquidation or other rights, including dividend and voting rights, senior to the rights of DNB's common stock. The future issuance of shares of common stock or other securities could have a dilutive effect on the holders of DNB's common stock. Additionally, the market value of DNB's common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or other securities or the perception that such sales could occur.\n\ufeff\nProvisions in DNB's articles of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of us, which could discourage transactions that would otherwise be in the best interests of DNB's shareholders and could entrench management. - Provisions of DNB's amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and applicable provisions of Pennsylvania law may delay, inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of its business through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or some other method even though some shareholders might believe a change in control is desirable.\n\ufeff\nDNB relies on dividends from DNB First for most of DNB's revenue. - DNB is a bank holding company and its operations are conducted by DNB's subsidiaries from which DNB receives dividends. The ability of DNB's subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to legal and regulatory limitations, profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. The ability of DNB First to pay cash dividends to DNB is limited by its obligation to maintain sufficient capital and by other restrictions on its cash dividends that are applicable to banks. If DNB First is not permitted to pay cash dividends to DNB, it is unlikely that DNB would be able to pay cash dividends on its common stock.\n\ufeff\nCombining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized. - The challenges involved in combining the operations of DNB and ERB include,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\namong other things, integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds, combining different corporate cultures, and retaining key employees. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or disruption of each company's ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect DNB's ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The integration of the two companies will require the experience and expertise of certain key employees of ERB who are expected to be retained by DNB. DNB may not be successful in retaining these employees for the time period necessary to successfully integrate ERB's operations with those of DNB. In addition, as with any merger of banking institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to take their deposits out of DNB. The success of the combined company following the merger may depend in large part on the ability to integrate the two businesses, business models and cultures. DNB may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings, revenue enhancements, and other anticipated synergies, and may not be able to capitalize upon the existing customer relationships of ERB to the extent anticipated, or it may take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected to achieve these goals. If DNB is not able to integrate the companies' operations successfully and in a timely manner, the expected benefits of the merger may not be realized, and this could have an adverse effect on DNB's business, results of operation and stock price.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill Impairment may adversely impact our results of operations. Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations. Under current accounting standards, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are no longer amortized but, instead, are evaluated for impairment periodically or when impairment indicators are present. Evaluation of goodwill and such other intangible assets could result in circumstances where the applicable intangible asset is deemed to be impaired for accounting purposes. Under such circumstances, the intangible asset\u2019s impairment would be reflected as a charge to earnings in the period during which such impairment is identified. Management evaluated the goodwill using an analysis of required measures of value, including the current stock price as an indicator of minority interest value, change of control multiples as a measure of controlling interest value and discounted cash flow analysis as a measure of going concern value and applied a weighting based on appraisal standards to arrive at a valuation conclusion that indicated no impairment at December 31, 2016.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income, ROE and ROA, and our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 92873, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "DNBF"}
