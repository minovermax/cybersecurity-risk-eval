{"cik": "1002517", "company": "Nuance Communications, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below when evaluating the company and when deciding whether to invest in the company. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe are important to an investor may also harm our business operations. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or our results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur liquidity, operations, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant market volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. While we have not experienced significant disruptions to our ability to conduct business thus far as a result of the pandemic, we are currently conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications.\nThe extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact our business, operations, and financial results in the future will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including:\n\u2022the duration and scope of the pandemic;\n\u2022governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity;\n\u2022the actions taken in response to economic disruption;\n\u2022the impact of business disruptions on our customers and partners and the resulting impact on their demand for our products and services;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 ability to pay for our products and services; and\n\u2022our ability to provide our products and services, including as a result of our employees working remotely and/or closures of offices and facilities.\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continually assessing its potential effects on our business. Many of our customers are hospitals and other healthcare providers that are facing capital shortages and other changes to their businesses as they focus on fighting the pandemic. As a result, in particular with respect to our healthcare customers, our net new sales may be lower than expected; our ability to recognize revenue may be negatively impacted due to implementation delays, decreased utilization of certain products such as our PowerScribe and DAX solutions, decrease in volumes where we have transaction-based revenue, or other factors; our collections may be delayed, which will negatively affect our cash flows; some customers may go out of business, and we will be unsecured creditors and may not be able to collect what we are owed; our ability to provide 24x7 worldwide support to our customers may be affected; and our employees\u2019 productivity may be negatively impacted as a result of almost all of our workforce working from home. The pandemic and accompanying market volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational changes we have made in response cannot be accurately predicted at this time.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully.\nThere are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in our targeted markets. The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry and regulatory standards, emerging business and distribution models, disruptive software and hardware technology developments, short product and service life cycles, price sensitivity on the part of customers, and frequent new product introductions, including alternatives for certain of our products that offer limited functionality at significantly lower costs or free of charge. Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers. Furthermore, there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions.\nThe competition in our targeted markets could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products and solutions we license or sell or the prices we can charge. Some of our current or potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do, and in certain cases may be able to include or combine their competitive products or technologies with other of their products or technologies in a manner whereby the competitive functionality is available at lower cost or free of charge within the larger offering. To the extent they do so, market acceptance and penetration of our products, and therefore our revenue and bookings, may be adversely affected. Our success depends substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies and to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological\nenhancements. If we are unable to develop or acquire new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes our business will suffer.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenue, bookings and operating results have fluctuated materially in the past and we expect such fluctuations to continue in the future. These fluctuations may cause our results of operations not to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors which would likely cause the price of our stock to decline. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in operating results include:\n\u2022volume, timing and fulfillment of customer orders and receipt of royalty reports;\n\u2022fluctuating sales by our channel partners to their customers;\n\u2022customers delaying their purchasing decisions in anticipation of new versions of our products;\n\u2022contractual counterparties failing to meet their contractual commitments to us;\n\u2022introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022cybersecurity or data breaches;\n\u2022seasonality in purchasing patterns of our customers;\n\u2022reduction in the prices of our products in response to competition, market conditions or contractual obligations;\n\u2022returns and allowance charges in excess of accrued amounts;\n\u2022timing of significant marketing and sales promotions;\n\u2022impairment of goodwill or intangible assets;\n\u2022the pace of the transition to an on-demand and transactional revenue model;\n\u2022delayed realization of synergies resulting from our acquisitions;\n\u2022accounts receivable that are not collectible and write-offs of excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u2022increased expenditures incurred pursuing new product or market opportunities;\n\u2022higher than anticipated costs related to fixed-price contracts with our customers;\n\u2022change in costs due to regulatory or trade restrictions;\n\u2022expenses incurred in litigation matters, whether initiated by us or brought by third parties against us, and settlements or judgments we are required to pay in connection with disputes; and\n\u2022general economic trends as they affect the customer bases into which we sell.\nDue to the foregoing factors, among others, our revenue, bookings and operating results are difficult to forecast. Our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenue, and we may not be able to reduce our expenses quickly to respond to near-term shortfalls in projected revenue. Therefore, our failure to meet revenue expectations would seriously harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our revenue and bookings are derived, and a significant portion of our research and development activities are based, outside the United States. Our results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory, foreign currency fluctuation and other risks associated with these international regions.\nBecause we operate worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We generate most of our international revenue and bookings in Canada and Europe, and we anticipate that revenue and bookings from international operations could increase in the future. In addition, some of our products are developed outside the United States and we have a large number of employees in India who provide transcription and development services, and we also have a large number of employees in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom who provide professional services. We conduct a significant portion of the development of our voice recognition and natural language understanding solutions in Canada and Germany. We also have significant research and development resources in Austria, Belgium, Italy, and the United Kingdom. We are exposed to fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies including the Euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Indian rupee. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors associated with international sales and operations, including:\n\u2022adverse political and economic conditions, or changes to such conditions, in a specific region or country;\n\u2022trade protection measures, including tariffs and import/export controls, imposed by the United States and/or by other countries or regional authorities such as Canada or the European Union;\n\u2022the impact on local and global economies of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union;\n\u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the lack of ability to hedge certain foreign currencies;\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations in many countries and any subsequent changes in such laws and regulations;\n\u2022geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war;\n\u2022changing data privacy regulations and customer requirements to locate data centers in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022evolving restrictions on cross-border investment, including recent enhancements to the oversight by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States pursuant to the Foreign Investment Risk Preview Modernization Act;\n\u2022changes in applicable tax laws;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries;\n\u2022longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions; and\n\u2022less effective protection of intellectual property outside the United States.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be harmed.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. If any of our key employees were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Although we have arrangements with some of our executive officers designed to promote retention, our employment relationships are generally at-will and we have had key employees leave in the past. We cannot assure you that one or more key employees will not leave in the future. In particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software, as well as for skilled information technology, marketing, sales and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In particular, we have experienced a competitive hiring environment in the Greater Boston area, where we are headquartered. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. If the price of our stock declines, or experiences significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees will be adversely affected. We intend to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel, including research and development and operational personnel, but may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future. Any failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain these employees could harm our business.\nCybersecurity and data privacy incidents or breaches may damage client relations and inhibit our growth.\nThe confidentiality and security of our information, and that of third parties, is critical to our business. Our services involve the transmission, use, and storage of our customers\u2019 and their customers' confidential information. We were the victim of a cybercrime in 2017, and future cybersecurity or data privacy incidents could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. While we maintain a broad array of information security and privacy measures, policies and practices, our networks may be breached through a variety of means, resulting in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our information, to information of our customers or their customers, or to our intellectual property; disabling or degrading service; or sabotaging systems or information. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors, and vendors. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We will continue to incur significant costs to continuously enhance our information security measures to defend against the threat of cybercrime. Any cybersecurity or data privacy incident or breach may result in:\n\u2022loss of revenue resulting from the operational disruption;\n\u2022loss of revenue or increased bad debt expense due to the inability to invoice properly or to customer dissatisfaction resulting in collection issues;\n\u2022loss of revenue due to loss of customers;\n\u2022material remediation costs to restore systems;\n\u2022material investments in new or enhanced systems in order to enhance our information security posture;\n\u2022cost of incentives offered to customers to restore confidence and maintain business relationships;\n\u2022reputational damage resulting in the failure to retain or attract customers;\n\u2022costs associated with potential litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u2022costs associated with any required notices of a data breach;\n\u2022costs associated with the potential loss of critical business data; and\n\u2022other consequences of which we are not currently aware but will discover through the remediation process.\nOur business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations including data protection, anticorruption and health care reimbursement.\nWe must comply with, numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters such as data privacy and protection, anticorruption, employment and labor relations, tax, foreign currency, anti-competition, import/export controls, trade regulations, immigration, anti-kickback laws and healthcare reimbursement laws. The global nature of our operations increases the difficulty of compliance. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these laws in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business, breach of contract damages and harm to our reputation.\nIn particular, we are subject to a complex array of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and personal health information, with additional laws applicable in some jurisdictions depending on the type of data collected or where the information is collected from children. In many cases, these laws apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between us and our subsidiaries. Many of the laws passed in this area are relatively new and their interpretation is evolving and changing. In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA imposes privacy and data security obligations on companies and provides California consumers with certain rights as data subjects. Several other U.S. states have proposed data privacy laws that impose similar but non-identical obligations. In addition, some states have passed laws imposing increased data security and breach notification obligations on companies operating in the U.S. In the EU, the European General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, imposes privacy and data security compliance obligations and significant penalties for noncompliance. The GDPR presents numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the EU, including rights guaranteed to data subjects, requirements for data portability for EU consumers, data breach notification requirements and significant fines for noncompliance. In GDPR enforcement matters, companies have faced fines for violations of certain provisions. Fines can reach as high as 4% of a company\u2019s annual total revenue, potentially including the revenue of a company\u2019s international affiliates. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision that invalidates the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, a mechanism that companies had previously relied on to transfer information between the EU and U.S., on the basis that such transfer mechanism does not comply with the level of protection required under the GDPR. There is also an increase in regulation of biometric data globally, which may include voiceprints. In addition, we are subject to laws relating specifically to personal health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") and HITECH Act.\nChanges in these data privacy and protection laws and regulations and inconsistencies in the standards that apply to our business in different jurisdictions may impose significant compliance costs, reduce the efficiency of our operations, expose us to enforcement risks, and materially adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and solutions. Any alleged or actual failure by us, our customers, suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could cause our customers to lose confidence in our solutions; harm our reputation; expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations and to resulting liabilities including reimbursement of customer costs, damages penalties or fines imposed by regulatory agencies, and require us to incur significant expenses for remediation.\nWe are also subject to a variety of anticorruption laws in respect of our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and regulations issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and various other foreign governmental agencies. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing\nlaws might be administered or interpreted. Actual or alleged violations of these laws and regulations could lead to enforcement actions and financial penalties that could result in substantial costs.\nMany of our customers are subject to various federal and state laws concerning their submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act (the \u201cFalse Claims Act\u201d), the federal anti-kickback statute, state false claims acts and anti-kickback statutes in most states, the federal \u201cStark Law\u201d and related state laws. In particular, the False Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or knowingly and improperly failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs and can be used as a vehicle to enforce each of these other laws. Claims under federal and state false claims acts can be brought by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d suit. If there is an adverse decision against us or our customers under these laws relating to use of our products or solutions, we may be required to pay damages, significant fines and/or other monetary penalties, and our ability to market and sell such products or solutions to customers may be materially adversely impacted.\nInterruptions or delays in our services, including from data center hosting facilities, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nBecause our services are complex and incorporate a variety of third-party hardware and software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm to our reputation and our business. We have from time to time, found defects in our services, and new errors in our services may be detected in the future. In addition, we currently serve our customers from data center hosting facilities we directly manage and from third party public cloud facilities. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems that serve our customers in whole or in part could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay service-level agreement penalties, cause customers to terminate their on-demand services, and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers.\nWe may be unable to fully capture the expected value from strategic transactions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have in the past acquired and divested, and expect to continue to acquire and may divest, other businesses and technologies. We also expect to from time to time pursue other strategic transactions including divestitures, joint ventures, minority stakes and strategic alliances. Our acquisitions and divestitures have required substantial integration and management efforts, and we expect future acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions to require similar efforts. Successfully realizing the benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022difficulty in transitioning and integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022difficulty in separating the operations, personnel and systems of divested businesses:\n\u2022potential negative impact on our profitability as a result of losses that may result from a divestiture, including the loss of sales and operating income or decrease in cash flows;\n\u2022retained exposure on financial guarantee leases, real estate and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations of divested business, and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer;\n\u2022potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022difficulty in incorporating acquired products and technologies into our products and technologies;\n\u2022potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development;\n\u2022unanticipated expenses and delays in completing acquired development projects and technology integration and upgrades;\n\u2022challenges associated with managing additional, geographically remote businesses;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with partners and customers;\n\u2022assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies;\n\u2022the accuracy of revenue and bookings projections of acquired companies;\n\u2022customers delaying purchases of our products pending resolution of product integration between our existing and our newly acquired products;\n\u2022entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited experience; and\n\u2022potential loss of key employees of the acquired business or loss of key employees of a divested business.\nAs a result of these and other risks, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. Any failure to achieve these benefits or failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or disaggregate divested businesses and technologies could seriously harm our business.\nCharges to earnings as a result of our acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results in the foreseeable future, which could have a material and adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we record the market value of our common stock and other forms of consideration issued in connection with an acquisition as the cost of acquiring the company or business. We allocate that cost to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology, acquired trade names and acquired customer relationships, based on their respective fair values. We base our estimates of fair value upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows:\n\u2022costs incurred to integrate the operations of businesses we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or relocation expenses;\n\u2022impairment of goodwill or intangible assets;\n\u2022amortization of intangible assets acquired;\n\u2022a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;\n\u2022identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and non-income tax related, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first;\n\u2022charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure;\n\u2022charges to our operating results arising from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and\n\u2022charges to our operating results due to the expensing of stock awards assumed in acquisitions.\nIntangible assets are generally amortized over three to ten years. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to an impairment analysis, at least annually, which may result in an impairment charge if the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. As of September 30, 2021, we recorded goodwill of $2,155.3 million and intangible assets of $128.3 million, net of accumulated amortization and impairment charges. In addition, purchase accounting limits our ability to recognize certain revenue that otherwise would have been recognized by the acquired company as an independent business. As a result, the combined company may delay revenue recognition or recognize less revenue than we and the acquired company would have recognized as independent companies.\nImpairment of our intangible assets could result in significant charges that would adversely impact our future operating results.\nWe have significant intangible assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. The most significant intangible assets are customer relationships, patents and core technologies, technologies and trademarks. Customer relationships are amortized on an accelerated basis based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of customer relationships are being utilized. Other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We assess the potential impairment of intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment of such assets include the following:\n\u2022significant adjustments to our multi-year operating plans, in connection with our ongoing portfolio review;\n\u2022changes in our organization or management reporting structure that could result in additional reporting units, which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit;\n\u2022significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n\u2022significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n\u2022significant negative industry or economic trends;\n\u2022significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and\n\u2022our market capitalization declining to below net book value.\nFuture adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would impact our results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.\nWe have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions, which could dilute our existing stockholders and/or increase our debt levels.\nIn connection with past acquisitions, we have in the past issued a substantial number of shares of our common stock as transaction consideration, including contingent consideration, and also incurred significant debt to finance the cash consideration used for our acquisitions. We may continue to issue equity securities for future acquisitions, which would dilute existing stockholders, perhaps significantly, depending on the terms of such acquisitions. We may also incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions, which, if available at all, may place additional restrictions on our ability to operate our business.\nOur strategy to transition to cloud-based recurring revenue may adversely affect our near-term revenue growth and results of operations.\nWe expect our ongoing shift from a software license model to cloud-based services revenue models to create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable. The transition, however, creates risks related to the timing of revenue recognition. We also incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures and selling efforts of our hosting offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings, which may adversely affect our near-term reported revenues, results of operations and cash flows. A decline in renewals of recurring revenue offerings in any period may not be immediately reflected in our results for that period but may result in a decline in our revenue and results of operations in future quarters.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and may incur losses in the future, which may require us to raise additional capital on unfavorable terms.\nWe had a total accumulated deficit of $298.9 million and $272.2 million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If we are unable to return to and sustain our profitability, the market price for our stock may decline, perhaps substantially. We cannot assure you that our revenue or bookings will grow or that we will sustain profitability in the future. If we do not achieve profitability, we may be required to raise additional capital to maintain or grow our operations. Additional capital, if available at all, may be highly dilutive to existing investors or contain other unfavorable terms, such as a high interest rate and restrictive covenants.\nTax matters may cause significant variability in our financial results.\nOur businesses are subject to income taxation in the United States, as well as in many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. If our effective tax rate increases, our operating results and cash flow could be adversely affected. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments can vary significantly between periods due to a number of complex factors including:\n\u2022projected levels of taxable income;\n\u2022pre-tax income being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory rates or higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory rates;\n\u2022increases or decreases to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets;\n\u2022tax audits conducted and settled by various tax authorities, either through administrative appeals, litigation or other dispute resolution methods;\n\u2022adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of income tax returns;\n\u2022the ability to claim foreign tax credits;\n\u2022the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for income taxes; and\n\u2022changes in tax laws and their interpretations in countries in which we are subject to taxation.\nIn December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. We expect this to continue having a material impact on our tax financial results under United States generally accepted accounting principles. Future changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations could have a material effect on our results of operations in the periods in which such laws and regulations become effective as well as in future periods. In the United States, such law changes could include new tax revenue raising provisions tied to the proposed \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d Act which is currently under consideration in Congress. Globally, the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit shifting is advancing fundamental changes to the international corporate tax system creating new rules for the allocation of rights to tax global income and a global minimum tax.\nThe failure to successfully maintain the adequacy of our system of internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on our ability to report our financial results in an accurate and timely manner.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we were required to develop and are required to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. In addition, our management is required to assess and certify the adequacy of our controls on a quarterly basis, and our independent auditors must attest and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. Any failure in the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on our ability to report our financial statements in an accurate and timely manner. Inaccurate and/or untimely financial statements could subject us to regulatory actions, civil or criminal penalties, stockholder litigation, or loss of customer confidence, which could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace and ultimately could negatively impact our stock price due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nOur sales to government clients subject us to risks, including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues and bookings from arrangements with governmental users in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere, contracts with the government in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere, as well as various state and local governments, and their respective agencies. Government contracts are generally subject to oversight, including audits and investigations which could identify violations of these agreements. Government contract violations could result in a range of consequences including, but not limited to, contract price adjustments, civil and criminal penalties, contract termination, forfeiture of profit and/or suspension of payment, and suspension or debarment from future government contracts. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation if we were found to have violated the terms of our government contracts.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger may result in disruptions to our business.\nOn April 11, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Microsoft, pursuant to which we will be acquired by Microsoft in an all-cash transaction. The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger and restricts us, without Microsoft\u2019s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, in connection with the pending Merger, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the Merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the Merger, and may depart prior to the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past.\nThe proposed Merger further could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nThe pursuit of the Merger may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. It may also divert management\u2019s time and attention from the day-to-day operation of our remaining businesses and the execution of our other\nstrategic initiatives. This could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur other significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the pending Merger is consummated.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations and prospects.\nThe Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed in the expected timeframe, or at all. The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger, including, among others, the approval or clearance of the Merger under the antitrust and foreign investment laws of certain specified countries. There can be no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals or that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, as applicable). Even if regulatory approval is obtained, it is possible conditions will be imposed that could result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger or otherwise have an adverse effect on us.\nIf the Merger is not completed within the expected timeframe or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. In addition, some costs related to the Merger must be paid whether or not the Merger is completed, and we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed transaction, as well as the diversion of management and resources towards the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if completion of the Merger does not occur. We may also experience negative reactions from our investors, customers, partners, suppliers, and employees. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $515.0 million.\nStockholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the pending Merger or otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any future stockholder litigation in connection with the pending Merger. Such litigation may adversely affect our ability to complete the pending Merger. We could incur significant costs in connection with any such litigation, including costs associated with the indemnification of obligations to our directors.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology\nThird parties have claimed and may claim in the future that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could be exposed to significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products if such claims are successful.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to claims and legal actions alleging that we or our customers may be infringing or contributing to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technologies and products. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses from some or all claimants, the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us, and we may not be able to resolve disputes without litigation. Any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments to our customers. Any of these could seriously harm our business.\nUnauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur success and competitive position depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights protecting our products and services. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets,\nconfidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or discover aspects of our products or to obtain, license, sell or otherwise use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially the same or superior to our technologies and that do not infringe our rights. In these cases, we would be unable to prevent our competitors from selling or licensing these similar or superior technologies. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Although the source code for our proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, can be very expensive and can divert management efforts.\nOur software products may have bugs, which could result in delayed or lost revenue and bookings, expensive correction, liability to our customers and claims against us.\nComplex software products such as ours may contain errors, defects or bugs. Defects in the solutions or products that we develop and sell to our customers could require expensive corrections and result in delayed or lost revenue and bookings, adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services. Customers who are not satisfied with any of our products may also bring claims against us for damages, which, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming to defend, and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages. Such claims could harm our reputation, financial results and competitive position.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness, Investments and Common Stock\nOur debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur debt agreements contain, and any of our other future debt agreements or arrangements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt or issue guarantees;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders; and\n\u2022merge or consolidate with any entity.\nOur ability to comply with these limitations is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. As a result of these limitations, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be significantly restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay the accelerated debt.\nOur significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our credit facility and our convertible debentures.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. As of September 30, 2021, we had $918.0 million outstanding principal of debt, including $500.0 million of senior notes due in 2026, $25.1 million of 1.5% 2035 Convertible Debentures redeemable in November 2021, $130.3 million of 1.0% 2035 Convertible Debentures redeemable in December 2022, and $262.6 million of 1.25% 2025 Convertible Debentures redeemable in April 2025. Investors may require us to redeem these convertible debentures earlier than the dates indicated if the closing sale price of our common stock is more than 130% of the then current conversion price of the respective debentures for certain specified periods. If a holder elects to convert, we will be required to pay the principal amount in cash and any amounts payable in excess of the principal amount in cash or shares of our common stock, at\nour election. For example, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, holders of $118.3 million of our 1.5% 2035 Convertible Debentures exercised their rights to require us to repurchase such debentures. We also have a $300.0 million Revolving Credit Facility under which $1.9 million was committed to backing outstanding letters of credit issued and $298.1 million was available for borrowing at September 30, 2021. Our debt level could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, including the convertible debentures and the credit facility, which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development, exploit business opportunities, and undertake other business activities;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants related to our debt, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends.\nOur ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the convertible debentures and our other debt and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the convertible debentures, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the convertible debentures and our other debt.\nCurrent uncertainty in the global financial markets and the global economy may negatively affect the value of our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolios, which include investments in money market funds, bank deposits and separately managed investment portfolios, are generally subject to credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by a global financial crisis or by uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union or recent changes in tariffs and trade agreements. If the banking system or the fixed income, credit or equity markets deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted, and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations, and this may make it difficult for our stockholders to resell the common stock when they want or at prices they find attractive.\nOur stock price historically has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Various factors contribute to the volatility of our stock price, including, for example, the status of the potential Merger, quarterly variations in our financial results, new product introductions by us or our competitors and general economic and market conditions. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our largest stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur, could also contribute to the volatility or our stock price. While we cannot predict the individual effect that any of these factors may have on the market price of our common stock, these factors, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in significant volatility in our stock price. Moreover, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock may be subject to securities class action litigation. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.\nFuture issuances of our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nFuture issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock, whether in the public market or through private placements, including issuances in connection with acquisition activities, or the perception that such issuances could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. In connection with past acquisitions, we issued a substantial number of shares of our common stock as transaction consideration or contingent consideration. We may continue to issue equity securities for future acquisitions, which would dilute existing stockholders, perhaps significantly depending on the terms of such acquisitions. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of common stock, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, will have on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur business could be negatively affected by the actions of activist stockholders.\nIn the past, certain stockholders have publicly and privately expressed concerns with our performance and with certain governance matters. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Furthermore, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. In addition, we have enacted certain changes to our bylaws in the past year that may weaken our ability to prevent an unsolicited takeover.", "PERMNO": 82759, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "NUAN"}
