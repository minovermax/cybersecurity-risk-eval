RISK FACTORS.\nWe caution readers that the following important factors, among others, could affect our financial condition, operating results, business prospects or any other aspect of NVE, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from that projected or estimated by us in the forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Although we have attempted to list below the important factors that do or may affect our financial condition, operating results, business prospects, or any other aspect of NVE, other factors may in the future prove to be more important. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Similarly, we cannot necessarily assess or quantify the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe may lose revenue if any of our large customers cancel, postpone, or reduce their purchases.\nWe rely on several large customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. These large customers include Abbott Laboratories, Sonova AG, certain other medical device manufacturers, and certain distributors. Although we have agreements with certain large customers, these agreements do not obligate customers to purchase from us and may not prevent price reductions. Furthermore, orders from our large customers can generally be reduced, postponed, or canceled, and some orders were delayed or canceled due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any decreases in purchases, or the loss of any of our large customers, could have a significant impact on our revenue and our profitability.\nWe risk losing business to our competitors.\nWe have a number of competitors and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than us. We believe that our competition is increasing as the technology and markets mature. This has meant more competitors and more severe pricing pressure. In addition, our competitors may be narrowing or eliminating our performance advantages. We expect these trends to continue, and we may lose business to competitors or it may be necessary to significantly reduce our prices in order to acquire or retain business. These factors could cause a material adverse impact on our financial condition, revenue, gross profit margins, or income.\nFailure to meet stringent customer requirements could result in the loss of key customers and reduce our sales.\nSome of our customers, including certain medical device manufacturers, have stringent technical and quality requirements that require our products to meet certain test and qualification criteria or to adopt and comply with specific quality standards. Certain customers also periodically audit our performance. Failure to meet technical or quality requirements or a negative customer audit could result in the loss of current sales revenue, customers, and future sales.\nWe may lose revenue if we are unable to renew customer agreements.\nWe have agreements with certain customers, including a Supplier Partnering Agreement, as amended, with Abbott Laboratories, which expires November 30, 2021, and Supply Agreement, as amended, with Sonova AG, which expires March 31, 2025. We cannot predict if these agreements will be renewed, or if renewed, under what terms. Although it is possible we could continue to sell products to these customers without formal agreements, an inability to agree on mutually acceptable terms or the loss of these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and our profitability.\nChanges in tax law, in our tax rates or in exposure to additional income tax liabilities may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in law and policy relating to taxes may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Federal Tax Reform Act significantly decreased our Federal income tax rate. The current administration and Congress could make changes to existing tax law such as an increase in the corporate tax rate. Changes to existing Federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will lose revenue if government contract funding is reduced, delayed, or eliminated.\nA decrease in U.S. Government funded research or disqualification as a vendor to the U.S. Government for any reason could hamper future research and development activity and decrease related revenue. In addition to direct Government funding, certain of our non-Government customers and prospective customers depend on Government support to fund their contracts with us. Our direct and indirect Government funding depends on adequate continued funding of the agencies and their programs. Such funding is subject to the availability of Congressional appropriations and that, as a result, long-term government contracts are partially funded initially with additional funds committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. Certain contracts require us to maintain facilities and personnel security clearances to protect classified information. Such clearances are subject Government audits and investigations, and any deficiencies or illegal activities identified during the audits or investigations could result in the forfeiture or suspension of payments and civil or criminal penalties. Furthermore, some of our Government funding has been through Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) contracts. SBIR and STTR budgets, eligibility, or funding limits may be changed by legislation or by agencies such as the Department of Defense.\nIf we were barred for any reason from U.S. government contracts there could be a significant adverse impact on our revenue and our ability to make research and development progress.\nIf we were to be charged with violation of certain laws or if the U.S. Government were to determine that we are not a \u201cpresently responsible contractor,\u201d we could be temporarily suspended or, in the event of a violation, barred for up to three years from receiving new U.S. Government contracts or government-approved subcontracts. Additionally, we are subject to routine government audits and may be subject to investigations, and any deficiencies or illegal activities identified during the audits or investigations may result in the forfeiture or suspension of payments and civil or criminal penalties. Being barred for any reason from U.S. Government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profits, and research and development efforts.\nSome of our products are incorporated into medical devices, which could expose us to a risk of product liability claims and such claims could seriously harm our business and financial condition.\nCertain of our products are used in medical devices, including devices that help sustain human life. We are also marketing our technology to other manufacturers of cardiac pacemakers and ICDs. Although we have indemnification agreements with certain customers including provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses resulting from bodily injury or property damage arising from the incorporation of our products in devices sold by our customers. Our indemnifying customers may not have the financial resources to cover all liability. Existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions of our indemnification agreements, or the agreements may not be enforceable in all instances. A successful product liability claim could require us to pay, or contribute to payment of, substantial damage awards, which would have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may lose revenue if we are unable to maintain important certifications.\nOur quality management system is certified to the ISO 9001 standard, and we have received a letter of conformance for the International Automotive Task Force (IATF) 16949 automotive sector-specific standard. Our products are also subject to independent certification and listings including by the VDE Institute and UL LLC. These certifications are subject to a number of rigorous conditions. Failure to achieve or maintain any of these certifications or listings could cause us to be disqualified by one or more of our customers, and could have a material adverse impact on our business and revenue.\nFederal legislation may not protect us against liability for the use of our products in medical devices and a successful liability claim could seriously harm our business and financial condition.\nAlthough the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1998 may provide us some protection against potential liability claims, that Act includes significant exceptions to supplier immunity provisions, including limitations relating to negligence or willful misconduct. A successful product liability claim could require us to pay, or contribute to payment of, substantial damage awards, which would have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition. Any product liability claim against us, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, divert the time, attention, and resources of our management and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe malfunction of our products in medical devices could lead to the need to recall devices incorporating our products from the market, which may be harmful to our reputation and cause a significant loss of revenue.\nThe malfunction of our products that are incorporated in medical devices could lead to the recall of existing medical devices incorporating our products. Such a recall could be harmful to our reputation for product safety and efficacy. Even if assertions that our products caused or contributed to device failure do not lead to product liability or contract claims, such assertions could harm our reputation and customer relationships. Any damage to our reputation and/or the reputation of our products, or the reputation of our customers or their products could limit the market for our and our customers\u2019 products and harm our results of operations.\nWe may lose business and revenue if our critical production equipment fails.\nOur production process relies on certain critical pieces of equipment for defining, depositing, and modifying the magnetic properties of thin films. Some of this equipment was designed or customized by us, and some may no longer be in production. While we have an in-house maintenance staff, maintenance agreements for certain equipment, some critical spare parts, and back-ups for some of the equipment, we cannot be sure we could repair or replace critical manufacturing equipment were it to fail.\nThe loss of supply from any of our key single-source wafer suppliers could substantially impact our ability to produce and deliver products and seriously harm our business and financial condition.\nOur critical suppliers include suppliers of certain raw silicon and semiconductor foundry wafers that are incorporated in our products. We maintain inventory of some critical wafers, but we have not identified or qualified alternate suppliers for many of the wafers now being obtained from single sources. In the past fiscal year there have been industry-wide semiconductor wafer shortages and leadtimes have increased for certain of our foundry wafers. Wafer supply interruptions for any reason, including acts of God such as floods, typhoons, cyclones, earthquakes, or pandemics could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to our business and operations, and may cause us to lose revenue.\nThe loss of supply of any critical chemicals or supplies could impact our ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue.\nThere are a number of critical chemicals and supplies that we require to make products. These include certain gases, photoresists, polymers, metals, and specialized alloys. We maintain inventory of critical chemicals and materials, but in many cases we are dependent on single sources, and some of the materials could be subject to shortages or be discontinued by their suppliers at any time. Supply interruptions or shortages for any reason could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to our business and operations and may cause us to lose revenue.\nThe loss of supply from any of our packaging vendors could impact our ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue.\nWe are dependent on our packaging vendors. Because of the unique materials our products use, the complexity of some of our products, unique magnetic requirements, and high isolation voltage specifications, many of our products are more challenging to package than conventional integrated circuits. Some of our products use processes or tooling unique to a particular packaging vendor, and it might be expensive, time-consuming, or impractical to convert to another vendor in the event of a supply interruption due to vendors\u2019 business decisions, business condition, or acts of God, including floods, typhoons, earthquakes, or pandemics. Leadtimes for packaging services have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and there have been shortages of raw materials and equipment our packaging vendors need for their process. One of our packaging vendors in India was forced to suspend its factory operations from late March 2020 until mid-May 2020 and was permitted only limited operation from mid-May through August 2020 pursuant to COVID-19 government orders, and is still not fully operational. Restrictions on our packaging vendors could be reimposed in the future. Additionally, certain of our packaging vendors are in flood-susceptible areas. Flooding risks to such vendors may increase in the future due to possible higher ocean levels, extreme weather, and other potential effects of climate change. We have alternate vendors or potential alternate vendors for the majority of our products, but it can be expensive, time-consuming, and technically challenging to convert to alternate vendors. Furthermore, we may not be able to recover work in process or finished goods at a packaging vendor in the event of a disruption. Any supply interruptions or loss of inventory could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to our business and operations and may cause us to lose revenue.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries that could impair our results of operations.\nForeign sales are a significant portion of our revenue and we rely on suppliers in China, India, Taiwan, Thailand, and other foreign countries. Risks relating to operating in foreign markets that could impair our results of operations include economic and political instability; acts of God, including floods, typhoons, cyclones and earthquakes; public health crises including, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic; difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, customs, duties, and other trade barriers; transportation delays; and other uncertainties relating to the administration of, or changes in, or new interpretation of, the laws, regulations, and policies of jurisdictions where we do business.\nPublic health crises could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nPublic health crises could adversely affect our ongoing business operations. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, caused many of our important customers to delay or cancel orders, and disrupted our supply chains. Any customer or supplier disruptions could affect our ability to operate. These and other impacts of COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property by seeking patents, trademarks, and copyrights, and by maintaining trade secrets through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, suppliers, customers, and prospective customers depending on the circumstances. We hold patents or are the licensee of others owning patented technology covering certain aspects of our products and technology. These patent rights may be challenged, rendered unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented. Additionally, rights granted under the patents or under licensing agreements may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Efforts to enforce patent rights can involve substantial expense and may not be successful. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar, superior, or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us, or our technology may prove to infringe on patents or rights owned by others. Thus the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage. Also, our confidentiality agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information. Our inability to maintain our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business success may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees.\nWe have employment agreements with certain employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, but those agreements do not prevent employees from leaving the company. Competition for highly qualified management and technical personnel can be intense and we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of our business. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events or information technology disruptions.\nWe face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, and denial-of-service attacks. Additionally, there is a risk of disruptions due to failures of our information technology infrastructure or service provider outages. We maintain policies and procedures for the mitigation of information technology risks, and we maintain data backups, backup hardware, and some redundant systems. We have experienced cyber security events and disruptions such as viruses, ransomware, hacker attacks, and limited server, Website, and e-mail outages. Although these events did not materially impact our business, future events could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to liability, compromise our eligibility for research and development contracts involving sensitive or classified information, or have other effects including unpredictable effects.\nWe could incur losses on our marketable securities.\nAs of March 31, 2021, we held $54,717,626 in short-term and long-term marketable securities, representing approximately 75% of our total assets. Conditions and circumstances beyond our control or ability to anticipate, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause downgrades and increased default risk, and such downgrades or increases in default risk are possible at any time. Additionally, the assignment of a high credit rating does not preclude the risk of default on any marketable security. Defaults, default risks, or changes in market conditions could cause us to incur losses on our marketable securities, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, income, or cash flows, and our ability to pay dividends.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nWe face an uncertain economic environment in the industries we serve, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe sell our products into the semiconductor market, which is highly cyclical. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the industries we serve. The economic environment could have a material adverse impact on our business and revenue.\nOur business and our reliance on intellectual property exposes us to litigation risks.\nIf patent infringement claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology. Such licenses or design modifications can be costly or could increase the cost of our products. In addition, we may decide to settle a claim or action against us, which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for any past infringement, and we may be required to indemnify our customers against expenses relating to possible infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product. It could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement, treble damages. Any of these results would increase our costs or harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to our Stock\nAny decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nFuture dividends will be subject to Board approval and will take into account factors including our results of operations, cash and marketable security balances, the timing of securities maturations, estimates of future cash requirements, fixed asset requirements, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors our Board may deem relevant. Because they are generally more than our current cash flow from operations, recent and declared dividend amounts may be unsustainable. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may be adversely affected by significant price fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nFrom time to time our stock price has decreased sharply, and could decline in the future. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 the announcement of new products, product enhancements, or contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 delays in our introduction of new products or technologies or market acceptance of these products or technologies;\n\u2022 loss of customers, decreases in customers\u2019 purchases, or decreases in customers\u2019 purchase prices;\n\u2022 changes in demand for our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022 quarterly variations in our financial results, revenue, or revenue growth rates;\n\u2022 speculation in the press or analyst community about our business, potential revenue, or potential earnings;\n\u2022 general economic conditions or market conditions specific to industries we or our customers serve or may serve;\n\u2022 legal proceedings involving us, including intellectual property litigation or class action litigation;\n\u2022 changes in Federal corporate income tax rates or changes in other tax provisions;\n\u2022 changes in tariffs, customs, duties, or other trade barriers in foreign jurisdictions where we purchase raw materials or sell our products;\n\u2022 the impact or perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general economic conditions, our industry, or our revenues or net income;\n\u2022 our stock repurchase and dividend policies and decisions.", "PERMNO": 89655, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "NVEC"}
