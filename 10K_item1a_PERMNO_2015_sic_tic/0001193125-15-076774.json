RISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking information based on our current expectations. Because our business is subject to many risks and our actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us, this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our other publicly available filings with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are involved in litigation with respect to certain patents on our product RAVICTI, which we expect will be costly and time-consuming and the outcome of which is uncertain.\nOn March 17, 2014, we received notice from Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., the generic drug manufacturer that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval for a generic version of our product RAVICTI. The ANDA contained what is known as a \u201cParagraph IV certification.\u201d The Paragraph IV certification alleges that two of our patents covering RAVICTI, U.S. Patent No. 8,404,215, titled \u201cMethods of therapeutic monitoring of nitrogen scavenging drugs,\u201d which expires in March 2032, and U.S. Patent No. 8,642,012, titled \u201cMethods of treatment using ammonia scavenging drugs,\u201d which expires in September 2030, are invalid and/or will not be infringed by Par\u2019s manufacture, use or sale of the product for which the ANDA was submitted. Par did not challenge the validity, enforceability, or infringement of our primary composition of matter patent for RAVICTI, U.S. Patent No. 5,968,979 titled \u201cTriglycerides and ethyl esters of phenylalkanoic acid and phenylalkenoic acid useful in treatment of various disorders,\u201d which would have expired on February 7, 2015, but as to which we have been granted an interim term of extension until February 7, 2016. Upon notice of the Paragraph IV certification, we had 45 days to file suit to protect our patents in order to obtain a stay of the FDA\u2019s approval of PAR\u2019s ANDA for 30 months, or as lengthened or shortened by the court.\nWe filed suit against Par on April 23, 2014 and intend to vigorously protect our patents. However, we cannot predict the outcome of this or any litigation. If Par were to prevail and its ANDA were to receive FDA approval, RAVICTI would face generic competition when its orphan exclusivity expires in February 2020, and its sales would likely materially decline. Should sales decline, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Even if we successfully defend our patents against Par\u2019s challenge, the litigation will be costly and time consuming and will require substantial time and attention from our management team, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be sued by others who hold intellectual property rights who claim that their issued patents are infringed by RAVICTI, BUPHENYL or any of our future products or product candidates. Our patents and patent applications, or those of our licensors, could also face other challenges, such as interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, and re-examination proceedings. Any of these lawsuits and challenges, if successful, could result in the invalidation of, or in a narrowing of the scope of, any of our patents and patent applications subject to the suit or challenge. Any of these, regardless of their success, would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and would divert our management\u2019s time and attention.\nOur intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity may not protect against competitors entering the market, including with generic versions of our products, and sales of affected products may decline materially.\nWe may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for products we currently market or for products and technologies we develop or license or the patent protection we procure may not adequately protect our technology, as its scope may be limited.\nOur composition of matter patent covering RAVICTI would have expired in the United States in February 2015 without term extension. However, we have applied for a term extension of approximately four years for this patent under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (the \u201cHatch-Waxman Act\u201d). We recently received notice that we have been granted an interim extension of this patent\u2019s term through February 7, 2016 while the United States Patent and Trademark Office makes a final determination as to the length of the extension. We cannot be certain that we will be granted the full four year term of extension for which we have applied, or that we will receive any extension beyond the one year interim extension.\nWe own a first family of patents and pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada directed to methods of using, administering, and adjusting the effective dosage of phenylacetic acid (\u201cPAA\u201d) prodrugs including RAVICTI based on urinary phenylacetylglutamine (\u201cPAGN\u201d) levels. This family includes one issued United States patent, U.S. Patent No. 8,642,012, which expires September 2030 due to a 623 day Patent Term Adjustment and which is a subject of our litigation with Par. Par challenges the validity and/or enforceability of this patent and asserts that the generic product for which it is seeking FDA approval does not infringe our patents. Any subsequent patents issued within this family may also be subject to challenge by competitors and invalidated or deemed not to be infringed by competing products. The base expiration date of any patents issuing from this family will be January 2029.\nWe own a second family of patents and pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, and 15 additional countries directed to methods of using, administering, and adjusting the effective dosage of PAA prodrugs, including RAVICTI, based on fasting ammonia levels. This family includes one issued United States patent, U.S. Patent No. 8,404,215, which is a subject of our litigation with Par. Par challenges the validity and/or enforceability of this patent and asserts that the generic product for which it is seeking FDA approval does not infringe our patents. Any subsequent patents issued within this family may also be subject to challenge by competitors and invalidated or deemed not to be infringed by competing products. The base expiration date of any patents issuing from this family will be March 2032.\nWe own a third family of pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, and ten additional countries directed to methods of using, administering, and adjusting the effective dosage of PAA prodrugs, including RAVICTI, based on PAA:PAGN ratio. The base expiration date of any patents issuing from this family will be September 2032.\nWe own a fourth family of pending patent applications in the United States and internationally pursuant to the PCT that pertain to methods for treating UCD and determining dosage of nitrogen scavenging drugs, including BUPHENYL and RAVICTI, based on body surface area, and methods of evaluating compliance with nitrogen scavenging drug treatment regimens based in part on analysis of urinary PAGN levels. Any patents issuing from this family of applications will expire in October 2034.\nWe own two additional families of pending patent applications in the United States and internationally pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (\u201cPCT\u201d) that pertain to methods of optimizing the dosage of a PAA prodrug, including RAVICTI, for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (\u201cHE\u201d), methods of diagnosing, grading, and treating HE, and methods of evaluating PAA prodrug treatment compliance. If granted, these applications could extend patent protection until November 2033 to September 2034. We also own a pending provisional patent application in the United States that pertains to methods of preventing hyperammonemic crises (HACs) and optimizing the dosage of nitrogen scavenging drugs, including BUPHENYL and RAVICTI, for\npreventing HACs, based in part on fasting ammonia levels. Any patents arising from a nonprovisional application claiming priority to this provisional would expire in 2035.\nThere is a significant risk that the pending patent applications in the seven families discussed above will not issue on a timely basis, or at all. In particular, claims directed to dosing and dose adjustment may be substantially less likely to issue in light of the Supreme Court decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. Further, any patents issuing from these applications could be vulnerable to future validity challenges based on Mayo and subsequent court decisions that further clarify the scope of Mayo. In Mayo, the Court held that claims directed to methods of determining whether to adjust drug dosing levels based on drug metabolite levels in the red blood cells were not patent eligible because they were directed to a law of nature. This decision may have wide-ranging implications on the validity and scope of pharmaceutical method claims and may affect the outcome of our litigation with Par, although its full impact will not be known for many years. Moreover, even if granted, these applications may not provide protection sufficient to protect against the introduction to the market of generic forms of RAVICTI. The entry of generic competitors to the market would likely result in a material decline in sales of RAVICTI.\nEven if our patent applications do not issue or our patents are invalidated or become unenforceable, we still may have protection under two different forms of regulatory exclusivity. The first form, orphan drug exclusivity, prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same use for seven years from the date of approval. RAVICTI has orphan drug exclusivity for the treatment of UCD until February 2020.\nOrphan exclusivity will not, however, bar approval of another product under certain circumstances. One such circumstance is if a product with the same active ingredient is proven safe and effective for a different indication. Another circumstance is if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. FDA may also approve another product with the same active ingredient and the same indication if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease. All of the above circumstances could create a more competitive market for us.\nEven if patent protection and orphan drug exclusivity become unavailable, our products may still have limited protection against generic competition under a second form of regulatory exclusivity, which derives from the Hatch-Waxman Act. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an ANDA seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved innovator product once all patent protection for the approved product has expired or seeking immediate approval on the grounds that the applicable patents are invalid or unenforceable, as Par has done with respect to two of our patents on RAVICTI. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a manufacturer may also submit an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA that references the FDA\u2019s prior approval of the innovator product. A 505(b)(2) NDA product may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator product, but similarly is only available when no patent protection remains or the applicable patents are challenged or are not enforced. To maintain sufficient incentives for innovators to develop new drugs and to improve existing drugs, however, the Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity, which preclude FDA approval (or in some circumstances, FDA filing and reviewing) of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.\nRAVICTI was granted a three-year period of regulatory exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which expires on February 1, 2016. That exclusivity means that, even in the absence of any patent protection or orphan drug exclusivity, FDA could not grant final approval to an ANDA for a generic version of RAVICTI until February 1, 2016. The exclusivity also prohibits FDA from approving a 505(b)(2) NDA that references FDA\u2019s approval of RAVICTI or includes the same active ingredient and uses as RAVICTI.\nBUPHENYL\u2019s composition of matter patent protection and orphan drug exclusivity have expired. Because BUPHENYL has no regulatory exclusivity or listed patents, there is nothing to prevent a competitor from submitting an ANDA for a generic version of BUPHENYL and receiving FDA approval. For example, the FDA approved an ANDA for sodium phenylbutyrate, the active ingredient in BUPHENYL (\u201cNaPBA\u201d) powder in the first quarter of 2013, and the generic product was launched in April 2013. Lucane Pharma received marketing approval from the European Medicines Agency for taste-masked NaPBA and announced in January 2015 that it had also received marketing approval for taste-masked NaPBA granules in Canada. We believe Lucane is also seeking approval via an ANDA in the United States. We are also aware of an ANDA that was approved in November 2011 for NaPBA tablets. However, these tablets have not yet been made commercially available to UCD patients. Since the ANDA process is confidential if no Paragraph IV certifications are filed, there may be additional BUPHENYL ANDAs pending. Generic versions of BUPHENYL to date have been priced at a discount relative to BUPHENYL or RAVICTI, and physicians, patients, or payors may decide that this less expensive alternative is preferable to either of our drugs. If this occurs, our UCD product sales could be materially reduced, but we would nevertheless be required to make royalty payments to Ucyclyd and Brusilow at the same royalty rates.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our in-licensed patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our products.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our products infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe. Moreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. Because patents can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. For example, pending applications may exist that provide support or can be amended to provide support for a claim that results in an issued patent that our product infringes.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. If a court held that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and cover our products or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our products unless we obtained a license under\nthe applicable patents, or until the patents expire. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our products or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of products by us.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.\nRisks Related to our UCD products including Commercialization of RAVICTI\u00ae and Our Development Programs\nWe may never obtain approval for or commercialize RAVICTI outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to expand RAVICTI revenues and realize its full market potential.\nWe currently only have approval to market RAVICTI in the United States. In order to market RAVICTI outside of the United States, we must comply with regulatory requirements of and obtain required regulatory approvals in other countries. On June 25, 2014 the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) accepted our Marketing Authorisation Application, commencing its review process which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 or the first quarter of 2016. In addition, we announced on June 3, 2014 that Health Canada (\u201cHC\u201d) had completed its validation process for our New Drug Submission (\u201cNDS\u201d) for approval to market RAVICTI in Canada. In January 2015, Lucane announced that it had received approval from HC to market its taste-masked NaPBA granules in Canada. It is our understanding that in Canada only the first phenylbutyrate-containing product approved for any indication receives \u201cdata protection\u201d which is similar to \u201corphan drug exclusivity\u201d in the United States. We have been notified by HC that RAVICTI is not eligible for data protection. If we cannot successfully appeal this decision to obtain data protection, we may withdraw our filing for marketing approval in Canada. Even if we do not withdraw our application to market RAVICTI in Canada, we cannot be assured that the EMA or HC will approve our applications to market RAVICTI in Europe and Canada, respectively, nor can we be certain of the timelines for these agencies to make their determinations. If we fail to obtain approval to market RAVICTI from the EMA prior to February 2016 when the RAVICTI composition of matter patent expires in European jurisdictions in which it is validated, we will not be eligible to apply to extend the patent\u2019s term, and we will have to rely on maintaining orphan designation to ensure marketing exclusivity in Europe. If we fail to obtain and maintain required approvals or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of RAVICTI will be harmed. In addition to the regulatory approvals that we must obtain in Europe and Canada in order to market RAVICTI, we must obtain approvals for reimbursement on a country by country basis in Europe and on a province by province basis in Canada. If we cannot obtain adequate reimbursement for RAVICTI in these markets, even if we obtain marketing approvals, it may not be commercially viable for us to expand our sales outside the United States. Moreover, even if we obtain marketing approval in Europe, we cannot be assured that we can maintain orphan designation for RAVICTI in the EU as we must demonstrate that the product provides \u201csignificant benefit\u201d in those UCD subtypes for which AMMONAPS is approved. In Europe, as in Canada, we would likely choose not to sell RAVICTI if we cannot be assured that we can obtain market exclusivity for our product in those jurisdictions.\nIf we are unable to maintain agreements with, and effectively manage, third parties to distribute our UCD products to patients, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to distribute our UCD products to patients. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse our UCD products. For RAVICTI, we contract with two specialty pharmacies and one specialty distributor to sell and distribute to patients and hospitals. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. For BUPHENYL, which we acquired on May 31, 2013, we operate under a contract with a wholesaler which distributes and sells to retail pharmacies, hospitals and other dispensing organizations. We have also contracted with a third-party call center to coordinate prescription intake and distribution, reimbursement adjudication, patient financial support and ongoing compliance support for our UCD products. The distribution network in place requires significant coordination with our commercial operations, sales and marketing and finance organizations. Failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue from sales of our UCD products. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, the sales of our UCD products, as well as any future products we may commercialize, will be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.\nIn addition, since we use specialty pharmacies and heavily rely on our third-party call center to support our UCD products, we are subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations may:\n\u2022\nnot provide us with accurate or timely information regarding inventories, the number of patients who are using our UCD products, or complaints and adverse events regarding those drugs;\n\u2022\nnot effectively sell or support our UCD products; or\n\u2022\nbe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others;\nAny such events may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our results of operations and business.\nIf we are unable to maintain orphan drug exclusivity for RAVICTI for the treatment of UCD in the United States, we may face increased competition.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. A company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years from the date of its approval. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the approval of another drug containing the same active ingredient and used for the same orphan indication except in very limited circumstances, based upon the FDA\u2019s determination that a subsequent drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care, or if the orphan drug manufacturer is unable to assure that a sufficient quantity of the orphan drug is available to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA later determines that the initial request for designation was materially defective. RAVICTI was granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA in May 2013, which we expect will provide the drug with orphan drug marketing exclusivity in the United States until February 2020, seven years from the date of its approval. However, such exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition if the FDA determines that a subsequent drug for the same indication is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care, or if we are unable to assure the FDA that sufficient quantities of RAVICTI are available to meet patient demand. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving competing drugs for the same or similar indication containing a different active ingredient. If a subsequent drug is approved for marketing for the same or a similar indication we may face increased competition, and our revenues from the sale of RAVICTI will be adversely affected. RAVICTI does not have orphan drug exclusivity in the EU or other regions of the world.\nIf we fail to sustain an adequate level of reimbursement for our UCD products by third-party payors, sales would be adversely affected.\nAlthough the price of BUPHENYL per gram is approximately one fifth that of RAVICTI, we expect UCD patients to need treatment throughout their lifetimes and most families of patients are not capable of paying for either of these medications themselves. There would be no commercially viable market for RAVICTI or BUPHENYL without reimbursement from third-party payors. If we cannot sustain the level of reimbursement from third party payors that we have been able to achieve, our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected. In addition, we provide RAVICTI and BUPHENYL at no cost to qualified patients without insurance or without coverage for either product. If the number of patients that qualify for these programs rises, our revenues and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nThird-party payors, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors. A current trend in the United States health care industry is toward cost containment. Large public and private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, are questioning the coverage of, and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved health care products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. If the prices for our products decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement levels, or if we are forced to provide additional discounts or rebates in order to maintain coverage, our revenue and prospects for operating profitability will suffer. Reimbursement systems in international markets, including the EU, vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. The negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12 months.\nWe are required to complete post-marketing studies mandated by the FDA for RAVICTI and such studies may be costly and time consuming. If the results of these studies reveal unacceptable safety risks, we may be required to withdraw RAVICTI from the market.\nThe FDA imposed several post-marketing requirements and a post marketing commitment, which include remaining obligations to conduct:\n\u2022\nstudies in UCD patients during the first two months of life and from 2 months to 2 years of age, including a study of the pharmacokinetics in both age groups; and\n\u2022\na randomized study to determine the safety and efficacy in UCD patients who are treatment na\u00efve to phenylbutyrate treatment.\nIf we are unable to complete these studies or the results of the studies reveal unacceptable safety risks, we may not be able to extend the label to include UCD patients less than two years of age and/or could be required to perform additional studies, which may be costly, and even lose marketing approval for RAVICTI. In addition to these studies, the FDA may also require us to conduct other lengthy post-marketing studies, for which we would have to expend significant additional resources, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and stock price.\nTo obtain regulatory approval to market glycerol phenylbutyrate (\u201cGPB\u201d) in HE, costly and lengthy clinical trials will be required, and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain.\nAs part of the regulatory approval process, we must conduct, at our own expense, clinical trials on humans for each indication that we intend to pursue. We expect the number of nonclinical studies and clinical trials that the regulatory authorities will require will vary depending on the disease or condition the drug is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the particular drug. Generally, the number and size of clinical trials required for approval varies based on the nature of the disease and size of the expected patient population that may be treated with a drug, and we are still in discussions with the FDA as to the design of additional HE clinical trials required for approval. We must demonstrate that our drug products are safe and efficacious for use in the targeted human patients in order to receive regulatory approval for commercial sale, and it is possible future trials of GPB may not result in approval.\nSerious adverse events or other safety risks could require us to abandon development and preclude or limit approval of GPB to treat HE.\nWe may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to study participants or if preliminary data demonstrate that the product is unlikely to receive regulatory approval or unlikely to be successfully commercialized. In addition, regulatory agencies, institutional review boards and data safety monitoring boards may at any time order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of GPB to treat HE, the commercial prospects for GPB will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from GPB may be delayed or eliminated.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize RAVICTI outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf RAVICTI is approved for commercialization outside the United States or Canada, we plan to enter into agreements with third parties to market RAVICTI in those international markets. On May 31, 2013, we acquired worldwide rights to BUPHENYL from Ucyclyd. As part of the acquisition of BUPHENYL, we assumed Ucyclyd\u2019s rights and obligations under its existing agreements for distribution of BUPHENYL outside the United States, including Ucyclyd\u2019s distribution agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB. We have extended this distribution agreement through December 31, 2015. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into or maintaining these international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering United States and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements or changes in the application of regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent reimbursement systems;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by these distributors; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nWe continue to face extensive development and regulatory requirements with respect to our marketed products.\nEven after a drug is FDA-approved, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. Furthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety or other issues could result in delays or increased costs to assure compliance.\nBUPHENYL and RAVICTI are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and with respect to BUPHENYL, requirements of the EU. In addition, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d). As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, when applicable, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. For example, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have FDA approval If a regulatory agency discovers problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility or the manufacturing process at the facility where the product is manufactured, or problems with the quality of product manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing, or labeling of a product, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product use, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products or require a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize and generate additional revenues from RAVICTI and BUPHENYL. We have recently engaged FDA in discussions related to a change we made to an analytical method for RAVICTI without obtaining FDA\u2019s prior approval. If FDA determines that prior approval was required, we could face sanctions. If sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to continue to generate revenues from the sale of RAVICTI and BUPHENYL our potential for maintaining operating profitability will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nIf third-party manufacturers fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nContract manufacturers must obtain and maintain regulatory approval of their manufacturing facilities, processes and quality systems. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, before and after product approval. Due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture pharmaceutical products and product candidates, any potential third-party manufacturer may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal, state or international regulatory inspections in a cost effective manner.\nIf a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract is unable to comply with manufacturing regulations or is unable to consistently produce the product to meet specifications, we may be subject to fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nIf our competitors are able to develop and market products that are preferred over RAVICTI or BUPHENYL, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe face competition from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products to treat UCD or HE. During the lifetime of the United States patents covering RAVICTI, and for any longer period of market exclusivity granted by the FDA for RAVICTI, Ucyclyd and its affiliates are contractually prohibited from developing or commercializing new products, anywhere in the world, for the treatment of UCD or HE that are chemically similar to RAVICTI, except for products delivered parenterally for the treatment of HE. In countries outside the United States, this contractual restriction will continue, on a country-by-basis, for the lifetime of patents covering RAVICTI in each such country and for any longer period of regulatory exclusivity granted for RAVICTI in each such country. Since this restriction only applies to specific indications and products that are chemically similar to RAVICTI, it may not prevent Ucyclyd or its affiliates from developing and commercializing products that compete with RAVICTI. Moreover, products approved for indications other than UCD and HE may compete with RAVICTI if physicians prescribe such products off-label for UCD or HE.\nIn November 2011, Ampolgen Pharmaceuticals, LLC received FDA approval for a generic version of NaPBA tablets, which may compete with RAVICTI and BUPHENYL in treating UCD. In March 2013, SigmaPharm Laboratories, LLC received FDA approval for a generic version of NaPBA powder, which competes with BUPHENYL and may compete with RAVICTI in treating UCD. In July 2013, Lucane received marketing approval from the European Medicines Agency for taste-masked NaPBA and has announced a distribution partnership in Canada. In January 2015, Lucane announced it had received marketing approval for its taste masked NaPBA in Canada. It is our understanding that only the first phenylbutyrate-containing product approved for an indication in Canada is eligible for \u201cdata protection\u201d which is similar to \u201corphan drug exclusivity\u201d in the United States. We have been notified by HC that RAVICTI is not eligible for data protection. If we cannot successfully appeal this decision to obtain data protection, we may withdraw our filing to market RAVICTI in Canada. We believe Lucane is also seeking approval via an abbreviated new drug application (\u201cANDA\u201d) in the United States. If this ANDA is approved, this formulation may compete with RAVICTI and BUPHENYL in treating UCD in the United States. We are also aware that Orphan Europe is conducting a clinical trial of carglumic acid to treat some of the UCD enzyme deficiencies for which RAVICTI was approved. Promethera has successfully completed Phase I/II trials of its cell-based therapy for the treatment of UCD and plans to conduct a Phase IIb/III clinical trial. Aeglea Biotherapeutics has a degrading enzyme treatment in preclinical development for arginase 1 deficiency. Carglumic acid is approved for maintenance therapy for chronic hyperammonemia and to treat HA crises in N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency, a rare UCD subtype, and is sold under the name Carbaglu. If the results of this trial are successful and Orphan Europe is able to complete development and obtain approval of Carbaglu to treat additional UCD enzyme deficiencies, we would face competition from this compound. In addition, if we complete development, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize GPB to treat HE, we will face competition from Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the manufacturer of rifaximin, as well as generic manufacturers of lactulose. In addition to currently marketed treatments for HE, Ocera Therapeutics, Inc. is conducting a Phase II trial of a compound delivered intravenously to patients with cirrhosis in which they are assessing ammonia control versus placebo and has disclosed it is working to develop an oral formulation for chronic use. In addition, researchers are continually learning more about UCD and HE and new discoveries may lead to new therapies. As a result, RAVICTI and BUPHENYL may be rendered less competitive at any time, or even obsolete. Other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nOur commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than RAVICTI and BUPHENYL. We expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully and rapidly complete clinical trials and obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nextend patent protection for RAVICTI or otherwise prevent the introduction of generics of RAVICTI;\n\u2022\nattract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nmaintain an adequate sales and marketing infrastructure;\n\u2022\nidentify patients able and willing to adopt RAVICTI as a replacement for NaPBA or any other UCD treatment options;\n\u2022\nobtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nmaintain positive relationships with the patient community.\nIf GPB is approved and marketed to treat HE in the future, the cost of RAVICTI to treat UCD may decline significantly, which could materially affect our UCD revenues.\nThe same active ingredient underlies RAVICTI to treat UCD and GPB which we have in trials for HE. Given the relative differences in the size of the affected patient populations in UCD and HE, respectively, the number of requests third-party payors receive to reimburse drugs for the treatment of HE is significantly greater than the number of requests for UCD. As a result, and given the common active ingredient we will likely experience greater pricing pressure for RAVICTI if GPB is approved by the FDA to treat HE. We do not currently have a plan to differentiate the formulations for UCD and HE, nor can we guarantee success if we attempt to differentiate the formulation. We expect the required dosing volume for HE to be similar to the average required dosing for UCD. If GPB is approved by the FDA for HE, and we decide to make it commercially available , we may need to significantly decrease the price for RAVICTI from that established with respect to UCD or offer discounts to third party payors for HE prescriptions in order to gain third-party reimbursement for broad use in HE patients. This would result in a significant decrease in revenues generated by the UCD patient population. We believe GPB revenue potential for HE is much larger than RAVICTI is for UCD; however, if the market for GPB in HE is significantly smaller than we anticipate, if the required commercial operations are more expensive than we anticipate, or if we are unsuccessful in any commercial launch of GPB for the treatment of HE, total RAVICTI revenues may decrease significantly and we may be unable to achieve or maintain operating profitability. If the RAVICTI price is decreased with the introduction of the drug for HE, we may need to decrease our UCD specialty pharmacy and patient support service offerings. This may result in lower UCD revenues due to fewer UCD patients electing to begin use of RAVICTI and/or remain compliant.\nBudget constraints may require us to limit our expenditure of resources and bypass opportunities to develop particular product candidates or indications.\nBecause we have limited financial and human resources and drug development is an expensive process, we must regularly assess the most efficient allocation of our resources, focusing on development programs and product candidates for the specific indications that we believe are the most scientifically and commercially promising. Accordingly, we may choose to delay our development efforts for a promising product candidate or we may elect to terminate our programs for and, in certain cases, our licenses to, such product candidates or programs in order to allocate resources to other programs, which could cause us to alter near-term development and/or commercialization objectives. As a result, we may not be able to fully realize the value of some of our product candidates in a timely manner, since those products will be delayed in reaching the market, or may not reach the market at all. If we terminate a clinical program in which we have invested significant resources, we will have expended resources on a program that will not provide a return on our investment.\nFurthermore, our resource allocation decisions, and our decisions about whether and how to develop or commercialize any particular product candidate may be based on evaluations of the scientific and commercial potential or target market for the product candidate that later prove to be inaccurate. If we enter into collaborations, licensing or other royalty arrangements to develop or commercialize a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate in situations where it would have been more advantageous for us to retain rights to development and commercialization. For example, we continue to evaluate the available commercial data on HE as we move forward with our clinical program in GPB for that indication and will be continually assessing all relevant scientific and commercial factors in determining whether to continue our development of GPB as a treatment for HE.\nIf we are unable to maintain an effective sales force or expand it as needed as our operations grow, our business may be harmed.\nWe market RAVICTI and BUPHENYL directly to physicians in the United States through our own sales force and plan to market through our own sales force if we receive marketing approval and data protection for\nRAVICTI and launch in Canada. We will need to continue to incur significant expenses and commit significant management resources to train our sales force to market and sell RAVICTI and BUPHENYL. We may not be able to effectively maintain these capabilities and expand them into Canada, if needed, despite these expenditures. We will also have to compete with other pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. In the event we are unable to successfully maintain and expand our marketing and promotion of RAVICTI and BUPHENYL, our business may be harmed.\nIf we are found to be in violation of federal or state \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, we may be required to pay a penalty and/or be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn the United States, we are subject to various federal and state health care \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other laws intended to reduce fraud and abuse in federal and state health care programs. The federal Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Act (the \u201cAnti-Kickback Statute\u201d), makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Under federal government regulations, some arrangements, known as safe harbors, are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors, including government purchasers, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services that were not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Cases have been brought under false claims laws alleging that off-label promotion and other forms of improper promotion of pharmaceutical products or the provision of kickbacks has resulted in the submission of false claims to governmental health care programs. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, we are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nMany states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental purchasers. In addition, California and a few other states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the May 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. In addition, several states impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties.\nNeither the government nor the courts have provided definitive guidance on the application of fraud and abuse laws to our business. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. While we believe we have structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws, it is possible that the government could allege violations of\nthese laws, engage in burdensome investigations, or convict us of violations. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we could be required to pay a penalty and could be suspended or excluded from participation in federal or state health care programs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and may affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-marketing activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn the United States, the Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price,\u201d (\u201cAMP\u201d), for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also expanded the scope of the Medicaid drug rebate program;-rebates previously had been payable only on fee-for-service utilization, but are now also payable on Medicaid managed care utilization. It also created an alternative rebate formula for certain innovator products that qualify as line extensions of certain existing products, which is likely to increase the rebates due on those drugs. CMS, which administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, has issued proposed regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation but has not yet issued final regulations. CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebates to the utilization that occurs in the territories of the United States, such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing discount program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer\u2019s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, with the exception of children\u2019s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when those products are used for their orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above will cause the required 340B discount to increase.\nFurther the Affordable Care Act imposed a significant annual branded prescription drug fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products and requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices related to interactions with healthcare providers. Also under the Affordable Care Act pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to new federal reporting and disclosure requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain healthcare providers. Reports submitted under these federal requirements are placed in a public database.\nNotably, a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become effective. Although it is too early to determine the full effect of the Affordable Care Act, the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicaid program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee\non Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which started in 2013.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Furthermore, the concerns raised by patients, patient advocacy groups and congressional representatives about the recent pricing of orphan drugs, could result in changes to the Orphan Drug Act or limitations in the approval pathway or pricing and reimbursement of orphan drugs.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe currently have a limited source of revenue and may not sustain operating profitability.\nWe started generating product revenue during 2013. Our ability to generate continued product revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nmaintain an acceptable price for our UCD products;\n\u2022\nmaintain market acceptance for RAVICTI as an alternative to BUPHENYL;\n\u2022\nobtain commercial quantities of our UCD products at acceptable cost levels;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully continue marketing and selling our UCD products in the United States and expand to markets outside the United States;\n\u2022\ndelay the introduction of additional generics and new therapies and the impact of new therapies to treat UCD and HE and generic versions of our UCD products;\n\u2022\nmaintain our licenses or sublicenses to intellectual property rights to RAVICTI; and\n\u2022\nmaintain existing distribution agreements for BUPHENYL outside the United States.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or sustain operating profitability.\nEven as we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not achieve sustainable operating profitability and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we are unable to achieve and sustain operating profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nWe have incurred net operating losses on an annual basis since inception and anticipate that we may continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred losses from operations in each year since our inception on November 1, 2006. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $128.6 million. We have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our nonclinical development activities and clinical trials. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt. Although RAVICTI is now providing us with sustained revenues in the U.S., it will require significant ongoing marketing efforts and substantial investment before it can provide us with revenues outside the U.S. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to be significant in connection with our ongoing and planned clinical trials for RAVICTI in UCD and GPB in HE and any other clinical trials or nonclinical testing that we may initiate. In addition, we expect to incur increased sales and marketing expenses. Further, we will continue to incur significant legal expenses related to the Par litigation until the case has settled or been fully adjudicated. In addition, we may continue to incur DiaPep277-related expenses. As a result, we may continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. These losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to have sufficient resources to fund current or future programs. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully maintain sales of RAVICTI and BUPHENYL for the treatment of UCD including selling prices for those products and the maintenance of adequate third party reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;;\n\u2022\nthe costs of litigation relating to Par, Andromeda or other disputes that we may become a party to;\n\u2022\nthe costs of integrating acquired businesses or technologies; the amount of sales or other revenues from product candidates, including GPB for the treatment of HE, that we may develop or acquire, including the selling prices for such products and the availability of adequate third-party reimbursement;\n\u2022\nselling and marketing costs associated with our UCD products, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe progress, timing, scope and costs of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll patients in our planned and potential future clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post-marketing studies that may be required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe costs of obtaining clinical and commercial supplies of RAVICTI and BUPHENYL;\n\u2022\npayments of milestones and royalties to third parties, including Ucyclyd;\n\u2022\ncash requirements of any future acquisitions of products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nchanges to the design of our clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nAny new collaborative, licensing, acquisition and other commercial relationships that we may establish.\nIf we need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations, we expect to finance such future cash needs through public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Our inability to obtain additional funding when we need it could seriously harm our business.\nWe may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business.\nIn order to raise additional funds to support our operations, we may sell additional equity or debt securities, including convertible debt, which would result in dilution to all of our stockholders or impose restrictive covenants that adversely impact our business. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in more restrictive covenants than those contained in our loan with Silicon Valley Bank, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe have no manufacturing capacity and anticipate continued reliance on third-party manufacturers for the development and commercialization of our products.\nWe do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of RAVICTI or BUPHENYL. We lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture RAVICTI or BUPHENYL in our own facilities on a clinical or commercial scale. We do not intend to develop facilities for the manufacture of products for clinical trials or commercial purposes in the foreseeable future. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk drug substance and finished drug products required for our clinical trials and commercial sale. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers to manufacture clinical and commercial quantities of RAVICTI and BUPHENYL and the related bulk drug substances. We have bulk drug substance for the production of clinical and commercial supplies of RAVICTI manufactured for us by Helsinn Advanced Synthesis SA (Switzerland) and DPx Fine Chemicals Austria GmbH on a purchase order basis. We have bulk drug substance for the production of clinical and commercial supplies of BUPHENYL manufactured for us by CU Chemie Uetikon GmbH (Germany). We have clinical and commercial supplies of BUPHENYL finished product manufactured for us by Pharmaceutics International, Inc. on a purchase order basis. We have clinical and commercial supplies of RAVICTI finished drug product manufactured by Lyne Laboratories, Inc. under a commercial supply agreement and have an agreement in place at Halo Pharmaceutical, Inc., with Halo to serve as a secondary finished drug product supplier for RAVICTI. If we need to identify an additional fill/finish manufacturer, we would not be able to do so without significant delay and likely significant additional cost.\nOur contract manufacturers\u2019 failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, product shortages, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified\npersonnel. Our existing manufacturers and any future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business. In the event of a natural disaster, business failure, strike or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace a third-party manufacturer in a timely manner and the production of our UCD products would be interrupted, resulting in delays, additional costs and lost revenues which could be material.\nIn addition, because our contract manufacturers of the RAVICTI and BUPHENYL bulk drug substance are located outside of the United States, we may face difficulties in importing bulk product into the United States as a result of, among other things, FDA import inspections or bans, incomplete or inaccurate import documentation, product loss or diversion, or defective packaging.\nSome of the intellectual property necessary for the commercialization of our UCD products is or will be licensed from third parties, which will require us to pay milestones and royalties.\nUcyclyd has granted us a license to use some of the technology developed by Ucyclyd in connection with the manufacturing of RAVICTI. The purchase agreement under which we purchased the worldwide rights to RAVICTI further obligates us to pay Ucyclyd regulatory and sales milestone payments relating to RAVICTI, as well as royalties on the net sales of RAVICTI. On May 31, 2013, when we acquired BUPHENYL, under the restated collaboration agreement with Ucyclyd, we received a license to use some of the manufacturing technology developed by Ucyclyd in connection with the manufacturing of BUPHENYL. The restated collaboration agreement further obligates us to pay Ucyclyd regulatory and sales milestone payments, as well as royalties on net sales of BUPHENYL.\nWe may become obligated to make a milestone or royalty payments when we do not have the cash on hand to make these payments, or have budgeted cash for our development efforts. This could cause us to delay our development efforts, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts or seek additional capital to meet these obligations, which could be on terms unfavorable to us. Additionally, if we fail to make a required payment to Ucyclyd and do not cure the failure with the required time period, Ucyclyd may be able to terminate our license to use its manufacturing technology for our UCD products.\nWe also license intellectual property necessary for commercialization of RAVICTI from Brusilow Enterprises, LLC (\u201cBrusilow\u201d). Brusilow may be entitled to terminate our license if we breach that agreement or do not meet specified diligence obligations in our development and commercialization of RAVICTI and do not cure the failure within the required time period. If our license from Brusilow is terminated, it may be difficult or impossible for us to continue to commercialize RAVICTI.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our current and potential future product candidates.\nWe may seek collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of our current and potential future product candidates. We may enter into these arrangements on a selective basis depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for each product candidate, both in the United States and internationally. We will face, to the extent that we decide to enter into collaboration agreements, significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we so chose to enter into such arrangements. The terms of any collaboration or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nAny future collaboration that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.\nDisagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters, can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision making authority.\nCollaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination or expiration would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation.\nWe currently depend on third parties to conduct some of the operations of our clinical trials.\nWe rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct and/or oversee many of the operations of our clinical trials and to perform data collection and analysis. As a result, we may face additional delays outside of our control if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely fashion or in accordance with regulatory requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations and meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons, our financial results and the commercial prospects for RAVICTI in UCD or GPB in HE or our potential future product candidates could be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales could be delayed\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nWe may experience diversion of management attention in the implementation of our agreement with CBI to complete the DiaPep277 clinical trial under the oversight of a Steering Committee\nOn February 16, 2015 we entered into a Completion of Phase III Clinical Trial, Option and Mutual Release Agreement ( the \u201cRelease Agreement\u201d) with CBI and Yeda Research and Development Company Ltd (\u201cYeda\u201d) to resolve our disputes with those parties after we determined certain employees at Andromeda had engaged in serious misconduct, including collusion with a third party biostatistics firm to improperly receive un-blinded trial data from DiaPep277\u2019s initial Phase 3 trial and to use the data to manipulate the analyses to obtain a favorable result. Hyperion further determined that the involved employees and the biostatistics firm continued the improper practice of sharing un-blinded data from DiaPep\u2019s second Phase III trial, the (\u201c1001 trial\u201d). Under the terms of the Release Agreement, we will complete the ongoing 1001 clinical trial, as previously announced, and CBI will have an option to repurchase all of the outstanding stock of Andromeda exercisable through September 30, 2015. If CBI does not exercise its option, DiaPep277 and all related intellectual property will revert to Yeda under Yeda\u2019s license agreement with Andromeda. Prior to the exercise or termination of CBI\u2019s purchase option, oversight of the 1001 trial\u2019s completion will be handled by a Steering Committee comprised of one member from each of CBI, Yeda and us. Although we will not have a vote on the Steering Committee, as the 1001 trial sponsor we will be responsible for all operational aspects of completing the trial. Our obligations include complying with clinical and regulatory obligations, such as preparation and filing of the final Clinical Study Report related to the 1001 trial. As a result, our clinical and regulatory personnel may have their time diverted from our UCD and HE programs to attend to the completion of the DiaPep277 program, and our appointee to the Steering Committee may also be diverted from his or her primary responsibilities in order to manage decisions and processes related to the completion of the 1001 trial and the orderly transition of the DiaPep 277 program to CBI should CBI exercise its option or to Yeda should the technology revert to Yeda.\nWe retained certain liabilities under the Release Agreement with Yeda and CBI and cannot be certain that new disputes will not arise among the parties to the Release Agreement\nAlthough the Release Agreement resolves the disputes among the parties relating to DiaPep277, we cannot be certain that additional legal disputes will not arise among the parties during the term of CBI\u2019s option or after. Further, under the terms of the Release Agreement, the Company agreed to retain certain liabilities relating to its ownership of Andromeda, including any liability related to or based on the misconduct of certain former Andromeda employees that led to its decision to terminate further development of DiaPep277. For example, in February 2015, one of the former employees of Andromeda sued us in Israeli labor court for wrongful dismissal and related employment causes of action. In addition to these potential liabilities, we may incur currently unknown liabilities related to our acquisition of Andromeda. Any such potential legal dispute could lead to costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention from our core business and harm our business.\nWe depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. In particular, the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. We do not currently carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on the lives of members of senior management. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\nForecasting sales of our products is difficult and revenue recognition may be deferred. If our revenue projections are inaccurate or revenue is deferred and our business forecasting and planning decisions are not reflected in our actual results, our business may be harmed and our future prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur management must make forecasting decisions regarding future revenue in the course of business planning despite uncertainty, and actual results of operations may deviate materially from projected results. For example, payor mix estimates are made for RAVICTI and BUPHENYL patients and are difficult to forecast. Further, because RAVICTI is an oral liquid distributed in 25 mL bottles and because dosing is individualized, patients may receive more medication than they are prescribed each month and may not refill in a subsequent month. Finally, we switched our method of revenue recognition for RAVICTI from the \u201csell through\u201d method in which revenue is booked when product is shipped to the patient to the \u201csell in\u201d method in which revenue is recognized when product is shipped to the distributor, only in the second quarter of 2014. Accordingly, we may not be able to accurately predict demand for our products by our customers. A shortfall in our revenue would have a direct impact on our cash flow and on our business in general. In addition, fluctuations in our quarterly revenue results can adversely and significantly affect the market price of our common stock. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements, and any changes in those estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe consolidated financial statements that we file with the SEC are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP involves making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. A summary of our significant accounting practices is included in Note 2-\u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We periodically evaluate estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for reasonableness, including estimates provided by third parties. Appropriate adjustments to the estimates will be made prospectively, as necessary, based on such periodic evaluations. We base our estimates on, among other things, currently available information, market conditions, historical experience and various assumptions, which together form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, estimates would differ if different assumptions were utilized and these estimates may prove in the future to have been inaccurate.\nOur financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results. The preparation of our financial statements require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Significant estimates made by us include assumptions used in the determination of revenue recognition and the calculation of reserves, the fair value of marketable securities and notes payable, fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets, stock-based compensation and the provision for income taxes. Although we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, our interpretation of existing accounting literature and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, if our interpretation or application of existing accounting literature is deemed to be materially incorrect, actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nA failure to maintain optimal inventory levels to meet commercial demand for our products could harm our reputation and subject us to financial losses.\nBecause accurate product planning is necessary to ensure that we maintain optimal inventory levels, significant differences between our current estimates and judgments and future estimated demand for our products and the useful life of inventory may result in significant charges for excess inventory or purchase commitments in the future. If we are required to recognize charges for excess inventories, such charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to maintain optimal inventory levels also depends on the performance of third-party contract manufacturers. If our manufacturers are unsuccessful in either obtaining raw materials or manufacture, if we are unable to release inventory on a timely and consistent basis, if we fail to maintain an adequate level of product inventory, if inventory is destroyed or damaged, or if our inventory reaches its expiration date, patients might not have access\nto our products, our reputation and brands could be harmed, and physicians may be less likely to prescribe our products in the future, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe are a small company with 80 full-time employees as of December 31, 2014. In order to commercialize our products and continue planned clinical development, we need to maintain our employee base of managerial, operational and financial personnel. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u2022\nmanage our clinical trials and the regulatory process effectively;\n\u2022\nmanage the manufacturing and distribution of products for commercial and clinical use;\n\u2022\nintegrate current and additional management, administrative, financial and sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nhire new personnel necessary to effectively commercialize product and/or product candidates we in-license or acquire;\n\u2022\ndevelop our administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u2022\nhire and train additional qualified personnel.\nProduct candidates that we may acquire in the future may be intended for patient populations that are significantly larger than those for UCD and HE. In order to continue development and marketing of these products, if approved, we would need to significantly expand our operations. Our staff, financial resources, systems, procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to manage successfully future market opportunities or our relationships with customers and other third parties.\nIf we engage in acquisitions or acquire additional products or technologies, we will incur a variety of costs, may have integration difficulties and may experience numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business.\nWe may decide to acquire businesses, additional products or technologies that we believe will maximize shareholder value. Although we acquired BUPHENYL in May 2013, we have limited experience in successfully acquiring and integrating products into our current infrastructure. We may not be able to successfully integrate technologies or products without a significant expenditure of operating, financial and management resources. In addition, other acquisitions of products or technologies could require significant capital infusions and could involve many risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nacquisitions may negatively impact our results of operations because they may require us to: incur large one-time charges to earnings, amortize or write down amounts related to goodwill and other intangible assets, as occurred in our acquisition of Andromeda, incur or assume substantial debt or liabilities, or may cause adverse tax consequences or substantial depreciation;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the business, technologies or products that we acquire;\n\u2022\nacquisitions may require significant expected and unanticipated capital infusions, and the acquired products or technologies may not generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs;\n\u2022\nacquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management; and\n\u2022\nacquisitions may involve the entry into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience.\nAny of the foregoing risks could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to adequately address the financial, operational or legal risks of any acquisitions could harm our business. In addition to the financial and operational risks associated with acquisitions enumerated above that could adversely affect our business, the legal risks associated with business acquisitions include the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of the acquired company, including potential intellectual property claims, contract, tort and employment claims. For example, in connection with the misconduct we discovered in the DiaPep277 clinical program, we face a variety of potential liabilities, including in connection with the termination of Andromeda employees engaged in the misconduct. For example, in February 2015, one of the former employees of Andromeda sued us in Israeli labor court for wrongful dismissal and related employment causes of action.\nOur business is affected by macroeconomic conditions.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as well as overall economic conditions and uncertainties resulting from current and future conditions in the global financial markets. For instance, if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, it may not be feasible to pass through price increases to patients. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in order to fund our operations.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of patients and distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute our products. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers, sole-source or single-source suppliers to remain in business or otherwise manufacture or supply product. Failure by any of them to remain a going concern could affect our ability to manufacture and/or supply products.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we will incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit the commercialization of RAVICTI, BUPHENYL or other products.\nWe face potential product liability exposure related to marketing and distributing our products commercially as well as testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials. An individual may bring a liability claim against us alleging that one of our products or product candidates caused an injury. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients and others;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our products.\nIn addition, while we continue to take what we believe are appropriate precautions, we may be unable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us our insurance may be inadequate.\nWe are exposed to the potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. We maintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for commercial sale of RAVICTI and BUPHENYL. We currently maintain insurance for the clinical trials and commercial sale of RAVICTI and BUPHENYL. Biopharmaceutical companies must balance the cost of insurance with the level of coverage based on estimates of potential liability. Historically, the potential liability associated with product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable. Although we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our potential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance, we may be subject to claims for which our insurance coverage may not be adequate. If we are the subject of a successful product liability claim that exceeds the limits of any insurance coverage we obtain, we may incur substantial charges that would adversely affect our earnings and require the commitment of capital resources that might otherwise be available for the development and commercial launch of our product programs.\nBusiness interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our products and could disrupt our sales.\nOur headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to other types of natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations. We do not carry insurance for earthquakes or other natural disasters and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Since our initial public offering, our closing stock price as reported on the NASDAQ Global Stock Market has ranged from $10.04 to $31.87 as of February 25, 2015. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nannouncements of therapeutic innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements with respect to CBI\u2019s decision to exercise or not exercise its option to acquire Andromeda;\n\u2022\nadverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nchanges or developments in laws or regulations applicable to RAVICTI and BUPHENYL;\n\u2022\nany adverse changes to our relationship with Ucyclyd or other licensors, manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe success of our testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe success of our efforts to acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nany action in the Par litigation or any other intellectual property actions in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical industry in general;\n\u2022\nachievement of expected product sales and profitability;\n\u2022\nmanufacture, supply or distribution shortages;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ngeneral global economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the United States equity markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Stock Market in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Further, the decline in the financial markets and related factors beyond our control, including the credit and mortgage crisis in the United States and worldwide, may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could seriously hurt our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur principal stockholders, executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and will be able to exert a significant control over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOur officers and directors, and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, own approximately 60% of our common stock. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in\ncompanies with controlling stockholders. As a result, these stockholders, if they acted together, could significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nSome of the holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to investors.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had net operating losses of approximately $36.4 million and $107.8 million for both U.S. federal and California income tax purposes, respectively, for which carryforwards begin to expire in 2031 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and 2028 for California income tax purposes. If we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), we may be subject to annual limits on our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards. An ownership change is, as a general matter, triggered by sales or acquisitions of our stock in excess of 50% on a cumulative basis during a three-year period by persons owning 5% or more of our total equity value. We underwent a change in control during the year ended December 31, 2014, and as a result our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $50.0 million.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with some of the laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the SEC, which could undermine investor confidence in our company and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including:\n\u2022\nthe provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nthe \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Act and some of the disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of its chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nthe requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act, and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nany rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements.\nWe may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of: (i) the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nWe currently take advantage of some, but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d For example, we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 13533, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HPTX"}
