RISK FACTORS.\nThere are numerous and varied risks that may prevent us from achieving our goals, including those described below. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information included in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks. If any of the events or circumstances described below were to occur, our business, the financial condition and the results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors could lose part or all of their investment. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisk Factor Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and may continue to adversely affect our business;\n\u25cf We have incurred significant losses since our inception and may continue to incur losses and thus may never achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u25cf Our debt level could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects;\n\u25cf Our debt instruments contain covenants that could limit our financing options and liquidity position, which would limit our ability to grow our business;\n\u25cf The 2020 Jackson Note is secured by substantially all of our assets that are not secured by our revolving loan facility with Midcap, and the terms of the 2020 Jackson Note may restrict our current and future operations. Additionally, Jackson may be able to exert significant influence over us as our senior secured lender;\n\u25cf We will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, which is likely to be challenging, could be highly dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline;\n\u25cf We have significant working capital needs and if we are unable to satisfy those needs from cash generated from our operations or borrowings under our debt instruments, we may not be able to continue our operations;\n\u25cf The continuing uncertainty surrounding the implementation of Brexit and future arrangements between the U.K and the European Union may impact our U.K. operations;\n\u25cf Our revenue may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf Our revenue can vary because our customers can terminate their relationship with us at any time with limited or no penalty;\n\u25cf We operate in an intensely competitive and rapidly changing business environment, and there is a substantial risk that our services could become obsolete or uncompetitive;\n\u25cf We have been and may be exposed to employment-related claims and losses, including class action lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business;\n\u25cf We may not meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, which could result in a delisting of our common stock;\n\u25cf A more active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly;\n\u25cf Our strategy of growing through acquisitions may impact our business in unexpected ways;\n\u25cf We depend on attracting, integrating, managing, and retaining qualified personnel;\n\u25cf If we are unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers, our business and results of operations could suffer;\n\u25cf We are dependent upon technology services, and if we experience damage, service interruptions or failures in our computer and telecommunications systems, our customer relationships and our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected; and\n\u25cf Our management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the lack of a sufficient complement of competent finance personnel to appropriately account for, review and disclose the completeness and accuracy of transactions entered into by the Company. This material weakness, if not remediated, could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\n\u25cf Our management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over our goodwill assessment relating to the lack of a sufficient process for determining the valuation of goodwill assets. This material weakness, if not remediated, could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and may continue to adversely affect our business.\nIn December 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, and spread globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has, from time to time, led to government-imposed quarantines, limitations on business activity and shelter-in-place mandates to mitigate or contain the virus, and has contributed to financial market volatility and uncertainty, significant disruptions in general commercial activity and the global economy, including in the United States and the United Kingdom where our operations are based. Much of the independent contractor work we provide to our clients is performed at the site of our clients. As a result, we are subject to the plans and approaches of our clients have made to address the COVID-19 pandemic, such as whether they support remote working or if they have simply closed their facilities and furloughed employees. To the extent that our clients were to decide or are required to close their facilities, or not permit remote work when they close facilities, we would no longer generate revenue and profit from that client. In addition, in the event that our clients\u2019 businesses suffer or close as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience decline in our revenue or write-off of receivables from such clients. Developments such as social distancing and shelter-in-place directives have impacted our ability to deploy our staffing workforce effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby impacting contracts with customers in our commercial staffing and professional staffing business streams, and may continue to impact our business and results of operations should such measures be implemented again. While some government-imposed precautionary measures have been relaxed in certain countries or states, more strict measures may be put in place again due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases or emergence of new variants of the virus.\nOur business was impacted in Fiscal 2021 by numerous government-mandated lockdown periods in the United States and United Kingdom. This had a large impact on the financial results of our numerous business streams, which differed in their financial recoveries primarily due to the geographies and industries in which they operate.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be highly uncertain and subject to future developments. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital and on the market price of our common stock, and affect our ability to successfully raise needed capital. If we are unsuccessful in raising capital in the future, we may need to reduce activities, curtail or cease operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt the marketplaces in which we operate, which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and overall liquidity, as it has previously.\nRisks Relating to Our Organization\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and may continue to incur losses and thus may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred substantial losses since our inception, anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may not achieve or sustain profitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the staffing industry, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. Expected future operating losses will have an adverse effect on our cash resources, stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. The Company\u2019s negative working capital and liquidity position combined with the uncertainty generated by the economic reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur failure to become and remain profitable could depress the value of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, diversify our portfolio of staffing companies, or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our common stock could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment. For more detailed discussion of the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, please see \u201cThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and may continue to adversely affect our business until the pandemic is resolved\u201d above.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report as of and for the year ended January 1, 2022 expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern based on our negative working capital and liquidity position combined with the uncertainty generated by the economic reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty and have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets which would have an adverse impact on our business and developmental activities. In such a scenario, the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. The reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our independent registered public accounting firm and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into strategic alliances.\nOur debt level could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nAs of January 1, 2022, our total gross debt was approximately $9,758. Our level of debt could have significant consequences to our stockholders, including the following:\n\u25cf requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to make payments on debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u25cf requiring a substantial portion of our corporate cash reserves to be held as a reserve for debt service, limiting our ability to invest in new growth opportunities;\n\u25cf limiting the ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;\n\u25cf limiting the flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions including the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf putting us at a competitive disadvantage versus less leveraged competitors; and\n\u25cf increasing vulnerability to changes in the prevailing interest rates.\nOur ability to make payments of principal and interest, or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors. We had positive cash flows from operations for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022, and we may not generate cash flow in the future sufficient to service our debt because of factors beyond our control, including but not limited to our ability to expand our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. A default on our debt obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nFurther, the outstanding Second Amended and Restated 12% Senior Secured Note due September 30, 2022 (the \u201c2020 Jackson Note\u201d) contains certain customary financial covenants, and we have had instances of non-compliance. Management has historically been able to obtain from the Jackson Investment Group LLC (\u201cJackson\u201d), waivers of any non-compliance and management expects to continue to be able to obtain necessary waivers in the event of future non-compliance; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such waivers, and should Jackson refuse to provide a waiver in the future, the outstanding debt under the agreement could become due immediately. Our financing with MidCap Funding X Trust (\u201cMidCap\u201d) includes customary financial covenants and we have had instances of non-compliance. We have been able to obtain forbearance of any non-compliance from MidCap, and management expects to continue to be able to obtain necessary forbearance in the event of future non-compliance; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such forbearance, and should MidCap refuse to provide a forbearance in the future, the outstanding debt under the agreement could become due immediately, which exceeds our current cash balance.\nOur debt instruments contain covenants that could limit our financing options and liquidity position, which would limit our ability to grow our business.\nCovenants in our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions prohibit or limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf pay cash dividends to our stockholders, subject to certain limited exceptions;\n\u25cf redeem or repurchase our common stock or other equity;\n\u25cf incur additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf permit liens on assets;\n\u25cf make certain investments (including through the acquisition of stock, shares, partnership or limited liability company interests, any loan, advance or capital contribution);\n\u25cf sell, lease, license, lend or otherwise convey an interest in a material portion of our assets;\n\u25cf cease making public filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d); and\n\u25cf sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock or other capital stock subject to certain limited exceptions.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictions in our debt instruments could result in events of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. The holders of our debt may require fees and expenses to be paid or other changes to terms in connection with waivers or amendments. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates. In addition, these restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, withstand downturns in our business or take advantage of business opportunities.\nThe 2020 Jackson Note is secured by substantially all of our assets that are not secured by our revolving loan facility with Midcap, and the terms of the 2020 Jackson Note may restrict our current and future operations. Additionally, Jackson may be able to exert significant influence over us as our senior secured lender.\nThe 2020 Jackson Note contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our long-term best interests. The 2020 Jackson Note includes covenants limiting or restricting, among other things, our ability to:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase shares of our capital stock or redeem or repurchase any of our subordinated debt;\n\u25cf make certain investments;\n\u25cf sell assets;\n\u25cf enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u25cf incur or allow the existence of liens;\n\u25cf consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, the 2020 Jackson Note contains financial covenants including, among other things, a fixed charge coverage ratio, minimum liquidity requirements and total leverage ratio. A breach of any of these financial covenants could result in a default under the 2020 Jackson Note. If any such default occurs, Jackson may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, following an event of default under the 2020 Jackson Note, Jackson will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure the debt, which includes our available cash. If the debt under the 2020 Jackson Note was to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, which is likely to be challenging, could be highly dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $18,469, an accumulated deficit of $84,021 and a net income of $8,158 in Fiscal 2021. We will need to raise additional capital to pursue growth opportunities, improve our infrastructure, finance our operations and otherwise make investments in assets and personnel that will allow us to remain competitive. Additional capital would be used to accomplish the following:\n\u25cf financing our current operating expenses;\n\u25cf pursuing growth opportunities;\n\u25cf making capital improvements to improve our infrastructure;\n\u25cf hiring and retaining qualified management and key employees;\n\u25cf responding to competitive pressures;\n\u25cf complying with regulatory requirements; and\n\u25cf maintaining compliance with applicable laws.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of those securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then-outstanding. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining personnel, option or warrant exercises, future acquisitions or future placements of our securities for capital-raising or other business purposes. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline further and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nFurthermore, any additional debt or equity financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to curtail our development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate, in which event it is unlikely that stockholders would receive any distribution on their shares. Further, we may not be able to continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations needed to stay in business.\nWe have significant working capital needs and if we are unable to satisfy those needs from cash generated from our operations or borrowings under our debt instruments, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nWe require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business. We often have high receivables from our customers, and as a staffing company, we are prone to cash flow imbalances because we have to fund payroll payments to temporary workers before receiving payments from clients for our services. Cash flow imbalances also occur because we must pay temporary workers even when we have not been paid by our customers. If we experience a significant and sustained drop in operating profits, or if there are unanticipated reductions in cash inflows or increases in cash outlays, we may be subject to cash shortfalls. If such a shortfall were to occur for even a brief period of time, it may have a significant adverse effect on our business. In particular, we use working capital to pay expenses relating to our temporary workers and to satisfy our workers\u2019 compensation liabilities. As a result, we must maintain sufficient cash availability to pay temporary workers and fund related tax liabilities prior to receiving payment from customers.\nIn addition, our operating results tend to be unpredictable from quarter to quarter. Demand for our services is typically lower during traditional national vacation periods in the United States and United Kingdom when customers and candidates are on vacation. No single quarter is predictive of results of future periods. Any extended period of time with low operating results or cash flow imbalances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive working capital for our operations through cash generated by our operating activities, equity raises, and borrowings under our debt instruments. If our working capital needs increase in the future, we may be forced to seek additional sources of capital, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The amount we are entitled to borrow under our debt instruments is calculated monthly based on the aggregate value of certain eligible trade accounts receivable generated from our operations, which are affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows. The aggregate value of our eligible accounts receivable may not be adequate to allow for borrowings for other corporate purposes, such as capital expenditures or growth opportunities, which could reduce our ability to react to changes in the market or industry conditions.\nWe face risks associated with litigation and claims.\nWe are a party to certain legal proceedings as further described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Legal Proceedings.\u201d In addition, from time to time, we may become involved in various claims, disputes and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and relate to contractual and other obligations. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on any claims made against us in any such lawsuit. Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nThe continuing uncertainty surrounding the implementation of Brexit and future arrangements between the U.K and the European Union may impact our U.K. operations.\nPursuant to a June 2016 referendum, the U.K. left the European Union on January 31, 2020. Following a transition period, the U.K. and the European Union signed a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which came into full force on May 1, 2021 and set out the foundation of the economic and legal framework for trade between the U.K. and the European Union. While the company has yet to experience any negative impacts, there may continue to be economic uncertainty surrounding the consequences of Brexit and the U.K.\u2019s future arrangements with the European Union that could adversely impact customer confidence, resulting in customers reducing their spending budgets on our services. There has been volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, which could continue, as well as market volatility, which contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, political institutions, and regulatory agencies as negotiations of trade deals between the U.K. and the European Union, and also between the U.K. and other countries. These and other adverse consequences such as reduced consumer spending, deterioration in economic conditions, loss of key international employees, volatility in exchange rates, and prohibitive laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur revenue may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA significant portion of our expenditures are expected to be derived or spent in British pounds. However, we report our financial condition and results of operations in U.S. dollars. As a result, fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the British pound will impact the amount of our revenues and net income. For example, if the British pound appreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, the fluctuation will result in a positive impact on the revenues that we report. However, if the British pound depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, which was the case during 2016 and in 2020, there will be a negative impact on the revenues we report due to such fluctuation. It is possible that the impact of currency fluctuations will result in a decrease in reported consolidated sales even though we may have experienced an increase in sales transacted in the British pound. Conversely, the impact of currency fluctuations may result in an increase in reported consolidated sales despite declining sales transacted in the British pound. The exchange rate from the U.S. dollar to the British pound has fluctuated substantially in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Though we may choose to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes in the future, there is no guarantee such hedging, if undertaken, will be successful.\nOur revenue can vary because our customers can terminate their relationship with us at any time with limited or no penalty.\nWe focus on providing mid-level professional and light industrial personnel on a temporary assignment-by-assignment basis, which customers can generally terminate at any time or reduce their level of use when compared with prior periods. To avoid large placement agency fees, large companies may use in-house personnel staff, current employee referrals, or human resources consulting companies to find and hire new personnel. Because placement agencies typically charge a fee based on a percentage of the first year\u2019s salary of a new worker, companies with many jobs to fill have a large financial incentive to avoid agencies.\nOur business is also significantly affected by our customers\u2019 hiring needs and their views of their future prospects. Our customers may, on very short notice, terminate, reduce or postpone their recruiting assignments with us and, therefore, affect demand for our services. As a result, a significant number of our customers can terminate their agreements with us at any time, making us particularly vulnerable to a significant decrease in revenue within a short period of time that could be difficult to quickly replace. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our contracts do not obligate our customers to utilize a significant amount of our staffing services and may be cancelled on limited notice, so our revenue is not guaranteed.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from multi-year contracts that are terminable for convenience. Under our multi-year agreements, we contract to provide customers with staffing services through work or service orders at the customers\u2019 request. Under these agreements, our customers often have little or no obligation to request our staffing services. In addition, most of our contracts are cancellable on limited notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. We may hire employees permanently to meet anticipated demand for services under these agreements that may ultimately be delayed or cancelled. We could face a significant decline in revenues and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if:\n\u25cf we see a significant decline in the staffing services requested from us under our service agreements; or\n\u25cf our customers cancel or defer a significant number of staffing requests; or our existing customer agreements expire or lapse and we cannot replace them with similar agreements\nWe operate in an intensely competitive and rapidly changing business environment, and there is a substantial risk that our services could become obsolete or uncompetitive.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive. Our markets are characterized by pressures to provide high levels of service, incorporate new capabilities and technologies, accelerate job completion schedules and reduce prices. Furthermore, we face competition from a number of sources, including other executive search firms and professional search, staffing and consulting firms. Several of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. New and existing competitors are aided by technology, and the market has low barriers to entry. Furthermore, Internet employment sites expand a company\u2019s ability to find workers without the help of traditional agencies. Personnel agencies often work as intermediaries, helping employers accurately describe job openings and screen candidates. Increasing the use of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of staffing companies obsolete. Specifically, the increased use of the internet may attract technology-oriented companies to the professional staffing industry. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing company.\nOur future success will depend largely upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with those developments and advances. Current or future competitors could develop alternative capabilities and technologies that are more effective, easier to use or more economical than our services. In addition, we believe that, with continuing development and increased availability of information technology, the industries in which we compete may attract new competitors. If our capabilities and technologies become obsolete or uncompetitive, our related sales and revenue would decrease. Due to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our services, loss of market share, and loss of customers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by risks associated with acquisitions and joint ventures.\nWe are engaged in the acquisition of U.S. and U.K. based staffing companies, and our typical acquisition model is based on paying consideration in the form of cash, stock, earn-outs and/or promissory notes. To date, we have completed ten acquisitions. We intend to expand our business through acquisitions of complementary businesses, services or products, subject to our business plans and management\u2019s ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable investments or acquisition targets in both new and existing service categories. In certain circumstances, acceptable investments or acquisition targets might not be available. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulty in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure;\n\u25cf potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day-to-day operations;\n\u25cf difficulty entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position;\n\u25cf difficulty maintaining the quality of services that such acquired companies have historically provided; potential legal and financial responsibility for liabilities of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf overpayment for the acquired company or assets or failure to achieve anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\n\u25cf increased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets;\n\u25cf challenges in implementing uniform standards, accounting policies, customs, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business;\n\u25cf failure to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; and\n\u25cf loss of customers and a failure to integrate customer bases.\nOur business plan for continued growth through acquisitions is subject to certain inherent risks, including accessing capital resources, potential cost overruns and possible rejection of our business model and/or sales methods. Therefore, we provide no assurance that we will be successful in carrying out our business plan. We continue to pursue additional debt and equity financing to fund our business plan. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn addition, if we incur indebtedness to finance an acquisition, it may reduce our capacity to borrow additional amounts and require us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the cash resources available to us to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and meet general corporate and working capital needs. This increased indebtedness may also limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry. The use of our common stock or other securities (including those convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock) to finance any such acquisition may also result in dilution of our existing shareholders.\nThe potential risks associated with future acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, result in the loss of key customers or personnel, increase expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be harmed by improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, associate or customer data, including personal data.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment information, about our employees, customers, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally sensitive. In doing so, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third-party vendors we use for a variety of processes. We and our third-party vendors have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. Unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs.\nSuch disclosure, loss or breach could harm our reputation and subject us to government sanctions and liability under our contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. It is possible that security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third-party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such information. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions in which we provide services. Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe have been and may be exposed to employment-related claims and losses, including class action lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to customer information systems and confidential information. The risks of these activities include possible claims relating to:\n\u25cf discrimination and harassment;\n\u25cf wrongful termination or denial of employment;\n\u25cf violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;\n\u25cf classification of temporary workers;\n\u25cf assignment of illegal aliens;\n\u25cf violations of wage and hour requirements;\n\u25cf retroactive entitlement to temporary worker benefits;\n\u25cf errors and omissions by our temporary workers;\n\u25cf misuse of customer proprietary information;\n\u25cf misappropriation of funds;\n\u25cf damage to customer facilities due to negligence of temporary workers; and\n\u25cf criminal activity.\nWe may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems. In addition, these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. New employment and labor laws and regulations may be proposed or adopted that may increase the potential exposure of employers to employment-related claims and litigation. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks. There can also be no assurance that the insurance policies we have purchased to insure against certain risks will be adequate or that insurance coverage will remain available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount or scope of coverage.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and our amended and restated bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). Because our Board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include that:\n\u25cf our Board has the exclusive right to expand the size of our Board and to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u25cf a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority of the Board, the executive chairman or the president, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u25cf our stockholders do not have the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf our Board may alter our Bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u25cf stockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures in order to nominate individuals for election to the Board or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and\n\u25cf our Board is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror.\nIn addition, the terms of the 2020 Jackson Note limit our ability to consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or to effect a change in control of ownership of our company. A breach of such restrictions could result in a default under the 2020 Jackson Note, under which Jackson may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings under the 2020 Jackson Note, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nFurthermore, our Certificate of Incorporation specifies that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders, which may include federal claims and derivative actions, except that if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction over such claims (including subject matter jurisdiction), the sole and exclusive forum for such claim shall be the federal district court for the District of Delaware. We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, these provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. Specifically, the choice of forum provision in requiring that the state courts of the State of Delaware be the exclusive forum for certain suits would (i) not be enforceable with respect to any suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act and (ii) have uncertain enforceability with respect to claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The choice of forum provision in the Certificate of Incorporation does not have the effect of causing our stockholders to have waived our obligation to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe may not meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, which could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). We have in the past, and may in the future, be unable to comply with certain of the listing standards that we are required to meet to maintain the listing of our common shares on Nasdaq.\nOn April 27, 2021, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq (the \u201cStaff\u201d) indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business day period between March 12, 2021 through April 27, 2021, we did not meet the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cBid Price Requirement\u201d). On July 27, 2021, we received notice from Nasdaq indicating that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nOn February 23, 2022, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications of Nasdaq notifying us that we were no longer in compliance with the Bid Price Requirement, for continued listing on Nasdaq. Pursuant to the Panel Decision (as defined below) dated June 28, 2021, we were not eligible for the 180-day bid price compliance period set forth in the Listing Rules. As a result, we were subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless we timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d). We had a hearing before the Panel on March 30, 2022, which automatically stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the issuance of a decision by the Panel following the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. On April 12, 2022, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying us that the Panel determined to grant our request for continued listing on Nasdaq, subject to the following: (i) on or about May 2, 2022, we advised the Panel of the status of the proxy statement it plans to file to obtain shareholder approval for a reverse stock split, (ii) on or about May 23, 2022, we advised the Panel on the status of the shareholder meeting we plan to hold to obtain approval of the reverse stock split, (iii) on or about May 26, 2022, we will affect a reverse stock split and (iv) on or before about June 22, 2022, we shall demonstrate compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by evidencing a closing bid price above $1.00 per share for the previous ten consecutive trading sessions. On April 19, 2022, we received a letter from the Staff notifying us that as we had not yet filed our Form 10-K for the period ended January 1, 2022, such matter serves as an additional basis for delisting our securities from Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A). On May 4, 2022 the Panel granted us an extension request until July 11, 2022 to demonstrate compliance with the bid price requirement. On May 20, 2022, we received a notice from the Staff notifying us that as we had not yet filed our Form 10-Q for the period ended April 2, 2022, such matter serves as a basis for delisting our securities from Nasdaq in addition to the aforementioned matters.\nOn June 3, 2020, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying us that we were no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) to maintain stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2,500,000. A hearing before the Panel was held on January 21, 2021, and we were granted an extension to regain compliance until February 28, 2021, which was subsequently further extended to May 31, 2021 (the \u201cPanel Decision\u201d). On June 11, 2021, we received a letter from the Staff notifying us that the Panel had determined to delist our shares from Nasdaq and that trading in our shares would be suspended effective at the open of business on June 15, 2021 but that due to a procedural issue, the Panel determined not to implement the decision and afforded us an opportunity to make an additional submission for the Panel\u2019s consideration. On June 28, 2021, we received a letter from the Staff informing us that we had regained compliance with the Rule. As a result, the Panel determined to continue the listing of the Company\u2019s securities on Nasdaq. The Panel also determined to impose a Panel Monitor under Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(A) for a period of one year from the date of the June 28, 2021 letter (the \u201cMonitoring Period\u201d). We are expected to remain in compliance with all of Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements during the Monitoring Period. If at any time during this period we fail to satisfy any continued listing standard, the Staff will issue a Delist Determination Letter, which we may appeal.\nIf Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of or obtain our shares, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our shares could be severely limited. We additionally may not be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, which could result in our securities being quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nA more active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range. Between our stock splits occurring on September 17, 2015, and January 3, 2018, our common stock traded in a range from $135.10 to $3,071.90 per share, and between our stock splits on January 3, 2018 and June 30, 2021, our common stock traded in a range from $16.80 to $339.00 per share. Subsequent to June 30, 2021 through March 31, 2022, our common stock traded in a range from $6.50 to $67.50 per share. There has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for our common stock, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop or may not be sustained. Limited liquidity in the trading market for our common stock may adversely affect a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell its shares of common stock at the time it wishes to sell them or at a price that it considers acceptable. If a more active, liquid public trading market does not develop we may be limited in our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration. In addition, if there is a thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile and it would be harder for a stockholder to liquidate any investment in our common stock. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n\u25cf our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in our earnings estimates;\n\u25cf investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u25cf our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u25cf changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n\u25cf announcements of legislative or regulatory changes.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in the staffing industry. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nWe may reduce or suspend our dividend in the future.\nWe initiated a dividend program in early 2019 under which we intended to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share to holders of our common stock. The first such dividend was paid on February 28, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2019, but subsequent dividends were suspended by our Board. In the future, our Board may, without advance notice, determine to initiate, reduce or suspend our dividends in order to maintain our financial flexibility and best position our Company for long-term success. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements and other factors and restrictions our Board deems relevant. In addition, we are limited in our ability to pay dividends by certain of our existing agreements. In particular, our debt agreements only permit us to pay a quarterly cash dividend of one cent per share of common stock issued and outstanding, provided, that such cash dividend does not exceed $100 in the aggregate per fiscal quarter. We may not pay such dividends if any events of default exist under our debt agreements.\nAccordingly, we cannot be certain if we will be able to pay quarterly cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must mainly rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the primary way to realize any future gains on their investment. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nUpon our dissolution, you may not recoup all or any portion of your investment.\nIn the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the proceeds and/or assets of our Company remaining after giving effect to such transaction, and the payment of all of our debts and liabilities will be distributed to the stockholders of common stock on a pro rata basis. There can be no assurance that we will have available assets to pay to the holders of common stock, or any amounts, upon such a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our Company. In this event, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur growth of operations could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer.\nWhile we plan to continue growing our business organically through expansion, sales efforts, and strategic acquisitions, while maintaining tight controls on our expenses and overhead, lean overhead functions combined with focused growth may place a strain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources, resulting in internal control failures, missed opportunities, and staff attrition which could impact our business and results of operations.\nOur strategy of growing through acquisitions may impact our business in unexpected ways.\nOur growth strategy involves acquisitions that help us expand our service offerings and diversify our geographic footprint. We continuously evaluate acquisition opportunities, but there are no assurances that we will be able to identify acquisition targets that complement our strategy and are available at valuation levels accretive to our business.\nEven if we are successful in acquiring, our acquisitions may subject our business to risks that may impact our results of operation:\n\u25cf inability to integrate acquired companies effectively and realize anticipated synergies and benefits from the acquisitions;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration of the acquired businesses at the expense of delivering results for the legacy business;\n\u25cf inability to appropriately scale critical resources to support the business of the expanded enterprise and other unforeseen challenges of operating the acquired business as part of our operations;\n\u25cf inability to retain key employees of the acquired businesses and/or inability of such key employees to be effective as part of our operations;\n\u25cf impact of liabilities of the acquired businesses undiscovered or underestimated as part of the acquisition due diligence;\n\u25cf failure to realize anticipated growth opportunities from a combined business, because existing and potential clients may be unwilling to consolidate business with a single supplier or to stay with the acquirer post acquisition;\n\u25cf impacts of cash on hand and debt incurred to finance acquisitions, thus reducing liquidity for other significant strategic objectives; and\n\u25cf internal controls, disclosure controls, corruption prevention policies, human resources and other key policies and practices of the acquired companies may be inadequate or ineffective.\nGlobal, market and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nConcerns over inflation, geopolitical issues, the U.S. financial markets, foreign exchange rates, capital and exchange controls, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to periods of significant economic instability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward, and increased unemployment rates. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturns, volatile business environments and continued unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. If these conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current or future service providers and other partners could be negatively affected by difficult economic times, which could adversely affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget or meet our business and financial objectives.\nIn addition, we face several risks associated with international business and are subject to global events beyond our control, including war, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, trade disputes, economic sanctions, trade wars and their collateral impacts and other international events. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. There may be changes to our business if there is instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. In February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The sanctions announced by the United States and other countries, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine against Russia to date include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services or technology in or from affected regions and travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business and financial organizations in Russia. The United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets, all of which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on attracting, integrating, managing, and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon our ability to attract, integrate, manage and retain personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to fulfill our customers\u2019 needs. Our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel could be impaired by any diminution of our reputation, decrease in compensation levels relative to our competitors or modifications to our total compensation philosophy or competitor hiring programs. If we cannot attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our future success also depends upon our ability to manage the performance of our personnel. Failure to successfully manage the performance of our personnel could affect our profitability by causing operating inefficiencies that could increase operating expenses and reduce operating income. An overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market in the U.S. employment market generally, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been recently observed in the U.S. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate and our overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified temporary workers.\nIn addition to the members of our own team, our success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit and retain qualified temporary workers who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our customers. We are required to continually evaluate our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing customer needs. Competition for individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and demand for these individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that qualified personnel will continue to be available.\nIf we are unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers, our business and results of operations could suffer.\nIncreasing the growth and profitability of our business is particularly dependent upon our ability to retain existing customers and capture additional customers. Our ability to do so is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality services and offer competitive prices. If we are unable to execute these tasks effectively, we may not be able to attract a significant number of new customers and our existing customer base could decrease, either or both of which could have an adverse impact on our business and revenues.\nWe are dependent upon technology services, and if we experience damage, service interruptions or failures in our computer and telecommunications systems, our customer relationships and our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected.\nOur business could be interrupted by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems, and we may lose data. Our customers\u2019 businesses may be adversely affected by any system or equipment failure we experience. As a result of any of the foregoing, our relationships with our customers may be impaired, we may lose customers, our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected and we could be exposed to contractual liability. Precautions in place to protect us from, or minimize the effect of, such events may not be adequate. If an interruption by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems occurs, we could be liable and the market perception of our services could be harmed.\nOur management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the lack of a sufficient complement of competent finance personnel to appropriately account for, review and disclose the completeness and accuracy of transactions entered into by the Company. This material weakness, if not remediated, could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We may be unable to develop, implement and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission rules require that our management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. Among other things, our management must conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nA \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended January 1, 2022, we and our auditors identified a material weakness (as such term is defined below) in our internal control over financial reporting. We lack a sufficient complement of competent finance personnel to appropriately account for, review, and disclose the completeness and accuracy of transactions entered into by the Company. As part of our remediation plan, we plan to hire additional employees and external consultants who have the technical skillset to improve our financial reporting; implement new policies, procedures and controls; properly review transactions recorded and classified in the financial statements; and ensure proper accounting and related disclosures for complex accounting matters when necessary both in the United States and United Kingdom.\nAlthough we are working to remedy the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting discussed above, and have so far implemented additional controls relating to payroll, treasury, and accounts payable, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully developed, when it will be fully implemented or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that our future consolidated financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. Further and continued determinations that there are material weaknesses in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting relating the above items could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures of both money and our management\u2019s time to comply with applicable requirements.\nAny failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, or could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. These misstatements could result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, reduce our ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThe ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require us to identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the Company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIn addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, cause downgrades in our future debt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could, in turn, negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.\nOur compliance with complicated regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure has resulted in additional expenses.\nWe are faced with expensive, complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. In addition, as a staffing company, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and often by state authorities. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing compliance work.\nOur failure to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nThe requirements of being a public company place significant demands on our resources.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq, have imposed various requirements on public companies. New laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and changes in required accounting practices and rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements.\nShareholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage.", "PERMNO": 15662, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "STAF"}
