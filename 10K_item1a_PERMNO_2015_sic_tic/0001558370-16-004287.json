{"cik": "1251769", "company": "LPATH, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before you decide to buy our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business would likely suffer and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our securities.\nRisks primarily associated with our business:\nWe may not be successful in negotiating and consummating a strategic transaction.\nOur Board of Directors has engaged a financial advisory firm to explore our available strategic alternatives to obtain the capital required to fund our future operations or otherwise enhance stockholder value, including possible mergers and business combinations, a sale of part or all of our assets, collaboration and licensing arrangements and/or equity and debt financings. This strategic process is both active and ongoing, and includes a range of interactions with potential transaction counterparties. We believe it is in our stockholders\u2019 best interests at this time to continue to pursue one or more of these transactions, or other strategic alternatives we may identify in the near term. Although we are actively pursuing our strategic alternatives, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate and consummate a transaction on a timely basis, or at all. Further, our expenses may exceed our current plans and expectations, which could require us to complete a transaction or wind-down our operations sooner than anticipated. Additionally, any transaction we consummate may offer limited value for our existing drug candidates and proprietary technology and may not enhance stockholder value or provide the expected benefits. If we are unable to successfully complete a strategic transaction or otherwise secure additional capital on a timely basis and on terms that are acceptable to our stockholders, we may be required to cease our operations altogether.\nWe will require, and may not be able to obtain, substantial additional financial resources in order to carry out our planned activities and to continue as a going concern beyond the third quarter of 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $8.9 million. Although we may receive limited additional funding under our existing NIH grants, our existing cash resources are not sufficient to meet our operating plan for the full 12 month period after the date of this filing, and we may not be able to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the report from our independent registered public accounting firm accompanying the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an emphasis of a matter regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. To help extend our operating window, we have reduced our headcount and limited our research and product development activities. Based on our current plans and available resources, we believe we can maintain our current operations through the end of the third quarter of 2016. We estimate that the costs to wind-down our operations in an orderly manner will cost approximately $2.5 million. As a result, we need to secure significant additional capital to continue to fund our operations and our drug discovery and development projects beyond the third quarter of 2016. Moreover, our expenses may exceed our current plans and expectations, which would require us to secure additional capital or wind-down our operations sooner than anticipated. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us or to our stockholders. If we are unable complete a strategic transaction or otherwise raise funds to satisfy our capital needs on a timely basis and control our operating costs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate our business beyond the third quarter of 2016.\nOur current product candidate portfolio is limited and in the early stages of development.\nIn May 2015, we announced that our multicenter, Phase 2 \u201cNexus\u201d clinical trial evaluating iSONEP in patients with wet AMD did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints. Based on long-term follow-up data suggesting that iSONEP, when used in combination with anti-VEGF treatments, may result in reductions in total wet AMD lesion area and may allow patients to maintain their visual acuity gains for longer periods of time than anti-VEGF treatments alone, we are pursuing licensing, partnering and other strategic alternatives to help fund further clinical investigation of iSONEP, but there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Additionally, in March 2015, we announced that our Phase 2a single-agent, open-label study of ASONEP did not meet the primary endpoint of statistically significant progression-free survival in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We are exploring other indications where ASONEP may have a greater chance of success, but there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. In addition, although we recently completed the dosing phase of a Phase 1 clinical trial for our third product candidate, Lpathomab we do not have sufficient funds at this point to pursue additional clinical work on Lpathomab. Moreover, even if we can raise additional funds, there is no assurance that we can successfully develop Lpathomab, prove it to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials, or meet applicable regulatory standards. In addition, our ImmuneY2\u2122 process of generating monoclonal antibodies against lipid mediators may not be successful against future targets. As such, there\ncan be no assurance that we will be able to develop a monoclonal antibody against our future targets, and thus, we may fail to generate additional clinical candidates for our pipeline. Moreover, given the early stage of development of our current clinical and preclinical drug candidates, we may not be successful in entering into collaboration or license agreements for these drug candidates, which could limit our ability to raise the funds required to support our operations and the future development of these drug candidates.\nWe are in the early stages of drug development, and we may be unable to generate significant revenues and may never become profitable.\nWe are in the early stages of drug development, and have not received FDA approval for marketing any of our drug candidates. We have generated approximately $55.0 million in revenues from inception through December 31, 2015 and, as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $76.1 million. We expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and seek regulatory approval for our drug candidates. We cannot provide any assurance that any of our drug candidates will prove to be clinically significant or will receive regulatory approval. For example, we reported that two of our drug candidates, iSONEP and ASONEP, failed to meet the endpoints of the Phase 2 clinical trials we conducted for these drug candidates. Even if the drug candidates were to receive any regulatory approval, there can no assurance that we could provide for their effective marketing and sales, either by ourselves or in partnership with others. Consequently there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitability and, even if we achieve profitability, that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of drug development.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support either further clinical development or the commercialization of our product candidates.\nEven if we complete clinical trials for our drug candidates as planned, the results from these clinical trials may not support either the further clinical development or the commercialization of our product-candidates. For example, on May 20, 2015, we announced that our multicenter, Phase 2 \u201cNexus\u201d clinical trial evaluating iSONEP in patients with wet AMD did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints. Wet AMD patients who participated in our Nexus trial did not show statistically significant improvement in visual acuity when treated with iSONEP as an adjunctive or monotherapy. Based on these results, Pfizer Inc. did not elect to exercise its contractual option to obtain worldwide rights to iSONEP, and its contractual option expired, unexercised. Based on long-term follow-up data suggesting that iSONEP, when used in combination with anti-VEGF treatments, may result in reductions in total wet AMD lesion area and may allow patients to maintain their visual acuity gains for longer periods of time than anti-VEGF treatments alone, we are pursuing licensing, partnering and other strategic alternatives to help fund further clinical investigation of iSONEP, but there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Additionally, on March 24, 2015, we announced that our Phase 2a single-agent, open-label study of ASONEP\u2122 did not meet the primary endpoint of statistically significant progression- free survival in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We are exploring other indications where ASONEP may have a greater chance of success, but there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.\nMoreover, based on the results of our preclinical studies with Lpathomab, we elected to submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for Lpathomab with the FDA, and completed the dosing phase in the Phase 1a clinical trial of Lpathomab. The follow-up period for patients in the Phase 1a trial will be completed in March 2016, and we expect the final study results, including pharmacokinetic, pharmcodynamic, and safety data, to be available in the second quarter of 2016. The results from this Phase 1 clinical trial on Lpathomab may be different from our preclinical studies and may not support further clinical development and/or the commercialization of Lpathomab. The same is true for any of our existing and future drug candidates. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results from any later clinical trials may not replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans, effective for indicated uses, or commercially viable given the competitive environment and reimbursement issues. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.\nIn addition, we or the FDA may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in any INDs or the conduct of these trials. A number of companies in the biotechnology and drug development industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials despite promising results in earlier trials. In the end, we may be unable to develop marketable products.\nFurther, we have not obtained an agreement with the FDA that the design of our planned studies for any of our drug candidates would be sufficient to lead to product approval even if the results are positive. Moreover, we have not developed or reached an agreement with the FDA on the detailed statistical analysis plan that will be used to analyze the data from these clinical trials. Regulatory agencies also may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe could be delisted from NASDAQ, which could seriously harm the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital or complete a strategic transaction\nIn July 2015, we received a letter (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the Listing Qualifications staff (the \u201cStaff\u201d) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of the our common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, we no longer met the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(1). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 5, 2016, in which to regain compliance. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, we anticipate that our shares of common stock would trade on the OTC bulletin board. In order to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period. Because we did not regain compliance within this 180-day period, we requested and received on January 6, 2016, an additional compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until July 5, 2016. In order to be eligible for this additional compliance period, we had to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement. During this second compliance period, we intend to cure the deficiency, by seeking approval from our stockholders to effect a reverse stock split. However, we cannot provide assurance that our stockholders will approve the reverse stock split, or that we will be able to cure the deficiency in our bid price during this second compliance period. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements on a timely basis, we cannot assure you that our common stock will continue to be listed on Nasdaq beyond July 5, 2016.\nA delisting from Nasdaq and commencement of trading on the OTC bulletin board would likely result in a reduction in some or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our stockholders:\n\u00b7\nthe liquidity of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nthe market price of shares of our common stock (and the accompanying valuation of our company);\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain financing or complete a strategic transaction for the continuation of our operations;\n\u00b7\nthe number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in shares of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nthe number of market markers in shares of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of shares of our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nthe number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock.\nAll of these factors could hinder our ability to continue our operations beyond the third quarter of 2016.\nWe may have delays in completing our clinical trials and we may not complete them at all.\nWe have not completed the clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA approval to market any of our product candidates. The clinical trial process is also time consuming, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time or whether we will complete any of our clinical trials on schedule, or at all. In addition, any future clinical trials we pursue may be delayed or terminated in the future as a result of many factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nnot have sufficient funding to support the clinical trial;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in securing centers to conduct trials;\n\u00b7\nslower than expected patient enrollment or lack of a sufficient number of patients that meet the enrollment criteria for our clinical trials and our inability to change our clinical protocols to respond to such delays;\n\u00b7\npatients failing to complete clinical trials due to safety issues, treatment protocol requirements, side effects, dissatisfaction with the product candidate, or other reasons;\n\u00b7\nunexpected adverse reactions by patients or a temporary suspension or complete ban on trials of our products due to adverse side effects;\n\u00b7\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols;\n\u00b7\ninability to change clinical trial protocols if we experience unexpected delays;\n\u00b7\ninability to maintain or manufacture a supply of the investigational drug or the active comparators in sufficient quantities to support the trials;\n\u00b7\ndisagreements with our collaborators on clinical trial protocols or design;\n\u00b7\ndelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective clinical testing sites;\n\u00b7\nregulators or Institutional Review Boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nregulators or Institutional Review Boards may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or concerns about patient safety;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA instituting future clinical holds on our clinical trials, and delays or failure of the FDA to remove such clinical holds;\n\u00b7\nwe may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if we believe that they expose the participating patients to unacceptable risks or for other reasons;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment may prevent us from collecting the data required by our study protocols;\n\u00b7\nproduct candidates demonstrating a lack of efficacy during clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental or regulatory delays, changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines;\n\u00b7\ncompetition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians; and\n\u00b7\ndelays in completing data collection and analysis for clinical trials.\nIn the past, we have experienced significant delays in our clinical trials for one or more of the reasons outlined above. For example, in January 2012, the FDA placed our clinical trials on hold 2012 following a determination by the FDA that our fill-and-finish contractor that had filled the iSONEP clinical trial vials was not in compliance with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u2018\u2018cGMP\u2019\u2019) standards during the time period it provided those services to the Company. Thereafter, we were required to manufacture new drug product, which resulting in our inability to resume dosing patients until September 2012.\nIn addition, we rely on academic institutions, hospitals and medical centers, physician practices and clinical research organizations to conduct, supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates. We have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own. Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol, applicable regulations or good clinical practices. We also rely on clinical research organizations to perform our data management and analysis. They may not provide these services as required or in a timely or compliant manner. If the delays or costs are significant, our financial results and ability to commercialize our products will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls or require us to cease operations sooner than anticipated.\nOur operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe time and resources required to complete a financing, licensing arrangement or strategic transaction;\n\u00b7\nthe time and resources required to develop our product candidates, conduct pre-clinical and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, and create effective sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe costs required to wind-down our operations;\n\u00b7\nthe time and costs of manufacturing additional supplies of our investigational drug or obtaining the active comparators for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe expenses we incur for research and development required to develop our drug candidates and to maintain and improve our technology;\n\u00b7\nthe costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation.\nIn addition, our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues. However, our ability to generate any revenues depends largely on the progress of our drug candidates through clinical trials, and ultimately on receiving marketing approval from the FDA, which is difficult to forecast accurately. We may be unable to adjust our operations in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenues. As a result, a significant shortfall in our planned revenues could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe must obtain governmental approval for each of our products, which is an expensive and complicated process in which any number of problems could arise that would adversely affect our business.\nOur product candidates target lipids, as opposed to proteins, and the FDA has not previously approved any similar product. Thus, we may encounter unexpected safety, efficacy, or manufacturing issues as we seek to obtain\nregulatory approval, and we may never receive approval from the FDA or other governmental authorities for our drug candidates.\nThe development, production and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the United States and most other developed countries. The process of obtaining approval from the FDA in the United States requires conducting extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. We have limited experience in, and limited resources available for, regulatory and clinical activities. Any of the following events relating to the regulatory approval of our drug candidates can occur and, if any did occur, any one could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations:\n\u00b7\ninability to successfully complete our clinical trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and FDA regulations;\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical trials not yielding sufficiently conclusive favorable data for regulatory agencies to approve the use of our products in development, or any other products we may acquire or in-license;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities may place a clinical trial on clinical hold;\n\u00b7\ndelays, sometimes long delays, in obtaining approval for our product candidates, including, but not limited, to requests for additional clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the rules and regulations governing the approval process for product candidates such as ours during the testing and review period, which can result in the need to spend time and money for further testing or review;\n\u00b7\nthe authorized use of any product, if approved, is more limited than required for commercial success, or approval is conditioned on completion of further clinical trials or other activities; and\n\u00b7\nany approval being withdrawn, or limited, if previously unknown problems arise with our human-use product or data arising from its use.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations can, among other things, result in non-approval, suspensions of regulatory approvals, fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions and criminal prosecution.\nA source of revenue, grant funds from the National Institutes for Health, may not continue to be a source of revenue in the future.\nAlthough we have applied for and been awarded grants in the past, the National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) may not in the future find our applications worthy of such grants.\nIn addition, the NIH requires audits of those recipients of grant funds exceeding $500,000 in any year, a threshold that we have exceeded in 2014. Such audits test the allowability and allocation of expenditures and ultimately compliance with OMB Circular A-133 audit requirements. There can be no assurance that we will pass such an audit, and failure to pass could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our business operations.\nOur drug-development programs depend upon third-party researchers who are outside our control.\nWe depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities, medical institutions, and clinical research organizations to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. Such agreements are often standard-form agreements typically not subject to extensive negotiation. These investigators or collaborators are not our employees, and in general we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. These investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA\napplications, if any, and our introduction of new drugs, if any, will be delayed. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us.\nOur collaborations with outside scientific and clinical advisors may be subject to restriction and change.\nWe work with scientific and clinical advisors at academic and other institutions who are experts in the fields of oncology, ophthalmology, pain, traumatic brain injury, and autoimmune disorders (such as multiple sclerosis). They assist us in our research and development efforts and advise us with respect to our clinical trials. These advisors are not our employees and may have other commitments that would limit their future availability to us. Although our scientific and clinical advisors and collaborators generally agree not to engage in competing work, if a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity, we may lose their services, which may impair our reputation in the industry and delay the clinical development of our drug candidates.\nWe are dependent on third-party manufacturers, over whom we have limited control, to manufacture our products.\nThe manufacturing process of iSONEP, ASONEP, Lpathomab, and any other therapeutic products we may want to evaluate or commercialize involves a number of steps and requires compliance with stringent quality control specifications imposed by us and by the FDA. Moreover, our proposed products may be manufactured only in a facility that has undergone a satisfactory inspection and certification by the FDA. We do not have any manufacturing facilities ourselves and expect to rely on one or more third-party manufacturers to properly manufacture our products currently in clinical development as well as any other products we may develop or in-license. We may not be able to quickly replace our manufacturing capacity if we were unable to use a third party\u2019s manufacturing facilities as a result of a fire, natural disaster (including an earthquake), equipment failure or other difficulty, or if such facilities are deemed not in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements, and the noncompliance could not be rapidly rectified. For example, in January 2012, we temporarily suspended dosing patients in our PED and wet AMD trials, because we learned from the FDA that our fill-and-finish contractor, Formatech, Inc., was not in compliance with cGMP requirements during the period in August 2010 that the iSONEP clinical vials were filled. After we suspended dosing, we were notified by the FDA that the iSONEP trials were being placed on clinical hold. Thereafter, we were required to manufacture new drug product, which resulting in our inability to resume dosing patients until September 2012.\nIn addition, we may not be able to maintain our relationship with any manufacturer we select. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current manufacturer\u2019s capabilities could harm our ability to manufacturer such products until new manufacturers are identified and qualified, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business and results.\nAdditionally, our inability or reduced capacity to have our products manufactured would prevent us from successfully evaluating or commercializing our proposed products. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our proposed products may adversely affect our profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver proposed products on a timely and competitive basis. Any delays in formulation and manufacturing objectives may cause a delay in our clinical program, and could have an adverse effect on the price of our shares.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market any products we may develop, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA, we must build a sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. In addition, we have no experience in developing, training or managing a sales force and will incur substantial additional expenses in doing so. The cost of establishing and maintaining a sales force may exceed its cost effectiveness. Furthermore, we will compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Our marketing and sales efforts may be unable to compete successfully against these companies. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.\nPhysicians and patients may not accept and use our drugs.\nEven if the FDA approves our initial lead products (or any other product we attempt to commercialize), physicians and patients may not accept and use it. Acceptance and use of any of our future products, if approved, will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u00b7\nperceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs;\n\u00b7\ncost-effectiveness of our drugs or diagnostic products relative to competing products;\n\u00b7\navailability of reimbursement from government or other healthcare payors for our products; and\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our third-party collaborators, if any.\nBecause we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of any of these drugs to find market acceptance, subsequent to approval, would severely harm our business.\nOur industry is highly competitive, so even if our products ultimately get approved by the FDA, our success depends on our ability to sustain competitive advantages.\nThe pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are very competitive, fast moving and intense, and, are expected to be increasingly so in the future. Other companies have developed and are developing drugs that, if not similar in type to our drugs, are designed to provide comparable clinical significance. Therefore, our lead products, other products we may develop, or any other products we may acquire or in-license may not be, or may not be perceived to be, the most efficacious (at all or for a majority of patients), the safest, the first to market, or the most economical to make or use. If a competitor\u2019s product is, or is perceived to be, more advantageous than ours, for whatever reason, then we could make less money from sales, if we are able to generate sales at all.\nThere are many reasons why a competitor might be more successful than we are, including:\n\u00b7\nMany competitors have greater financial resources and can afford more technical and development setbacks than we can.\n\u00b7\nMany competitors have been in the drug-discovery and drug-development business longer than we have. They have greater experience than we have in critical areas like clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approval, and sales and marketing. This experience and their name recognition give them a competitive advantage over us.\n\u00b7\nSome competitors may have a better patent position protecting their technology than we have or will have to protect our technology. If we cannot use our proprietary rights to prevent others from copying our technology or developing similar technology, then our competitive position will be harmed.\n\u00b7\nSome companies with competitive technologies may move through stages of development, approval, and marketing faster than we do. If a competitor receives FDA approval before we do, then it will be authorized to sell its products before we can sell ours. Because the first company \u201cto market\u201d often has a significant advantage over latecomers, a second-place position could result in less-than-anticipated sales.\nThe United States Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to challenge patent validity or create modified, non-infringed versions of a drug in order to facilitate the approval of abbreviated new drug application for generic substitutes. These same incentives also encourage manufacturers to submit new drug applications, known as 505(b)(2) applications, that rely on literature and clinical data\nnot originally obtained by the drug sponsor. In light of these incentives and especially if our lead products (or our other drug candidates in development or any other products we may acquire or in-license) are commercially successful, other manufacturers may submit and gain successful approval for either an abbreviated new drug application or a 505(b)(2) application that will compete directly with our products. Such competition will likely cause a reduction in our revenues.\nIf Medicare and other third-party payors, including managed care organizations, do not provide adequate reimbursement for our drugs or our diagnostic products, if commercialized, the commercial success of our product candidates could be compromised.\nOur ability to earn sufficient returns on our products will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for our products and related treatments will be available from third party payors, including state and federal government authorities, private health insurers and health maintenance and managed care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit both the coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drug products to contain costs. Consequently, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Third party payors may not establish adequate levels of reimbursement for the products that we commercialize, which could limit their market acceptance and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nReimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that our product candidates, if commercialized, are: experimental or investigational; not medically necessary; not appropriate for the specific patient or clinical indication; or not cost-effective.\nReimbursement by Medicare may require a review that will be lengthy and that will be performed under the provisions of a National Coverage Decision process with payment limits as the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) determines appropriate. We cannot guarantee that the Secretary of HHS will act to approve any of our products, if commercialized, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, there have been and will most likely continue to be significant efforts by both federal and state agencies to reduce costs in government healthcare programs and otherwise implement government control of healthcare costs. Any future changes in Medicare reimbursement that may come about as a result of enactment of healthcare reform or of deficit-reduction legislation will likely continue the downward pressure on reimbursement rates. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States may continue to pressure the pricing of healthcare services. In certain countries outside the United States, pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control. Third party payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. In addition, government and other third-party payors increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for many drugs and diagnostic products. If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, it may adversely affect our business. Since policy-level reimbursement approval is required from each private payor individually, seeking such approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. If we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement approval from Medicare and private payors for any of our products, or if the amount reimbursed is inadequate, our ability to generate revenue will be limited.\nWe may incur significant or currently undeterminable costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations.\nWe use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. As appropriate, we will store these materials and wastes resulting from their use at our or our outsourced laboratory facility pending their ultimate use or disposal. We will contract with a third party to properly dispose of these materials and wastes. We will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. We may also incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations adopted in the future.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nThe development, manufacture, and sale of pharmaceutical products expose us to the risk of significant losses resulting from product liability claims. Although we intend to obtain and maintain product liability insurance to offset some of this risk, we may be unable to secure such insurance or it may not cover certain proven claims against us.\nWe may not be able to afford to obtain insurance due to rising costs in insurance premiums in recent years. If we are able to secure insurance coverage, we may be faced with a successful claim against us in excess of our product liability coverage that could result in a material adverse impact on our business. If insurance coverage is too expensive or is unavailable to us, we may be forced to self-insure against product-related claims. Without insurance coverage, a successful claim against us and any defense costs incurred in defending ourselves may have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nIf we lose the services of key management personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Atkinson, our Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer, Dario Paggiarino, M.D., and our Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Gary Woodnutt, Ph.D. are critical to our overall management as well as the development of our technology, our culture and our direction. Our business and prospects depends in part on our ability to identify and retain a permanent Chief Executive Officer who can assist us in executing on our business plan.\nNone of our executive officers and key employees has long-term employment contracts with us, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The failure to identify and retain a permanent Chief Executive Officer or the loss of any of our management or key personnel could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. We expect that as more companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries establish programs to discover drugs that target bioactive lipids, the demand for scientists with experience working with bioactive lipids will increase. As that demand increases, it is likely that certain of our competitors will directly target certain of our employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nWe may also need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies and other emerging entrepreneurial companies, as well as universities and research institutions. Competition for such individuals, particularly in the Southern California area, is intense. Even though the current economic conditions have somewhat softened demand for qualified personnel, we expect that over the longer term we will continue to face stiff competition and may not be able to successfully recruit or retain such personnel. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate\ncoverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits to offset future taxable income or future tax will be limited and may be limited further in the future due to changes in ownership (within the meaning of IRC Section 382) that have occurred and may occur in the future.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income, and an ownership change is generally defined as a cumulative change of 50% or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders during a rolling three year period. Ownership changes may occur in the future, which could eliminate or restrict our ability to use NOL carry forwards and research and development tax credits. In addition, the California state government suspended the use of existing California NOL carryforwards in some years, such as 2010 and 2011. In those years companies have not been permitted to utilize NOL carryforwards to reduce the amount of taxes payable to the state. If that fiscal policy were to continue then the California benefits could be deferred, modified, or lost.\nLimitations on our ability to use NOL carry forwards and research and development tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal and state income taxes earlier than would be required if such limitations were not in effect.\nRisks associated with our intellectual property:\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and our inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are critically important assets to us. Events outside of our control could jeopardize our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. In addition, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming, and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could cause these costs to rise significantly and materially affect our operating results.\nWhile our goal is to obtain patent protection for our innovations, they may not be patentable or we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important for our business. Even if we do obtain protection for our innovations, the scope of protection gained may be insufficient or a patent issued may be deemed invalid or unenforceable, as the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent. The patenting process, enforcement of issued patents, and defense against claims of infringement are inherently costly and risky. We may not have the financial resources to defend our patents, thereby reducing our competitive position and our business prospects. Specific risks associated with the patent process include the following:\n\u00b7\nThe United States or foreign patent offices may not grant patents of meaningful scope based on the applications we have already filed and those we intend to file. If our current patents do not adequately protect our drug molecules and the indications for their use, then we will not be able to prevent imitation and any product may not be commercially viable.\n\u00b7\nSome of the issued patents we now license may be determined to be invalid. If we have to defend the validity of the patents that we have in-licensed, the costs of such defense could be substantial, and there is\nno guarantee of a successful outcome. In the event any of the patents we have in-licensed is found to be invalid, we may lose competitive position and may not be able to receive royalties for products covered in part or whole by that patent under license agreements.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products without providing any compensation to us. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights. For example, some countries, including many in Europe, do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans, and in these countries patent protection may not be available at all to protect our drug candidates.\n\u00b7\nAlthough we try to avoid infringement, there is the risk that we will use a patented technology owned by another person or entity and/or be sued for infringement. For example, U.S. patent applications are confidential while pending in the Patent and Trademark Office, and patent offices in foreign countries often publish patent applications for the first time six months or more after filing. Further, we may not be aware of published or granted conflicting patent rights. Any conflicts resulting from patent applications and patents of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection. In addition, defending or indemnifying a third party against a claim of infringement can involve lengthy and costly legal actions, and there can be no guarantee of a successful outcome.\nSpecifically, we have filed patents to protect our compositions of matter and methods to treat several disease states, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyperproliferative diseases, and angiogenesis. We do not know whether our claims will be granted. Even if we do obtain protection for our innovations, the scope of protection gained may be insufficient or a patent issued may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of this information could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally disclosed to others by our employees, which may cause us to lose any competitive advantage we enjoy from maintaining these trade secrets.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, which could require us to pay damages, and which could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nCompanies in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations by others of intellectual property rights. As our products get closer to commercialization, there is greater possibility that we may become subject to an infringement claim based on use of our technology such that we would be unable to continue using the technology without obtaining a license or settlement from third parties. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to alter the design of our technology to fall outside the scope of a third party patent, we may be unable to market some of our products, which would limit our prospects for profitability.\nAny intellectual property claims, whether merited or not, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate and could cause us to divert critical management and financial resources to the resolution of such claims. We may not be able to afford the costs of litigation. Any legal action against us or our collaborators or us could lead to:\n\u00b7\npayment of damages, potentially treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u00b7\ninjunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell products; or\n\u00b7\nwe or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nAs a result, an adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our products to the marketplace.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\nBecause we operate in the highly technical field of drug discovery and development, we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks primarily associated with our stock:\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or NASDAQ. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. Among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour limited resources and ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u00b7\nthe terms of any financing, licensing arrangement or strategic transaction we announce, if any;\n\u00b7\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nactions of investors that affect the market price;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in our operating expenses or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u00b7\nthe announcement of collaboration agreements to pursue further clinical development of our drug candidates;\n\u00b7\nsales of large blocks of our stock;\n\u00b7\ndepartures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the regulatory status of our product candidate or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of new products or technologies by competitors;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in the United States and other countries.\nIf shares of our common or preferred stock available for issuance or shares eligible for future sale were introduced into the market, it could hurt our stock price.\nWe are authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock. As of February 16, 2016, there were an aggregate of 39,655,016 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. That total includes 1,930,774 shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and 4,585,644 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. That total does not include 904,128 shares of common stock that have been reserved for future issuance under our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. The exercise of outstanding options and/or warrants or the future issuance of equity awards may cause substantial dilution to those who hold shares of common stock prior to such exercises or issuances.\nWe may sell our authorized, but unissued, common stock to satisfy our funding requirements. We are also authorized to issue 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without stockholder approval. The preferred stock may have rights that are superior to the rights of the holders of our common stock, at a purchase price then approved by our Board of Directors. The sale or the proposed sale of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock in the public markets may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our stock price. Our stockholders may also experience substantial dilution.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. The payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual arrangements, restrictions imposed by applicable law, any limitations on payments of dividends present in any debt agreements we may enter into and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. If we do not pay dividends, your ability to achieve a return on your investment in our company will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased their common stock.\nAs a public company, we may have to implement additional and expensive finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy new reporting requirements, which will increase our costs and require additional management resources.\nWe have limited resources and we intend to continue to spend most of our resources on research, development and other operational expenses. We are currently classified as a Smaller Reporting Company under Exchange Act regulations. Until we are classified as an Accelerated Filer (based upon our market capitalization reaching $75 million as of the applicable measuring date, among other requirements), we are exempt from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, relating to the attestation and reporting by our external auditing firm on our internal controls. However, if we were no longer exempt from compliance with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we would incur significant additional costs, which would be material to us and would affect our results of operations. In order to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, we may be required to expand disclosures and accelerate our financial reporting requirements. If we are unable to complete the required Section 404(b) assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, if we fail to maintain or implement adequate controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the date of our first\nForm 10-K for which compliance is required (compliance will not be required with respect to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, but could be required with respect to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 depending on the value of our public float as of June 30, 2016), our ability to obtain additional financing could be impaired. In addition, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting and in the accuracy of our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act. A lack of investor confidence in the reliability and accuracy of our public reporting could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, we could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOur governing documents provide indemnification for officers, directors and employees.\nOur governing instruments provide that officers, directors, employees and other agents shall only be liable to us for losses, judgments, liabilities and expenses for actions arising from actions not taken in good faith or of which indemnification would be otherwise unlawful in the performance of his or her obligations. Thus certain alleged errors or omissions might not be actionable by us. The governing instruments also provide that, under the broadest circumstances allowed under law, we must indemnify our officers, directors, employees and other agents for losses, judgments, liabilities, expenses, attorney\u2019s fees, and amounts paid in settlement of any claims sustained by them in connection with our Company, including liabilities under applicable securities laws.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws could make a third party acquisition of the Company difficult.\nOur board of directors is authorized to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock in series and, by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of Delaware, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock. Although our board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders, our board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock. Our board of directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or otherwise. We have no present plans to issue any preferred stock.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share as the shares you hold. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share of the shares you hold, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share as the shares you hold.\nIf securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 13648, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "APEN"}
