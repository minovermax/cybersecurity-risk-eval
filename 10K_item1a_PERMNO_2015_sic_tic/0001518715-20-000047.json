{"cik": "1518715", "company": "HomeStreet, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may not be able to meet our cost reduction and efficiency goals on the timeline we have projected or on the scale we have anticipated.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019, following the divestiture of our HLC-based mortgage business, we turned our focus to improving corporate efficiency in our continuing operations and implementing cost cutting measures across the organization, including setting goals for cost savings based on reductions in technology expenses and personnel as well as organizational restructuring. In the first quarter of 2020 we revised our previously disclosed expectations for the timeline on which we expect to meet these goals. We believe that we will be able to meet most if not all of these goals and now expect to substantially complete implementation of the related cost-cutting and efficiency measures before the end of the third quarter of 2021. However, we can offer no assurances that all of the cost cutting measures identified can be fully implemented, that the implementation can be completed within that time frame, or that other developments will not arise in the interim to make these cost cutting measures less feasible or have less impact on the efficiency of the organization. We may not be successful in renegotiating contracts for technology services, which may limit our ability to effectively cut costs in that area. We may incur additional unexpected costs as a part of the process which may lower the benefit of the cost cutting initiatives. If the cost cutting initiatives take longer to implement, if we are not able to implement them on the scale we anticipate, or if developments occur that limit or offset those cost savings in whole or in part, we may not be able to meet the efficiency and cost reduction goals we have set for the Company on the projected timeline or at all, which could adversely impact our overall results of operations and our stock price. We may not be successful in reducing our overall expenses and improving our efficiency ratio to the level of our peers in the near term, or at all.\nOur recent and proposed stock repurchases may not enhance our long-term shareholder value.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we began repurchasing shares of our outstanding common stock in open market transactions pursuant to a series of stock repurchase plans that were approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, as well as a one time negotiated transaction with an investor group in the third quarter of 2019. Through December 31, 2019 we repurchased an aggregate 3,187,259 shares for a total return to shareholders of approximately $98.5 million in capital. In January 2020, the Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase plan, conditioned on approval or non-objection from our regulators, which was recently obtained, of up to $25 million in additional outstanding shares of our common stock, negotiated transactions and otherwise, which we expect to begin in the first quarter of 2020. In February the Board increased the authorization by an additional $10 million conditional on the non-objection of our regulators. Assuming no objections from our regulators for the additional repurchase authorization, we expect to commence repurchases in the first or second quarter of 2020. While the intent of the repurchases is to return capital to shareholders to improve the long-term value of our stock, we cannot be assured that our stock repurchase programs will actually enhance long-term shareholder value. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase programs may affect our stock price and increase its volatility in the short term, and the existence of a stock repurchase program may also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and potentially may have reduced the market liquidity for our stock during the time the plan is in effect. Additionally, repurchases under our stock repurchase program have reduced our equity and regulatory capital ratios, which could impact our ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, in the short term our stock price may fluctuate and shareholders may not immediately see an increase to the value of their holdings.\nIf we are not able to retain or attract key employees, we could experience a disruption in our ability to implement our strategic plan which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company is going through a time of transition: in 2019 we divested our HLC-based mortgage business and have continued since that time to significantly reduce our employee headcount, slow the growth of our continuing operations and implement steps aimed at improving our profitability and efficiency. These transitions have resulted in some uncertainty among our continuing employees because we have also eliminated a number of corporate positions in order to improve the efficiency of our remaining operations and reduce our overhead expenses, which may cause some employees who we would want to retain, either in the near-term or long-term, to seek other opportunities. If a key employee or a substantial number of employees depart whom we were seeking to retain, it may negatively impact our ability to conduct business as usual. The low unemployment rates in many of our primary job markets, including Seattle, may leave us especially vulnerable to the loss of these employees. Similarly, this uncertainty may make it more challenging for us to attract and retain qualified and desirable candidates to fill open positions at the Company. The loss of key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nChanges in interest rates, competition in our industry, operational costs and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our profitability.\nFactors outside of our control, including changing interest rate environments, regulatory decisions, increased competition, a flattening yield curve and other forces of market volatility, can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations, including decreasing net interest income, decreasing profitability, increasing the cost of loan origination and adversely impacting our hedging strategies. For instance, the declining interest rate environment in the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in a temporary inversion of the yield curve, had an adverse impact on our net interest margin. Lower rates prompted an increase in loan prepayments, which reduced the overall yield of our loan portfolio because higher interest loans were replaced with loans originated with lower interest rates, impacting our results of operations. On the other hand, increases in interest rates in 2018, combined with other factors, negatively impacted our origination volume, especially with respect to single family mortgages. While we are subject to these market forces, we do not have any control over them and may not be able to predict changes that could have a significant impact on us.\nWe may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective hedging of interest rate risk related to our loans sold with retained servicing rights.\nBoth the value of our single family mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs, and the value of our single family loans held for sale change due to market forces including, among other things, fluctuations in interest rates that can impact the changing expectations of mortgage prepayment activity and speed. To mitigate potential losses of fair value of single family loans held for sale and MSRs related to changes in interest rates, we actively hedge this risk with financial derivative instruments. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models, experienced and skilled personnel and continual monitoring. Changes in the value of our hedging instruments may not correlate with changes in the value of our single family loans held for sale and MSRs, and our hedging activities may be impacted by unforeseen or unexpected changes. Therefore, our hedging activities may be insufficient or fail to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on single family loans held for sale and MSRs.\nNatural disasters or impacts of a pandemic in our geographic markets may negatively impact our financial results.\nOur primary markets are located in geographic regions that are at risk for earthquakes, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, floods, mudslides, outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics and other natural disasters. Certain communities in our markets have suffered significant losses from natural disasters, including devastating wildfires in California, Oregon and Washington, and volcanic eruptions and hurricanes in Hawaii. While the impacts of these natural disasters on our business have not been material to date, we have in the past had temporary office closures during these events and certain of our customers have experienced losses from these events.\nIn addition, our headquarters are located in King County, Washington, which has seen a higher initial infection and fatality rate from the COVID-19 virus than the rest of the United States, and most of our branches are located in states where cases of COVID-19 have already been identified. We may experience impacts from quarantines, market downturns and changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears and impacts on our workforce if the virus becomes widespread in any of our markets. We cannot predict the full impact of COVID-19 or any other future global pandemic on our business, but we could suffer financial losses as a result of the crisis. In addition, downturns in the global market related to pandemic fears could result in a lowering of interest rates as a stimulus to boost consumer spending, which could further negatively impact our results of operations.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in our markets, or if a more significant natural disaster or pandemic were to occur in the future, our operations in areas impacted by such events could experience an adverse financial impact due to office closures and market changes. In addition, our financial results could be impacted due to an inability of our customers to meet their loan commitments in a timely manner because of their losses, including a decrease in revenues for certain businesses in areas impacted by quarantines during a pandemic or other changes in consumer behavior, a reduction in housing inventory due to losses caused by natural disaster, and negative impacts to the local economy as it seeks to recover from these disasters.\nOur business is geographically confined to certain metropolitan areas of the Western United States, and events and conditions that disproportionately affect those areas may pose a more pronounced risk for our business.\nAlthough we presently have retail deposit branches in four states, with lending offices in these states and two others, a substantial majority of our revenues are derived from operations in the Puget Sound region of Washington, the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside and San Diego metropolitan areas in Southern California. All of our markets are located in the Western United States. Each of our primary markets is subject to various types of natural disasters, and many have experienced disproportionately significant economic volatility compared to the rest of the United States in the past. In addition, many of these areas have experienced a constriction in the availability of houses for sale in recent periods as new home construction has not kept pace with population growth in our primary markets, in part due to limitations on permitting and land availability. Economic events or natural disasters that affect the Western United States and our primary markets in that region, may have an unusually pronounced impact on our business. Because our operations are not more geographically diversified, we may lack the ability to mitigate those impacts from operations in other regions of the United States.\nThe significant concentration of real estate secured loans in our portfolio has had a negative impact on our asset quality and profitability in the past and there can be no assurance that it will not have such impact in the future.\nA substantial portion of our loans are secured by real property. Our real estate secured lending is generally sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in real estate sales and prices, significant increases in interest rates, unforeseen natural disasters and a decline in prevailing economic conditions may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, foreclosures, problem loans, other real estate owned (\"OREO\"), net charge-offs and provisions for credit and OREO losses. Although real estate prices are currently stable in the markets in which we operate, if market values decline significantly, as they did in the last recession, the collateral for our loans may provide less security and reduce our ability to recover the principal, interest and costs due on defaulted loans. Such declines may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose loan portfolios are more diversified.\nDeterioration in the real estate markets in which we operate and higher than normal delinquency and default rates on loans could cause other adverse consequences for us, including:\n\u2022\nReduced cash flows and capital resources, as we are required to make cash advances to meet contractual obligations to investors, process foreclosures, and maintain, repair and market foreclosed properties;\n\u2022\nDeclining mortgage servicing fee revenues because we recognize these revenues only upon collection;\n\u2022\nIncreasing mortgage servicing costs;\n\u2022\nDeclining fair value on our mortgage servicing rights; and\n\u2022\nDeclining fair values and liquidity of securities held in our investment portfolio that are collateralized by mortgage obligations.\nProxy contests commenced against the Company have caused us to incur substantial costs, diverted the attention of the Board of Directors and management, taken up management's attention and resources, caused uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business and adversely affected our business, operating results and financial condition, and future proxy contests could do so as well.\nA proxy contest or other activist campaign and related actions, such as the recent contest by Roaring Blue Lion Capital Management and related entities in 2018 and 2019, could have a material and adverse effect on us for the following reasons:\n\u2022\nActivist investors may attempt to effect changes in the Company's strategic direction and how the Company is governed, or to acquire control over the Company.\n\u2022\nWhile the Company welcomes the opinions of all shareholders, responding to proxy contests and related actions by activist investors could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management and employees away from their regular duties and the pursuit of business opportunities. In addition, there may be litigation in connection with a proxy contest, as was the case with our 2018 proxy fight, which would serve as a further distraction to our Board of Directors, senior management and employees and could require the Company to incur significant additional costs.\n\u2022\nPerceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of potential changes to the composition of the Board of Directors may lead to the perception of a change in the strategic direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors; may cause concern to our existing or potential customers and employees; may result in the loss of potential business opportunities; and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\n\u2022\nProxy contests and related actions by activist investors could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nWe may have deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting that we have not discovered which may result in our inability to maintain control over our assets or to identify and accurately report our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting are intended to ensure we maintain accurate records, promote the accurate and timely reporting of our financial information, maintain adequate control over our assets, and detect unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets. Effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud, and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nAs part of our ongoing monitoring of internal controls, from time to time we have discovered deficiencies in our internal controls that have required remediation. In the past, these deficiencies have included \"material weaknesses,\" defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nManagement has a process in place to document and analyze all identified internal control deficiencies and implement measures sufficient to remediate those deficiencies. To support our strategic initiatives, as well as to reflect the strategic shift in the business and to create operating efficiencies, we have implemented, and will continue to implement, new systems and processes. We will continue to realign our resources, including reductions in certain areas of corporate support operations, in line with our new strategies. If our change management processes are not sound and adequate resources are not deployed to support these implementations and changes, we may experience additional internal control deficiencies that could expose the Company to operating losses. Moreover, any failure to maintain effective controls or timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls in the future could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nOur allowance for credit losses may prove inadequate or we may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures. Future additions to our allowance for credit losses, as well as charge-offs in excess of reserves, will reduce our earnings.\nOur business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. As with most financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for credit losses to reflect potential defaults and nonperformance, which represents management's best estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management's estimate is based on our continuing evaluation of specific credit risks and loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, industry concentrations and other factors that may indicate future loan losses. Generally, our nonperforming loans and OREO reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers and weaknesses in the economies of the markets we serve. This allowance may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and future provisions for losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, the new accounting standard promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), regarding the recognition of credit losses. This standard makes significant changes to the accounting and disclosures for credit losses on financial instruments recorded on an amortized cost basis, including our loans held for investment. The new current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) impairment model requires an estimate of expected credit losses for financial assets measured over the contractual life of an instrument based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standard provides significant flexibility and requires a high degree of judgment in order to develop an estimate of expected lifetime losses. Providing for lifetime losses for our loan portfolio is a change to the previous method of allowances for loan losses that are based on probable and incurred losses over a short-term horizon. As it is a new model, we do not yet have experience with it and how it may perform in different business cycles or changes to our loan portfolio. The new methodology is likely to be much more sensitive to changes in inputs such as economic forecasts and other factors which may cause significant impact on the allowance, and could create volatility in the loan loss provision and net income particularly in periods of downturn. Regulators may impose additional capital buffers to absorb this volatility. Moreover, with the new model we have risk of complying with the new accounting standard which are still subject to review by our auditors and regulators.\nIn addition, as we acquired new operations, we added to our books the loans previously held by the acquired companies or related to the acquired branches, including loans acquired from Silvergate Bank in March 2019. If we make additional acquisitions in the future, we may bring additional loans originated by other institutions onto our books. Although we review loan quality as part of our due diligence in considering any acquisition involving loans, the addition of such loans may increase our credit risk exposure, require an increase in our allowance for credit losses, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows stemming from losses on those acquired loans.\nUncertainty relating to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. The Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, selected a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (SOFR) to replace LIBOR. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (which is different for LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question, although some transactions using SOFR have been completed in 2019, and the future of LIBOR remains uncertain at this time. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans, and to a lesser extent, securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including the rates we pay on our subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers or our existing borrowings, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or\nlitigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and we use estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be imprecise and result in significant changes in valuation.\nA portion of our assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, including investment securities available for sale, mortgage servicing rights related to single family loans and single family loans held for sale. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or internal valuation models that use observable market data inputs to estimate their fair value. In certain cases, observable market prices and data may not be readily available, or their availability may be diminished due to market conditions. We use financial models to value certain of these assets. These models are complex and use asset-specific collateral data and market inputs for interest rates. Although we have processes and procedures in place governing internal valuation models and their testing and calibration, such assumptions are complex because we must make judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions could result in significant changes in valuation, which in turn could affect earnings or result in significant changes in the dollar amount of assets reported on the balance sheet. From time to time, we may choose to retire or replace existing financial models and reassess assumptions underlying the models, which may impact our valuation estimates.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our future growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments, including Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposit and issuance of equity or debt securities. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources and could make our existing funds more volatile. Our financial flexibility may be materially constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. When interest rates change, the cost of our funding may change at a different rate than our interest income, which may have a negative impact on our net interest income and, in turn, our financial results. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In that case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Further, the volatility inherent in some of these funding sources, particularly brokered deposits, may increase our exposure to liquidity risk.\nOur management of capital could adversely affect profitability measures and the market price of our common stock and could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock.\nSince our IPO in 2012, we have maintained our capital ratios at a level that is higher than regulatory minimums. We may choose to have lower capital ratios in the future in order to take advantage of growth opportunities, including acquisition and organic loan growth, to return additional capital to our shareholders or in order to take advantage of a favorable investment opportunity. On the other hand, we may again in the future elect to raise capital through a sale of our debt or equity securities in order to have additional resources to pursue our growth, including by acquisition, fund our business needs and meet our commitments, or as a response to changes in economic conditions that make capital raising a prudent choice. In the event the quality of our assets or our economic position were to deteriorate significantly, as a result of market forces or otherwise, we may also need to raise additional capital in order to remain compliant with capital standards.\nWe may not be able to raise such additional capital at the time when we need it, or on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at the time, which are outside our control, and in part on our financial performance. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, especially if it is in response to changing market conditions, we may need to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital, which would create competition for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, any capital raising alternatives could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in government-sponsored enterprises and their ability to insure or to buy our loans in the secondary market may result in significant changes in our ability to recognize income on sale of our loans to third parties.\nWe originate a substantial portion of our single family mortgage loans for sale to government-sponsored enterprises (\"GSE\") such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Changes in the types of loans purchased by these GSEs or the program requirements for those entities could adversely impact our ability to sell certain of the loans we originate for sale. For example, as a result of Section 309 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted into law in May 2018, a few of our VA-qualified loans we had originated for sale to Ginnie Mae were deemed to be ineligible for sale to Ginnie Mae under the revised terms of that entity\u2019s program and we were required to find a different way to sell these loans. Such changes are difficult to predict and can have a negative impact on our cash flow and results of operations.\nThe integration of recent and future acquisitions could consume significant resources and may not be successful.\nWe completed four whole-bank acquisitions and acquired nine stand-alone branches between September 2013 and December 31, 2019, all of which required substantial resources and costs related to the acquisition and integration process. There are certain risks related to the integration of operations of acquired banks and branches, which we may continue to encounter if we acquire other banks or branches in the future, including risks related to the investigation and consideration of the potential acquisition and the costs of undertaking such a transaction, as well as integrating acquired businesses into the Company, including risks that arise after the transaction is completed. Difficulties in pursuing or integrating any new acquisitions, and potential discoveries of additional losses or undisclosed liabilities with respect to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies, may increase our costs and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, even if we successfully address these factors and are successful in closing acquisitions and integrating our systems with the acquired systems, we may nonetheless experience customer losses, or we may fail to grow the acquired businesses as we intend or to operate the acquired businesses at a level that would avoid losses or justify our investments in those companies.\nIf we breach any of the representations or warranties we make to a purchaser or securitizer of our loans or MSRs, we may be liable to the purchaser or securitizer for certain costs and damages.\nWhen we sell or securitize loans, we are required to make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser about the loans and the manner in which they were originated. Our agreements require us to repurchase loans if we have breached any of these representations or warranties, in which case we may be required to repurchase such loan and record a loss upon repurchase and/or bear any subsequent loss on the loan. We may not have any remedies available to us against a third party for such losses, or the remedies available to us may not be as broad as the remedies available to the purchaser of the loan against us. In addition, if there are remedies against a third party available to us, we face further risk that such third party may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available to us. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces remedies against us, we may not be able to recover our losses from a third party and may be required to bear the full amount of the related loss.\nIn 2019, we sold a substantial portion of our MSRs related to our large scale mortgage business, which may increase our exposure to these risks in the short term due to the volume of MSR sales outside of our historical ordinary course of business.\nIf we experience increased repurchase and indemnity demands on loans or MSRs that we have sold or that we sell from our portfolios in the future, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we breach any representations or warranties or fail to follow guidelines when originating a FHA/HUD-insured loan or a VA-guaranteed loan, we may lose the insurance or guarantee on the loan and suffer losses, pay penalties, and/or be subjected to litigation from the federal government.\nWe originate and purchase, sell and thereafter service single family loans, some of which are insured by FHA/HUD or guaranteed by the VA. We certify to the FHA/HUD and the VA that the loans meet their requirements and guidelines. The FHA/HUD and VA audit loans that are insured or guaranteed under their programs, including audits of our processes and procedures as well as individual loan documentation. Violations of guidelines can result in monetary penalties or require us to provide indemnifications against loss or loans declared ineligible for their programs. In the past, monetary penalties and losses from indemnifications have not created material losses to the Bank. FHA/HUD perform regular audits, and HUD's Inspector General is active in enforcing FHA regulations with respect to individual loans, including partnering with the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") to bring lawsuits against lenders for systemic violations. The penalties resulting from such lawsuits can be severe, since systemic violations can be applied to groups of loans and penalties may be subject to treble damages. The DOJ has used the Federal False Claims Act and other federal laws and regulations in prosecuting these lawsuits. Because of our significant origination of FHA/HUD insured and VA guaranteed loans, if the DOJ were to find potential violations by the Bank, we could\nbe subject to material monetary penalties and/or losses, and may even be subject to lawsuits alleging systemic violations which could result in treble damages.\nChanges in fee structures by third party loan purchasers may decrease our loan production volume and the margin we can recognize on loans and may adversely impact our results of operations.\nChanges in the fee structures by third party loan purchasers may increase our costs of doing business and, in turn, increase the cost of loans to our customers and the cost of selling loans to third party loan purchasers. Increases in those costs could in turn decrease our margin and negatively impact our profitability. Were any of our third party loan purchasers to make such changes in the future, it may have a negative impact on our ability to originate loans to be sold because of the increased costs of such loans and may decrease our profitability with respect to loans held for sale. In addition, any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary market or the underwriting criteria of these third party loan purchasers could negatively impact our results of business, operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur additional costs in placing loans if our third party purchasers discontinue doing business with us for any reason.\nWe rely on third party purchasers with whom we place loans as a source of funding for the loans we make to customers. Occasionally, third party loan purchasers may go out of business, elect to exit the market or choose to cease doing business with us for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the increased burdens on purchasers related to compliance, adverse market conditions or other pressures on the industry. In the event that one or more third party purchasers goes out of business, exits the market or otherwise ceases to do business with us at a time when we have loans that have been placed with such purchaser but not yet sold, we may incur additional costs to sell those loans to other purchasers or may have to retain such loans, which could negatively impact our results of operations and our capital position.\nOur real estate lending may expose us to environmental liabilities.\nIn the course of our business, it is necessary to foreclose and take title to real estate, including commercial real estate which could subject us to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. Hazardous substances or waste, contaminants, pollutants or sources thereof may be discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. We could be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at such properties. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial and could substantially exceed the value of the real property. In addition, if we were to be an owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. We may be unable to recover costs from any third party. These occurrences may materially reduce the value of the affected property, and we may find it difficult or impossible to use or sell the property prior to or following any environmental remediation. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMarket-Related Risks\nFluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our assets and reduce our net interest income and noninterest income, thereby adversely affecting our earnings and profitability.\nInterest rates may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including general and economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. For example, unexpected increases in interest rates can result in a higher percentage of rate lock customers closing loans, which would in turn increase our costs relative to income. On the other hand, decreases in interest rates may increase loan prepayment speeds, resulting in an overall decrease in the yield of our loan portfolio, and may have a negative impact on our net interest margins and results of operations. Changes in interest rates over the past year have impacted our business. Rising interest rates in 2018 reduced our mortgage revenues by reducing the market for refinancing, thereby negatively impacting demand for certain of our residential loan products and the revenue realized on the sale of loans and our noninterest income and, to a lesser extent, our net interest income. Subsequently, decreasing interest rates in 2019 negatively impacted our net interest margin while also reducing the overall yield of our loans held for investment portfolio because existing loans bearing higher interest rates were prepaid at a faster rate and replaced in the portfolio with lower interest rate loans.\nMarket volatility in interest rates also can be difficult to predict, as unexpected interest rate changes may result in a sudden impact while anticipated changes in interest rates generally impact the mortgage rate market prior to the actual rate change.\nOur earnings are also dependent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings and may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, changes to market interest rates may impact the level of loans, deposits and investments and the credit quality of existing loans.\nAsymmetrical changes in interest rates, for example a greater increase in short term rates than in long term rates, could adversely impact our net interest income because our liabilities, including advances from the FHLB and interest payable on our deposits, tend to be more sensitive to short term rates while our assets tend to be more sensitive to long term rates. In addition, it may take longer for our assets to reprice to adjust to a new rate environment because fixed rate loans do not fluctuate with interest rate changes and adjustable rate loans often have a specified period of reset. As a result, a flattening or an inversion of the yield curve, such as occurred in the third quarter of 2019, is likely to have a negative impact on our net interest income.\nOur securities portfolio also includes securities that are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises and other securities that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The unrealized gains or losses in our available-for-sale portfolio are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized upon sale. Interest rate fluctuations may impact the value of these securities and as a result, shareholders' equity, and may cause material fluctuations from quarter to quarter. Failure to hold our securities until maturity or until market conditions are favorable for a sale could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive.\nWe face pricing competition for loans and deposits. We also face competition with respect to customer convenience, product lines, accessibility of service and service capabilities. Our most direct competition comes from other banks, credit unions, mortgage companies and savings institutions but more recently has also come from financial technology (or \"fintech\") companies that rely heavily on technology to provide financial services and often target a younger customer demographic. The significant competition in attracting and retaining deposits and making loans as well as in providing other financial services throughout our market area may impact future earnings and growth. Our success depends, in part, on the ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards and provide consistent customer service while keeping costs in line. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices, which can reduce net interest income and non-interest income from fee-based products and services. New technology-driven products and services are often introduced and adopted, including innovative ways that customers can make payments, access products and manage accounts. We could be required to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. We could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to cost increases if we do not effectively develop and implement new technology. In addition, advances in technology such as telephone, text and on-line banking, e-commerce and self-service automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences to access our products and services through digital channels, could decrease the value of our branch network and other assets. As a result of these competitive pressures, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have significantly decreased our home loan mortgage origination capacity with our new business model which may limit our ability to increase our volume significantly in the event of a significant improvement in the mortgage market.\nDue to increases in mortgage rates after many years of record low rates and a nationwide contraction in the number of homes available for sale, which is especially acute in our primary markets, we experienced a significant reduction in the overall number of mortgage products being purchased in the past two to three years as compared to prior periods. In response to those market conditions, in 2019 we sold or divested substantially all of the assets related to our stand alone home loan center-based mortgage origination business, including a significant portion of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio originated through those channels. We facilitated the transfer of a significant number of our related employees to the purchaser of those assets and terminated a number of other related positions. We also sold our interest in WMS Series LLC, an affiliated entity owned by us and Windermere Real Estate which originated single family loans that were generally immediately sold to HomeStreet pursuant to a correspondent purchase arrangement. Our branch based mortgage business which commenced operations on April 1, 2019 is significantly smaller than our legacy HLC based mortgage origination business. If the mortgage market were to significantly improve, we would not have the capacity to originate mortgages to the volume levels we have had in recent years, which would limit our ability to capitalize on that market.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may face additional and potentially substantial fluctuations in the future. Among the factors that may impact our stock price are the following:\n\u2022\nVariances in our operating results;\n\u2022\nDisparity between our operating results and the operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\nChanges in analyst's estimates of our earnings results and future performance, or variances between our actual performance and that forecast by analysts;\n\u2022\nNews releases or other announcements of material events relating to the Company, including but not limited to mergers, acquisitions, expansion plans, restructuring activities or other strategic developments;\n\u2022\nStatements made by activist investors criticizing our strategy, our management team or our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nFuture securities offerings by us of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nRepurchase activity by us under our stock repurchase program;\n\u2022\nAddition or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nMarket-wide events that may be seen by the market as impacting the Company;\n\u2022\nThe presence or absence of short-selling of our common stock;\n\u2022\nGeneral financial conditions of the country or the regions in which we operate;\n\u2022\nTrends in real estate in our primary markets;\n\u2022\nTrends relating to the economic markets generally; or\n\u2022\nChanges in laws and regulations affecting financial institutions.\nThe stock markets in general experience substantial price and trading fluctuations. Such changes may create volatility in the market as a whole or in the stock prices of securities related to particular industries or companies that are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance of the Company. Such volatility may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nA decline in certain economic conditions continue to pose significant challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the loans and other products and services we sell. A substantial amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest income and noninterest income that we earn from our commercial lending and mortgage banking businesses. Our operations have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. A prolonged period of slow growth or a pronounced decline in the U.S. economy, or any deterioration in general economic conditions and/or the financial markets resulting from these factors, or any other events or factors that may signal a return to a recessionary economic environment, could dampen consumer confidence, adversely impact the models we use to assess creditworthiness, and materially adversely affect our financial results and condition. A downturn in the economy and an increase in unemployment, which also would likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, may lead to a drop in demand for our credit products, including our mortgages, which will reduce our net interest income and noninterest income and our earnings. Significant and unexpected market developments may also make it more challenging for us to accurately forecast our expected financial results.\nA change in federal monetary policy could adversely impact our revenues from lending activities.\nThe Federal Reserve Board is responsible for regulating the supply of money in the United States, and as a result, its monetary policies strongly influence our costs of funds for lending and investing, as well as the rate of return we are able to earn on those loans and investments, both of which impact our net interest income and net interest margin. Changes in interest rates may increase our cost of capital or decrease the income we receive from interest bearing assets. Asymmetrical changes in short term and long-term interest rates may result in a more rapid increase in the costs related to interest-bearing liabilities such as FHLB advances and interest-bearing deposit accounts without a correlated increase in the income from interest-bearing assets which are typically more sensitive to long-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve Board's interest rate policies can also materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, including debt securities, MSRs and derivative instruments used to hedge against changes in the value of our MSRs. These monetary policies can also negatively impact our borrowers, which in turn may increase the risk that they will be unable to pay their loans according to the terms or be unable to pay their loans at all. We have no control over the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies and cannot predict when changes are expected or what the magnitude of such changes may be.\nA portion of our revenue is derived from residential mortgage lending which is a market sector that experiences significant volatility.\nHistorically, a substantial portion of our consolidated net revenues (net interest income plus noninterest income) have been derived from originating and selling residential mortgages. While we have recently significantly decreased the size of our residential mortgage business through the sale of our HLC-based mortgage business and our interest in WMS Series LLC, we expect to continue to offer mortgage lending on a smaller scale, and therefore will remain subject to the volatility of that market sector. Residential mortgage lending in general has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods due to changes in interest rates, a significant lack of housing inventory caused by an increase in demand for housing at a time of decreased supply in our principal markets, and other market forces beyond our control. Lack of housing inventory limits our ability to originate purchase mortgages because it may take longer for loan applicants to find a home to buy after being pre-approved for a loan, which results in the Company incurring costs related to the pre-approval without being able to book the revenue from an actual loan. In addition, interest rate changes may result in lower rate locks and higher closed loan volume which can negatively impact our financial results because we book revenue at the time we enter into rate lock agreements after adjusting for the estimated percentage of loans that are not expected to actually close, which we refer to as \"fallout.\" When interest rates rise, the level of fallout as a percentage of rate locks declines, which results in higher costs relative to income for that period, which may adversely impact our earnings and results of operations. In addition, an increase in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our future loan origination volume, margins, and the value of the collateral securing our outstanding loans, may increase rates of borrower default, and may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe may incur losses due to changes in prepayment rates.\nOur loan servicing rights carry interest rate risk because the total amount of servicing fees earned, as well as changes in fair-market value, fluctuate based on expected loan prepayments (affecting the expected average life of a portfolio of residential mortgage servicing rights). The rate of prepayment of loans generally may be impacted by changes in interest rates and general economic conditions while residential mortgage loans also may be influenced by pressures in the local real estate markets, among other things. During periods of declining interest rates, or increases in real estate values, many borrowers refinance their loans. Changes in prepayment rates are therefore difficult for us to predict. The loan servicing fee income (related to the loan servicing rights corresponding to a loan) decreases as loans are prepaid. Consequently, in the event of an increase in prepayment rates, we would expect the fair value of portfolios of loan servicing rights to decrease along with the amount of loan servicing income received. In the first quarter of 2019, we sold a significant portion of our mortgage servicing rights, however we continue to be exposed to such risks on a smaller scale with respect to the servicing rights we expect to retain going forward.\nRegulatory-Related Risks\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that may restrict our activities, including declaring cash dividends or capital distributions or pursuing growth initiatives and acquisition activities, and imposes financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the FDIC, the Washington Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board, and to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. The laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject evolve and change frequently, including changes that come from judicial or regulatory agency interpretations of laws and regulations outside of the legislative process that may be more difficult to anticipate. We are subject to various examinations by our regulators during the course of the year. Regulatory authorities who conduct these examinations have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the authority to restrict our operations, our growth and our acquisition activity, adversely reclassify our assets, determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, require customer restitution and impose fines or other penalties. For example, in November 2019, we entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty (the \u201cStipulation and Consent\u201d) with the FDIC based on alleged violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act raised by the FDIC during a 2016 compliance examination relating to certain marketing programs. These marketing programs, all of which we have terminated, were associated with the stand-alone home loan center mortgage origination business that we discontinued in 2019, and is accounted for in discontinued operations. We paid a civil money penalty of $1.35 million in connection with the Stipulation and Consent. We have fully resolved the matters that were at issue in the Stipulation and Consent without any additional sanctions. In addition, we have, in the past, been subject to specific regulatory orders that constrained our business and required us to take measures that investors may have deemed undesirable, and we may again in the future be subject to such orders if banking regulators were to determine that our operations require such restrictions or if they determine that remediation of operational or other legal or regulatory deficiencies is required.\nIn addition, recent political shifts in the United States may result in additional significant changes in legislation and regulations that impact us, although the possibility, nature and extent of any repeals or revisions to Dodd-Frank or any other regulations impacting financial institutions are not presently known and we cannot predict whether or not these changes will come to pass. These circumstances lead to additional uncertainty regarding our regulatory environment and the cost and requirements for compliance. We are unable to predict whether federal or state authorities, or other pertinent bodies, will enact legislations, laws, rules or regulations that will impact our business or operations. Further, an increasing amount of the regulatory authority that pertains to financial institutions is in the form of informal \"guidance\" such as handbooks, guidelines, examination manuals, field interpretations by regulators or similar provisions that will affect our business or require changes in our practices in the future even if they are not formally adopted as laws or regulations. Any such changes could adversely affect our cost of doing business and our profitability.\nChanges in regulation of our industry have the potential to create higher costs of compliance, including short-term costs to meet new compliance standards, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase our exposure to potential fines, penalties and litigation.\nPolicies and regulations enacted by CFPB may negatively impact our residential mortgage loan business and increase our compliance risk.\nOur consumer business, including our mortgage, credit card, and other consumer lending and non-lending businesses, may be adversely affected by the policies enacted or regulations adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") which under the Dodd-Frank Act has broad rulemaking authority over consumer financial products and services. For example, in January 2014 federal regulations promulgated by the CFPB took effect which impact how we originate and service residential mortgage loans. Those regulations, among other things, require mortgage lenders to assess and document a borrower's ability to repay their mortgage loan while providing borrowers the ability to challenge foreclosures and sue for damages based on allegations that the lender failed to meet the standard for determining the borrower's ability to repay their loan. While the regulations include presumptions in favor of the lender based on certain loan underwriting criteria, they have not yet been challenged widely in courts and it is uncertain how these presumptions will be construed and applied by courts in the event of litigation. The ultimate impact of these regulations on the lender's enforcement of its loan documents in the event of a loan default, and the cost and expense of doing so, is uncertain, but may be significant. In addition, the secondary market demand for loans that do not fall within the presumptively safest category of a \"qualified mortgage\" as defined by the CFPB is uncertain. Furthermore, the CFPB is considering allowing the \u201cGSE Patch\u201d provision of these regulations to expire. The \u201cGSE Patch\u201d grants a safe harbor to lenders, such as HomeStreet, to originate loans over a 43 percent debt to income (\u201cDTI\u201d) ratio and to use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards for documentation. The impact of the expiration of this provision on HomeStreet and the U.S. mortgage market is uncertain. Finally, the 2014 regulations also require changes to certain loan servicing procedures and practices, which have resulted in increased foreclosure costs and longer foreclosure timelines in the event of loan default, and failure to comply with the new servicing rules may result in additional litigation and compliance risk.\nThe CFPB was also given authority over the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, under the Dodd-Frank Act and has, in some cases, interpreted RESPA requirements differently than other agencies, regulators and judicial opinions. As a result, certain practices that have been considered standard in the industry, including relationships that have been established between mortgage lenders and others in the mortgage industry such as developers, realtors and insurance providers, are now being subjected to additional scrutiny under RESPA. Our regulators, including the FDIC, review our practices for compliance with RESPA as interpreted by the CFPB. Changes in RESPA requirements and the interpretation of RESPA requirements by our regulators may result in adverse examination findings by our regulators, leading to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, such as those associated with the recent Stipulation and Consent discussed above.\nIn addition to RESPA compliance, the Bank is also subject to the CFPB's Final Integrated Disclosure Rule, commonly known as TRID, which became effective in October 2015. Among other things, TRID requires lenders to combine the initial Good Faith Estimate and Initial Truth in Lending disclosures into a single new Loan Estimate disclosure and the HUD-1 and Final TIL disclosures into a single new Closing Disclosure. The definition of an application and timing requirements has changed, and a new Closing Disclosure waiting period has been added. These changes, along with other changes required by TRID, require significant systems modifications, process and procedure changes. Failure to comply with these new requirements may result in payment of restitution to customers for disclosure defects, regulatory penalties for disclosure and other violations under RESPA and the Truth In Lending Act (\"TILA\"), and private right of action under TILA, and may impact our ability to sell or the price we receive for certain loans.\nIn addition, the CFPB has adopted and largely implemented additional rules under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (\"HMDA\") that are intended to improve information reported about the residential mortgage market and increase disclosure about consumer access to mortgage credit. The updates to the HMDA increase the types of dwelling-secured loans that are subject to the disclosure requirements of the rule and expand the categories of information that financial institutions such as the Bank are required to report with respect to such loans and such borrowers, including potentially sensitive customer information. Most of the rule's provisions went into effect on January 1, 2018. These changes increased our compliance costs due to the need for additional resources to meet the enhanced disclosure requirements as well as informational systems to allow the Bank to properly capture and report the additional mandated information. The volume of new data that is required to be reported under the updated rules will also cause the Bank to face an increased risk of errors in the processing of such information. More importantly, because of the sensitive nature of some of the additional customer information to be included in such reports, the Bank may face a higher potential for security breaches resulting in the disclosure of sensitive customer information in the event the HMDA reporting files were obtained by an unauthorized party.\nInterpretation of federal and state legislation, case law or regulatory action may negatively impact our business.\nRegulatory and judicial interpretation of existing and future federal and state legislation, case law, judicial orders and regulations could also require us to revise our operations and change certain business practices, impose additional costs, reduce our revenue and earnings and otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, judges interpreting legislation and judicial decisions made during the recent financial crisis could allow modification of the terms of residential mortgages in bankruptcy proceedings which could hinder our ability to foreclose promptly on defaulted mortgage loans or expand assignee liability for certain violations in the mortgage loan origination process, any or all of which could adversely affect our business or result in our being held responsible for violations in the mortgage loan origination process. In addition, the exercise by regulators of revised and at times expanded powers under existing or future regulations could materially and negatively impact the profitability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans, require changes to business practices, limit our ability to pursue growth strategies or force us to discontinue certain business practices and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, penalties, enforcement actions and reputational risk.\nSuch judicial decisions or regulatory interpretations may affect the manner in which we do business and the products and services that we provide, restrict our ability to grow through acquisition, restrict our ability to compete in our current business or expand into any new business, and impose additional fees, assessments or taxes on us or increase our regulatory oversight.\nFederal, state and local consumer protection laws may restrict our ability to offer and/or increase our risk of liability with respect to certain products and services and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain practices considered \"predatory\" or \"unfair and deceptive\". These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, failing to disclose key features, limitations, or costs related to products and services, failing to provide advertised benefits, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans, imposing excessive fees for overdrafts, and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans or engage in deceptive practices, but these laws and regulations create the potential for liability with respect to our lending, servicing, loan investment, deposit taking and other financial activities. As a company that originates single family mortgage loans, we also, inherently, have a significant amount of risk of noncompliance with fair lending laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and require vigilance to ensure that policies and practices do not create disparate impact on our customers or that our employees do not engage in overt discriminatory practices. Noncompliance can result in significant regulatory actions including, but not limited to, sanctions, fines or referrals to the Department of Justice and restrictions on our ability to execute our growth and expansion plans. If we offer products and services to customers in additional states, we may become subject to additional state and local laws designed to protect consumers. The additional laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and ultimately may prevent us from making certain loans, offering certain products, and may cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans and other products and services that we do provide.\nIf our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing stockholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, analyze and control the types of risk to which we are subject. These risks include liquidity risk, credit risk, price risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, strategic risk, and reputational risk, among others. We also maintain a compliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable laws, policies and procedures. While we assess and improve these programs on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that our risk management or compliance programs, along with other related controls, will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in our business. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and we could be subject to regulatory criticism or restrictions.\nSignificant legal or regulatory actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities and reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are from time to time subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations. These claims and legal actions could include supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators, or criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities, or claims by former and current employees, including class, collective and representative actions. Such actions are a substantial management distraction and could involve large monetary claims, including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and significant defense costs. For example, since 2016 we used considerable management time and resources and incurred additional legal and other costs associated with the matters resulting in the recent Stipulation and Consent Agreement with the FDIC in November 2019, pursuant to which we recently paid a penalty of $1.35 million.\nTo mitigate the cost of some of these claims, we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. However, our insurance coverage does not cover any civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and may not cover all other claims that might be brought against us, including certain wage and hour class, collective and representative actions brought by employees or former employees. In addition, such insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or at all. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could cause significant reputational harm to us and/or could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements under Basel III.\nAs of January 1, 2015, we became subject to new rules relating to capital standards requirements, including requirements contemplated by Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which standards are commonly referred to as Basel III. Many of these rules apply to both the Company and the Bank, including increased common equity Tier 1 capital ratios, Tier 1 leverage ratios, Tier 1 risk-based ratios and total risk-based ratios. In addition, beginning in 2016, all institutions subject to Basel III, including the Company and the Bank are required to establish a \"conservation buffer\" that took full effect on January 1, 2019. This conservation buffer consists of common equity Tier 1 capital and is now required to be 2.5% above existing minimum capital ratio requirements. This means that, in order to prevent certain regulatory restrictions, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement is now 7.0%, the Tier 1 risk-based ratio requirement is 8.5% and the total risk-based capital ratio requirement is 10.5%. Any institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nAdditional prompt corrective action rules implemented in 2015 also apply to the Bank, including higher and new ratio requirements for the Bank to be considered \"well-capitalized.\" The new rules also modify the manner for determining when certain capital elements are included in the ratio calculations, including but not limited to, requiring certain deductions related to MSRs and deferred tax assets. For more on these regulatory requirements and how they apply to the Company and the Bank, see \"Business - Regulation and Supervision of HomeStreet Bank - Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements - Capital Requirements\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. In addition, if we need to raise additional equity capital in order to meet these more stringent requirements, our shareholders may be diluted.\nHomeStreet, Inc. primarily relies on dividends from the Bank, which may be limited by applicable laws and regulations.\nHomeStreet, Inc. is a separate legal entity from the Bank, and although we may receive some dividends from HomeStreet Capital Corporation, the primary source of our funds from which we service our debt, pay any dividends that we may declare to our shareholders and otherwise satisfy our obligations is dividends from the Bank. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations, capital rules regarding requirements to maintain a \"well capitalized\" ratio at the bank, as well as by our policy of retaining a significant portion of our earnings to support the Bank's operations. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Management\" as well as \"Regulation and Supervision of HomeStreet Bank - Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If the Bank cannot pay dividends to us, we may be limited in our ability to service our debt, fund the Company's operations and acquisition plans and pay dividends to the Company's shareholders. In the first quarter of 2020, the Board of Directors adopted a policy to pay quarterly dividends to holders of our common stock, however, the declaration of such dividends in any quarter as well as the amount of any quarterly dividend remains subject to board approval, cash flow limitations, capital requirements, capital and strategic needs and other factors.\nRisks Related to Information Systems and Security\nA failure in or breach of our security systems or infrastructure, including breaches resulting from cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. Those parties also may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks, either managed directly by us or through our data processing vendors. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal computers, smartphones, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, we rely heavily on our third party vendors, technologies, systems, networks and our customers' devices all of which may become the target of cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, unauthorized access, hackers or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, theft or destruction of our confidential, proprietary and other information or that of our customers, or disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties.\nTo date we are not aware of any material losses that we have incurred relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks, breaches and losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our plans to continue to evolve our Internet banking and mobile banking channel, our expanding operations and the outsourcing of a significant portion of our business operations. As a result, the continued development and enhancement of our information security controls, processes and practices designed to protect customer information, our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for our management. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to insure, modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate important information security vulnerabilities or exposures; however, our measures may be insufficient to prevent all physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service and other cyber-attacks or security breaches.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, uninsured financial losses, the inability of our customers to transact business with us, employee productivity losses, technology replacement costs, incident response costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, additional regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage, litigation, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe rely on third party vendors and other service providers for certain critical business activities, which creates additional operational and information security risks for us.\nThird parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries, agents or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from interruptions or failures of their own systems, cybersecurity or ransomware attacks, capacity constraints or failures of their own internal controls. Specifically, we receive core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems and deposit and other processing services from third-party service providers. In late February 2018, one of our vendors provided notice to us that their independent auditors had determined their internal controls to be inadequate. While we do not believe this particular failure of internal controls would have an impact on us due to the strength of our own internal controls, future failures of internal controls of a vendor could have a significant impact on our operations if we do not have controls to cover those issues. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2019, we were advised by a third party providing services with access to certain of our systems that they had been subjected to a cybersecurity incident. We took measures to limit our vulnerability to such an attack and reviewed our own systems to determine that there was no apparent impact to our systems. However, the interruption caused by the breach in this third party's systems has limited their ability to provide us with contracted services which had the potential to increase our costs of doing business. To date, none of our third party vendors or service providers has notified us of any security breach in their systems that has breached the integrity of our confidential customer data. However, such third parties may also be targets of cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, unauthorized access, hackers, ransomware attacks or information security breaches that could compromise the confidential or proprietary information of HomeStreet and our customers.\nIn addition, if any third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted and our operating expenses may materially increase. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSome of our primary third party service providers are subject to examination by banking regulators and may be subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny due to regulatory findings during examinations of such service providers conducted by federal regulators. While we subject such vendors to higher scrutiny and monitor any corrective measures that the vendors are taking or would undertake, we cannot fully anticipate and mitigate all risks that could result from a breach or other operational failure of a vendor's system.\nOthers provide technology that we use in our own regulatory compliance, including our mortgage loan origination technology. If those providers fail to update their systems or services in a timely manner to reflect new or changing regulations, or if our personnel operate these systems in a non-compliant manner, our ability to meet regulatory requirements may be impacted and may expose us to heightened regulatory scrutiny and the potential for monetary penalties.\nIn addition, in order to safeguard our online financial transactions, we must provide secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our Internet banking system relies on third party encryption and authentication technologies necessary to provide secure transmission of confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptology or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms our third-party service providers use to protect customer data. If any such compromise of security were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to protect our customers' confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations that, among other things restrict the use and dissemination of, and access to, certain information that we produce, store or maintain in the course of our business. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and customers. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information, and in some instances may impose indemnity obligations on us relating to unlawful or unauthorized disclosure of any such information.\nRecently passed legislation in the European Union (the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR) and in California (the California Privacy Act) may increase the burden and cost of compliance specifically in the realm of consumer data privacy. We are still evaluating the potential impact of these new regulations on our business and do not yet know exactly what the impact may be but anticipate that there will be at least some added cost and burden as a result of these measures. In addition, other federal, state or local governments may try to implement similar legislation, which could result in different privacy standards for different geographical regions, which could require significantly more resources for compliance.\nIf we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and contractual obligations that require us to protect confidential information, or if we experience a security breach or network compromise, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, penalties or fines, increased compliance costs, remedial costs such as providing credit monitoring or other services to affected customers, litigation and damage to our reputation, which in turn could result in decreased revenues and loss of customers, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe network and computer systems on which we depend could fail for reasons not related to security breaches.\nOur computer systems could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems other than a cyber-attack or other security breach. Because we conduct a part of our business over the Internet and outsource several critical functions to third parties, operations will depend on our ability, as well as the ability of third-party service providers, to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical break-ins or similar catastrophic events. Any damage or failure that causes interruptions in operations may compromise our ability to perform critical functions in a timely manner (or may give rise to perceptions of such compromise) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as our reputation and customer or vendor relationships.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many national vendors provide turn-key services to community banks, such as Internet banking and remote deposit capture that allow smaller banks to compete with institutions that have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able, however, to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nAnti-Takeover Risk\nSome provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of Washington law may deter takeover attempts, which may limit the opportunity of our shareholders to sell their shares at a favorable price.\nSome provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our shareholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests, or to effect changes in control. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nA phased-out classified Board of Directors so that until 2022, only a portion of our board of directors will be elected each year;\n\u2022\nElimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nProcedures for advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals;\n\u2022\nThe ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022\nThe ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval upon the terms and conditions and with the rights, privileges and preferences as the Board of Directors may determine.\nIn addition, as a Washington corporation, we are subject to Washington law which imposes restrictions on business combinations and similar transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control. These restrictions may limit a shareholder's ability to benefit from a change-in-control transaction that might otherwise result in a premium unless such a transaction is favored by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 13278, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HMST"}
