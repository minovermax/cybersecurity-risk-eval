You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as each of these risks could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial conditions. If any of the possible adverse events described below actually occurs, we may be unable to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Please see \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe need to raise substantial additional funding to continue the development of vecabrutinib, SNS-510, and our other programs.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital to:\n\u2022\nfund additional clinical trials of vecabrutinib prior to any regulatory filing for approval;\n\u2022\nfund preclinical and clinical development of SNS-510;\n\u2022\nexpand our development activities;\n\u2022\nimplement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nbuild or access commercialization and additional manufacturing capabilities and supplies.\nOur future funding requirements and sources will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the:\n\u2022\nrate of progress and cost of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nneed for additional or expanded clinical trials;\n\u2022\ntiming, economic and other terms of any licensing, collaboration or other similar arrangement into which we may enter;\n\u2022\ncosts and timing of seeking and obtaining EMA, FDA or other regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nextent of our other development activities, including our other clinical programs and in-license agreements;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with building or accessing commercialization and additional manufacturing capabilities and supplies;\n\u2022\ncosts of acquiring or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies, if any;\n\u2022\ncosts of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\neffect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\ncosts of supporting our arrangements with Biogen, Takeda or any potential future licensees or partners.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of licensing, collaboration or product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through equity issuances, debt arrangements, one or more possible licenses, collaborations or other similar arrangements with respect to development and/or commercialization rights to vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or our other development programs, or a combination of the above. Any issuance of convertible debt securities, preferred stock or common stock may be at a discount from the then-current trading price of our common stock. If we issue additional common or preferred stock or securities convertible into common or preferred stock, our stockholders will experience additional dilution, which may be significant. Further, we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise substantial additional funding on acceptable terms, or at all, we will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of our vecabrutinib, SNS-510 or other development programs, potentially including any additional clinical trials or subsequent regulatory filings in Europe and the United States and/or limit or cease our operations.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may not ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 1998. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $35.5 million, $38.0 million and $36.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $632.9 million. We do not currently have any products that have been approved for marketing, and we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to incur substantial development and general and administrative expenses related to our operations. Following the decision to withdraw the European Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for vosaroxin as a treatment for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients aged 60 years or older, we have prioritized development funding on kinase inhibitors with a focus on vecabrutinib. We have a limited number of products that are still in the early stages of approval and will require significant additional investment. Our losses, among other things, have caused and will continue to cause our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital to decrease.\nTo date, we have derived substantially all of our revenue from license and collaboration agreements. We currently have two agreements; the Biogen 2nd ARCA and the Amended Takeda Agreement, which each include certain pre-commercialization event-based and royalty payments. We cannot predict if our collaborators will continue development or whether we will receive any such payments under these agreements in the foreseeable future, or at all.\nWe are unable to predict when we will generate revenue from the sale of products, if at all. In the absence of additional sources of capital or partnering opportunity, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, the development of vecabrutinib or future product candidates may be reduced in scope, delayed or terminated. If our product candidates or those of our collaborators fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if our future products do not achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) effective December 31, 2016, which requires us to make certain disclosures if we conclude that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of the issuance of these financial statements.\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception, and as of December 31, 2017, had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $31.8 million and an accumulated deficit of $632.9 million. We expect our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $31.8 million are not sufficient to support our operations for a period of twelve months from the date the financial statements are issued. We will require additional financing to fund working capital, repay debt and pay our obligations as they come due. Additional financing might include one or more offerings and one or more of a combination of equity securities, debt arrangements or partnership or licensing collaborations. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of the issuance of these financial statements. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise additional financing in the near term, we will be required to significantly reduce or cease operations. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe development of vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or other product candidates could be halted or significantly delayed for various reasons; our clinical trials for vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or other product candidates may not lead to regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates are vulnerable to the risks of failure inherent in the drug development process. Failure can occur at any stage of the development process, and successful preclinical studies and early clinical trials do not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials.\nOur product candidates may experience toxicities that lead to a maximum tolerated dose that is not effective. If this were the case for vecabrutinib, for example, such a result would delay or prevent further development, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects.\nWe do not know whether our current or any future clinical trials with vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or any of our product candidates will be completed on schedule, or at all, or whether our ongoing or planned clinical trials will begin or progress on the time schedule we anticipate. The commencement and completion of future clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u2022\ndelays or failures to raise additional funding;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining approval from independent institutional review boards or ECs to conduct a clinical trial at prospective sites; or\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in reaching acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites.\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in obtaining sufficient clinical materials, including any of our product and any drugs to be tested in combination with our products;\n\u2022\nfailure of third parties such as Contract Research Organizations and medical institutions to perform their contractual duties and obligations;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u2022\nfailure of patients to complete the clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in reaching the number of events pre-specified in the trial design;\n\u2022\nthe need to expand the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\nlack of efficacy during clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of patients or clinical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols; and\n\u2022\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment.\nAdditionally, our clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time by the FDA, other regulatory authorities, or ourselves for reasons such as change in protocol. Any failure to complete or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates could harm our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nWe rely on a limited number of third parties to supply us with our API and FDP. If we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials, the development and potential commercialization of vecabrutinib, SNS-510 and future products, if any, could be halted or significantly delayed.\nWe currently rely on contract manufacturers for all API and FDP. Additional third-party contract manufacturing organizations are relied on to manufacture key starting materials and intermediates required in the manufacture of API. We have limited manufacturing experience, and we have not yet scaled-up to commercial scale. The cost to manufacture at commercial scale may materially exceed the cost of clinical-stage manufacturing.\nIf our third-party API or FDP manufacturers are unable or unwilling to produce the API or FDP we require, we would need to establish arrangements with one or more alternative suppliers. However, establishing a relationship with an alternative supplier would likely delay our ability to produce API or FDP. Our ability to replace an existing manufacturer would also be difficult and time consuming because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA, EMA or other corresponding state agencies must approve any replacement manufacturer before it can be an approved commercial supplier. Such approval would require new testing, stability programs and compliance inspections. It may be difficult or impossible for us to identify and engage a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all. We expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all our API and FDP needs for the foreseeable future.\nOur products require precise, high quality manufacturing. In addition to process impurities, the failure of our contract manufacturers to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with cGMP regulations could result in other manufacturing errors leading to patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery. Although contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, EMA or other corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards, any such performance failures on the part of a contract manufacturer could result in the delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for vosaroxin, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. This would deprive us of potential product revenue and result in additional losses.\nThe stability of API and FDP is also a key risk, as we must demonstrate that products continue to meet product specifications over time. There can be no assurances that future lots will meet stability requirements and if they do not, development and commercialization of our products may be delayed.\nThe failure to enroll patients for clinical trials may cause delays in developing vecabrutinib or other product candidates.\nWe may encounter delays if we are unable to enroll enough patients to complete clinical trials of vecabrutinib or other product candidates. Patient enrollment depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the number and nature of competing treatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing drugs for the same indication, and the eligibility criteria for the trial. In a Phase 1 dose escalation 3+3 design, slots are assigned to sites to avoid over-enrolling. After allocating a slot to a patient, patients may be unable to commence the study due to progressive disease or may withdraw consent. Patients participating in our trials may come off study due to progressive disease, or may elect to leave our trials to switch to alternative treatments that are available to them, either commercially or on an expanded access basis, or in other clinical trials. Competing treatments for vecabrutinib include other BTK inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, and other drug classes.\nThe results of preclinical studies and clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies.\nPrior to receiving approval to commercialize vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or future product candidates in Europe, the United States or in other territories, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. The results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe preclinical or clinical data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities. Results in preclinical studies may not be predictive of results in human clinical trials and early stage human clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later, larger trials.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or fail to meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, vecabrutinib, vosaroxin or other product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our planned and existing clinical trials for vecabrutinib, vosaroxin, and other product candidates. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, do not meet expected deadlines or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nWe may expand our development capabilities in the future, and any difficulties hiring or retaining key personnel or managing this growth could disrupt our operations.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our development staff. We may expand our research and development capabilities in the future by increasing expenditures in these areas, hiring additional employees and potentially expanding the scope of our current operations. Future growth will require us to continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems and continue to retain, recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. The competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. We are highly dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and specialized personnel required for clinical development. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage any expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain key personnel or manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to implement our business plan.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, litigation will be costly and time consuming and could prevent us from developing or commercializing vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or other product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends on not infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties and not breaching any collaboration or other agreements we have entered into with regard to our technologies and product candidates. If a third party asserts that we are using technology claimed in issued and unexpired patents, or other proprietary rights, owned or controlled by the third party, we may need to obtain a license, enter into litigation to challenge the validity or enforceability of the patents or other rights or incur the risk of litigation in the event that a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or have misappropriated other rights.\nIf a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of challenges that could seriously harm our competitive position, including:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time consuming to litigate, whether or not the claims have merit, and which could delay the regulatory approval process and divert management\u2019s attention from our business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court determines that vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or any future product candidates infringe a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\na court order prohibiting us from selling or licensing vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or any future product candidates unless a third party licenses relevant patent or other proprietary rights to us, which it is not required to do; and\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights.\nIf our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than vecabrutinib, vosaroxin or other product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching, developing and marketing products designed to address the treatment of cancer, including B-cell malignancies and AML. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in the clinical testing of, obtaining regulatory approvals for, and marketing drugs.\nWe expect competition during the development and commercialization of all of our products in all of their potential future indications. Competition is likely to increase as additional products are developed and approved in various patient populations. If our competitors market products that are more effective, safer, and/or less expensive than our future products, if any, or that reach the market sooner we may not achieve commercial success or substantial market penetration. In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid change. Products developed by our competitors may render any of our future product candidates obsolete.\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or future product candidates, if any.\nWe use patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, and marketing exclusivity administered by regulatory authorities to protect our products from generic copies of our products. Our ability to build and maintain our proprietary position for any future drug candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing granted claims. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which some important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of patent claims has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Even if patents are issued, they may not be sufficient to protect vecabrutinib, SNS-510, vosaroxin or future drug candidates. The patents we own or license and those that may be issued in the future may be opposed, challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages.\nWe apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates, as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion, or at all. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad, valid, or enforceable to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. In addition, we generally do not exclusively control the patent prosecution of subject matter that we license to or from others. Accordingly, in such cases we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we would over our own. Moreover, the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. As a result, the scope, validity and enforceability of patents can vary from country to country, and can change depending on changes in national and international law, and as such, cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, we do not know whether:\n\u2022\nwe, our licensors or our collaboration partners were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe, our licensors or our collaboration partners were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers will independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nany of our, our licensors\u2019 or our collaboration partners\u2019 pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nany of our, our licensors\u2019 or our collaboration partners\u2019 patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u2022\nbecause of differences in patent laws of countries, any patent granted in one country or region will be granted in another, or, if so, have the same or a different scope;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us, our licensors or our collaboration partners will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u2022\nany patents or other proprietary rights of third parties will have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may need to commence or defend litigation to enforce or to determine the scope and validity of any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights. Litigation would result in substantial costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome in litigation affecting proprietary rights we own or have licensed could present significant risk of competition for vosaroxin or future drug candidates that we market or seek to develop. Any adverse outcome in litigation affecting third party proprietary rights could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and could require us to seek licenses of the disputed rights from third parties or to cease using the technology if such licenses are unavailable.\nThere can be no assurance that the trademarks or service marks we use or register will protect our company name or any products or technologies that we develop and commercialize, that our trademarks, service marks, or trademark registrations will be enforceable against third parties, or that our trademarks and service marks will not interfere with or infringe trademark rights of third parties. We may need to commence litigation to enforce our trademarks and service marks or to determine the scope and validity of our or a third party\u2019s trademark rights. Litigation would result in substantial costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to seek licenses of the disputed rights from third parties or to cease using the trademarks or service marks if such licenses are unavailable.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain and enforce. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our or our collaboration partners\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors, or those of our licensors or collaborators, may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, foreign courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. If our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secret protection against them and our business could be harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that the confidentiality and other agreements we put in place with employees, consultants, and partners will provide meaningful protection, that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have an adequate remedy for any such breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by a third party.\nWe do not know whether patent term extensions and data exclusivity periods will be available in the future for any or all of the patent rights we own or have licensed. While it is possible that patent term restoration and/or supplemental patent certificates would be available for some of the patents we own or control through licenses, we cannot guarantee that such additional protection will be obtained, and the expiration dates described here do not include such term restoration. However, patent expiration dates described here for U.S. patents may reflect patent term adjustments by the United States patent and Trademark Office or terminal disclaimers over related patents or patent applications. Our obligation to pay royalties to licensors may extend beyond the patent expiration, which would further erode the profitability of our products.\nWe may not succeed in finding a third party to license and complete development of vosaroxin, which may result in completely discontinuing development and returning rights to our licensor, Sumitomo Dainippon.\nWe are actively seeking a partner to license vosaroxin for the purpose of completing development and commercializing the product in the EU, the US, and in other countries. While we seek a partner, we are supporting a small number of investigator-initiated trials with vosaroxin. There is no certainty that we will find a commercial or financial partner to fund and undertake development, and failure to find such a partner will result in the complete discontinuation of vosaroxin development. In this case, the core IP will revert to Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co.,Ltd. and there will be no possibility of any future upside from the product. We may also incur costs to wind down all of our activities related to this product.\nEven if we do secure a partner for vosaroxin, there is no guarantee the transaction will result in significant revenue or other upside for Sunesis. Following the purchase of the revenue participation right by RPI, we are required to pay RPI a specified percentage of any net sales of vosaroxin. If we fail to make timely payments due to RPI under the Royalty Agreement, RPI may require us to repurchase the revenue participation right. As collateral for these payments, we granted RPI a security interest in certain of our assets, including our intellectual property related to vosaroxin. Upon marketing approval of vosaroxin, Western Alliance, the Collateral Agent ( the \u201cCollateral Agent\u201d) of our loan and security agreement (\u201cthe Loan Agreement\u201d), with Bridge Bank, a division\nof Western Alliance Bank (Western Bank\u201d) and Solar Capital Ltd (\u201cSolar Capital\u201d, and collectively with Western Bank, \u201cthe Lenders\u201d), for the benefit of the Lenders under our Loan Agreement, will also have a perfected security interest in our intellectual property rights relating to vosaroxin. We will not realize any gain from a vosaroxin licensing agreement until all of our obligations are met.\nAny future workforce and expense reductions may have an adverse impact on our internal programs, our ability to hire and retain key personnel and may be distracting to management.\nWe have, in the past, implemented a number of workforce reductions. Depending on our need for additional funding and expense control, we may be required to implement further workforce and expense reductions in the future. Further workforce and expense reductions could result in reduced progress on our internal programs. In addition, employees, whether or not directly affected by a reduction, may seek future employment with our business partners or competitors. Although our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time of hire, the confidential nature of certain proprietary information may not be maintained in the course of any such future employment. Further, we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We may have difficulty retaining and attracting such personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce and expense reductions. In addition, the implementation of expense reduction programs may result in the diversion of efforts of our executive management team and other key employees, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees\u2019 former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nA loss of key personnel or the work product of current or former personnel could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize vecabrutinib, SNS-510, vosaroxin, and future product candidates, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may lose key employees or have difficulty hiring employees to fill key roles.\nA loss of key personnel or difficulty in hiring employees to fill key roles could slow or prevent our ability to develop and commercialize our products. For example, we currently have an ongoing search for a Chief Executive Officer. If we have difficulty hiring a Chief Executive Officer it may adversely impact our future prospects.\nWe depend on various consultants and advisors for the success and continuation of our development efforts.\nWe work extensively with various consultants and advisors, who provide advice and/or services in various business and development functions, including clinical development, operations and strategy, regulatory matters, biostatistics, legal and finance. The potential success of our drug development programs depends, in part, on continued collaborations with certain of these consultants and advisors. Our consultants and advisors are not our employees and may have commitments and obligations to other entities that may limit their availability to us. We do not know if we will be able to maintain such relationships or that such consultants and advisors will not enter into other arrangements with competitors, any of which could have a detrimental impact on our development objectives and our business.\nIf conflicts of interest, or a failure or dispute of reporting or diligence efforts arise between our current or future licensees or collaboration partners, if any, and us, any of them may act in their self-interest, which may be adverse to our interests.\nIf a conflict of interest arises between us and one or more of our current or potential future licensees or collaboration partners, if any, they may act in their own self-interest or otherwise in a way that is not in the interest of our company or our stockholders. Biogen, Takeda, or potential future licensees or collaboration partners, if any, are conducting or may conduct product development efforts within the disease area that is the subject of a license or collaboration with our company. In current or potential future licenses or collaborations, if any, we have agreed or may agree not to conduct, independently or with any third party, any research that is competitive with the research conducted under our licenses or collaborations. Our licensees or collaboration partners, however, may develop, either alone or with others, products in related fields that are competitive with the product candidates that are the subject of these licenses or collaborations. Competing products, either developed by our licensees or collaboration partners or to which our licensees or collaboration partners have rights, may result in their withdrawal of support for a product candidate covered by the license or collaboration agreement.\nIf one or more of our current or potential future licensees or collaboration partners, if any, were to breach or terminate their license or collaboration agreements with us or otherwise fail to perform their obligations thereunder in a timely manner, the preclinical or clinical development or commercialization of the affected product candidates could be delayed or terminated. We do not know whether our licensees or collaboration partners will pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative product candidates, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by licenses or collaboration agreements with our company.\nWe and our current collaboration partners have certain reporting and diligence obligations to each other, and failure to report, or disagreement over the impact of information reported, or a lack of diligent efforts, or dispute of the impact of the efforts, may be adverse to our interests, the development of the product candidates and could lead to an ultimate withdrawal or dispute of the rights to a product candidate covered by the license or collaboration agreement.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. New or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from potential revenue-generating activities to compliance matters. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed. Further, our board members, chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business.\nRaising funds through lending arrangements or revenue participation agreements may restrict our operations or produce other adverse results.\nOur loan and security agreement (\u201cthe Loan Agreement\u201d), with Bridge Bank, a division of Western Alliance Bank (Western Bank\u201d) and Solar Capital Ltd (\u201cSolar Capital\u201d, and collectively with Western Bank, \u201cthe Lenders\u201d) and Western Alliance, as Collateral Agent (the \u201cCollateral Agent\u201d), contains a variety of affirmative covenants, including, without limitation, certain information delivery requirements, obligations to maintain certain insurance and certain notice requirements. Additionally, we are bound by certain negative covenants setting forth actions that are not permitted to be taken during the term of the Loan Agreement without the Lenders\u2019 consent, including, without limitation, incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain asset dispositions, entering into certain mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions or incurring any non-permitted lien or other encumbrance on our assets. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement (subject to cure periods for certain events of default), all amounts owed by us thereunder would begin to bear interest at a rate that is 5.0% higher than the rate that would otherwise be applicable and may be declared immediately due and payable by the Collateral Agent. Events of default under the Loan Agreement include, among other things, the following: the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events; the failure to make payments under the Loan Agreement when due; the occurrence of a material impairment on the Collateral Agent\u2019s security interest over the collateral, a material adverse change in our business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) or material impairment of the prospect of repayment of the obligations under the Loan Agreement; the occurrence of a default under certain other agreements entered into by us; the rendering of certain types of judgments against us; the revocation of our certain government approvals of; any breach by us of any covenant (subject to cure periods for certain covenants) made in the Loan Agreement; and the failure of any representation or warranty made by us in connection with the Loan Agreement to be correct in all material respects when made.\nOn October 31, 2017, we entered into a second amendment to the Amended Loan Agreement (the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d). The Second amendment modified the loan repayment terms to allow us to extend the interest-only period to January 1, 2019, contingent upon the receipt of at least Twenty-Five Million dollars ($25,000,000) in unrestricted net cash proceeds from the issuance by us of new equity securities or as a non-refundable upfront payment on a new business development agreement or royalty financing agreement (the \u201cNew Capital\u201d), on or after October 24, 2017, but on or prior to September 15, 2018. There is a risk that we may not be able to raise the required New Capital for the extended interest-only period and if we do not, we must begin repaying the principal after October 1, 2018.\nThe Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, has a perfected security interest in substantially all of our property, rights and assets, except for intellectual property, to secure the payment of all amounts owed to the Lenders under the Loan Agreement.\nWe are exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nSome of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies. When the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro or British pound, the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense increases, and when the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro or British pound, the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense decreases. Consequently, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar, may adversely affect our results of operations. We have and may continue to purchase certain European currencies or highly-rated investments denominated in such currencies to manage the risk of future movements in foreign exchange rates that would affect such payables, in accordance with our investment policy. However, there is no guarantee that the related gains and losses will substantially offset each other, and we may be subject to significant exchange gains or losses as currencies fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster, or interruption by man-made problems such as network security breaches, viruses or terrorism, could cause damage to our facilities and equipment, which could require us to cease or curtail operations.\nOur facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fires, floods, power loss, communications failures and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our networks also may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. We rely on information technology systems to operate our business and to communicate among our workforce and with third parties. If any disruption were to occur, whether caused by a natural disaster or by manmade problems, our ability to operate our business at our facilities may be seriously or completely impaired and our data could be lost or destroyed.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approval for the commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, selling and marketing of product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor our present or potential future collaboration or licensing partners, if any, are permitted to market our product candidates in Europe or the United States until we receive approval of an MAA or NDA for these respective territories, or in any other country without the equivalent marketing approval from such country. We have not received marketing approval for vecabrutinib in any jurisdiction. In addition, failure to comply with FDA, EMA, and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizure or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production, and refusal to approve pending MAAs, NDAs, supplements to approved MAAs, NDAs or their equivalents in other territories.\nRegulatory approval of an MAA or NDA or their equivalent in other territories is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive, uncertain and may take several years. Furthermore, the development process for oncology products may take longer than in other therapeutic areas. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the drug approval process. Despite the time and expense exerted, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for marketing approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address, and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate.\nThe FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authority can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe drug candidate may not be deemed safe or effective;\n\u2022\nregulatory officials may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient;\n\u2022\nthe FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authority might not approve our or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 processes or facilities; or\n\u2022\nthe FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authority may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nWe may be subject to costly claims related to our clinical trials and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance.\nBecause we conduct clinical trials in humans, we face the risk that the use of vecabrutinib, SNS-510, vosaroxin or future product candidates, if any, will result in adverse side effects. We cannot predict the possible harms or side effects that may result from our clinical trials. Although we have clinical trial liability insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover any such events. We do not know whether we will be able to continue to obtain clinical trial coverage on acceptable terms, or at all. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limit of, our insurance coverage. There is also a risk that third parties that we have agreed to indemnify could incur liability. Any litigation arising from our clinical trials, even if we were ultimately successful, would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and may create adverse publicity.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to sell vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or other product candidates, the market may not be receptive.\nEven if one of our product candidates obtains regulatory approval, it may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and/or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe efficacy of our product;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nthe potential advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe price of the product, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of reimbursement from health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors.\nIf vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or other product candidates fail to achieve market acceptance, due to unacceptable side effects or any other reasons, we may not be able to generate significant revenue or to achieve or sustain profitability.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or any other future product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing FDA, EMA and other regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize vecabrutinib, vosaroxin or any other future product candidate.\nAny regulatory approvals that we or our potential future collaboration partners receive for vecabrutinib, SNS-510, or our future product candidates, if any, may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing trials. In addition, even if approved, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for any product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product, and could include withdrawal of the product from the market.\nThe FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and DOJ impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.\nRegulatory policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in Europe, the United States or other territories. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we might not be permitted to market vosaroxin or our future products and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. Other penalties for failing to comply with regulatory requirements include restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes; restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product; restrictions on distribution or use of a product; requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials; warning letters or untitled letters; withdrawal of the products from\nthe market; refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; recall of products; damage to relationships with any potential collaborators; unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation; fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues; suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals; refusal to permit the import or export of our products; product seizure; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and litigation involving patients using our products. Additionally, failure to comply with the European Union\u2019s requirements regarding the protection of personal information also can lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nThe coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved drugs is uncertain and may be impacted by current and future legislation, and failure to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement could limit our ability to market our product candidates and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the third party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs both nationally and internationally. The commercial success of our future products, if any, in both domestic and international markets depends on whether third-party coverage and reimbursement is available for the ordering of our future products by the medical profession for use by their patients. Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to manage healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our future products. These payors may not view our future products as cost-effective, and reimbursement may not be available to consumers or may not be sufficient to allow our future products to be marketed on a competitive basis.\nLikewise, in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative or regulatory efforts to control or reduce healthcare costs or reform government healthcare programs that could result in lower prices or rejection of our future products. Such efforts have resulted in several recent United States congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. Changes in coverage and reimbursement policies or healthcare cost containment initiatives that may limit or restrict reimbursement for our future products may reduce any future product revenue.\nAdditionally, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, was enacted, which made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. In the years since its enactment, there have been, and continue to be, significant developments in, and continued legislative activity around, attempts to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA. Due to these efforts, there is significant uncertainty regarding the future of the ACA, and its impact our business and operations.\nThe implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, clinical investigators, and third party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, in the event of a violation, could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, clinical investigators, and third party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, clinical investigators and third party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable state, federal and foreign healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nThe federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nFederal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid;\n\u2022\nHIPAA prohibits, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, among other things, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH, among other things, makes HIPAA\u2019s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity; created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties; amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates; and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions to enforce the federal HIPAA laws;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nanalogous local, state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, transparency statutes, and privacy and security laws. Such laws may be broader than the federal law, including that they may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by third party payors, including private insurers. There also are an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, other remuneration and items of value provided to health care professionals and health care entities, or marketing expenditures; require pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs or codes of conducts; and/or require a pharmaceutical company\u2019s sales representatives to be registered or licensed by the state or local governmental entity. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to a wide range of sanctions and penalties, including potentially significant criminal, and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under these laws or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending any such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance and disrupt our business operations.\nForeign governments often impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nIf we or a potential future collaboration partner obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we or the potential future collaboration partner will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, prescription drug pricing is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or a potential future collaboration partner may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. If reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe, through third-party contractors, use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business and are subject to a variety of federal, state, regional and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. Although we believe our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage, which is limited for pollution cleanup and contamination.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may continue to be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nIn 2017, our common stock traded as low as $1.82 and as high as $4.45. Factors that could cause continued volatility in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nall the other risks mentioned herein, including but not limited to our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and complete our clinical development plans, compliance with government regulations, the safety and efficacy of our products, and our ability to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to restructuring and other operational changes;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to our arrangements with Biogen, Takeda or RPI;\n\u2022\nactual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ndeviations in our operating results from the estimates of analysts;\n\u2022\nlitigation or public concern about the safety of future products, if any;\n\u2022\nfailure to develop or sustain an active and liquid trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nshort-selling or manipulation of our common stock by investors;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nProvisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult to change management.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders might otherwise consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors so that not all directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our stockholders\u2019 ability to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nan advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine.\nIn addition, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person who, together with its affiliates, owns or within the last three years has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nProvisions in our charter documents and provisions of Delaware law could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, under the terms of our Loan Agreement with the Lenders, we are precluded from paying cash dividends without the prior written consent of the Lenders. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.", "PERMNO": 90907, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SNSS"}
