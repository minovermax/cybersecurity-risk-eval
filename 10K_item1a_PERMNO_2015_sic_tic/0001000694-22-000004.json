RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. A number of risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that are indicated by forward-looking statements. Some risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate. Others relate principally to the securities market and ownership of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. Any of the following risks could result in material adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. You also should consider the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our other filings with the SEC.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. The following is a summary of the principal risk factors described in this section:\n\u2022We have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain.\n\u2022We will continue to require significant funding to maintain our current level of operations and fund the further development of our vaccine candidates.\n\u2022Because our vaccine product development efforts depend on new and rapidly evolving technologies, our efforts may not succeed.\n\u2022The regulatory and commercial success of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, remains uncertain. While we have received provisional registration, conditional marketing authorization, or emergency use authorization for NVX-CoV2373 in a number of jurisdictions, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in the United States or in any other jurisdiction or produce a successful vaccine in a timely manner, if at all.\n\u2022We are a biotechnology company and face significant risk in developing, manufacturing, and commercializing our products.\n\u2022Because we depend on third parties to conduct some of our laboratory testing and clinical trials, and a significant amount of our vaccine manufacturing and distribution, we may encounter delays in or lose some control over our efforts to develop and supply products.\n\u2022Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and experience, which may negatively impact our commercial opportunities and those of our current and future licensees.\n\u2022There is significant competition in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, influenza, and RSV and we may never see returns on the significant resources we are devoting to our vaccine candidates.\n\u2022We may not succeed in obtaining the FDA licensure or foreign regulatory approvals necessary to sell our vaccine candidates.\n\u2022Our products might fail to meet their primary endpoints in clinical trials, meaning that we will not have the clinical data required to support regulatory obligations.\n\u2022The regulatory pathway for NVX-CoV2373 is continually evolving, and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\n\u2022We have conducted, are conducting, and plan to conduct in the future, a number of clinical trials for NVX-CoV2373 at sites outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\n\u2022The later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer, or facility may result in restrictions, including withdrawal of a vaccine that had previously received regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions from the market.\n\u2022Our success depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.\n\u2022Our business may be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our business development initiatives.\n\u2022Servicing our 3.75% convertible senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow resources to pay our debt.\n\u2022Because our stock price has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile, the market price of our common stock may be lower or more volatile than expected.\n\u2022Litigation or regulatory investigations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.\n\u2022We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural or man-made disasters or public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain.\nOur expenses have exceeded our revenue since our formation in 1987, and our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2021 was $3.6 billion. Our revenue and expenses fluctuate significantly from period to period. For most of our history our expenses have exceeded our revenue, which may occur during most periods in the foreseeable future. Our net losses for the last three fiscal years were $1.7 billion in 2021, $418.3 million in 2020, and $132.7 million in 2019.\nHistorically, our losses have resulted predominantly from research and development expenses for our vaccine candidates, manufacturing-related expenses, expenses associated with efforts to obtain regulatory approvals, costs related to protection of our intellectual property, and other general and administrative operating expenses, a significant portion of which have been noncash. Our expenses have exceeded our revenue since inception, and we believe our expenses will fluctuate over time, and may substantially increase in some years, as a result of continuing efforts to develop, test, manufacture, and make regulatory filings for our vaccine candidates, and, if our product candidates are approved, commercialization efforts.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2021, our investment in the development and manufacture of NVX-CoV2373 has been substantial, and we expect such levels of investment to continue for the rest of 2022 and beyond, although the precise magnitude of our total investment will depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the competitive landscape, the timing and results of our applications for regulatory approvals, the availability of funding, and whether and what booster shot protocols are recommended by governments, regulatory authorities, and healthcare providers. If we are unable to timely commercialize a vaccine against COVID-19 in sufficient jurisdictions, we likely would never recoup our investments. We expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and anticipate significant losses over time as we seek to:\n\u2022conduct additional clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for NVX-CoV2373 and other potential vaccine candidates;\n\u2022conduct preclinical studies for other potential vaccine candidates;\n\u2022expand our global manufacturing and distribution capacity; and\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.\nAs a result, we expect our cumulative operating losses to increase until such time, if ever, that product sales, licensing fees, royalties, milestones, contract research and other sources generate sufficient revenue to fully fund our operations. We may never achieve profitability and may not sustain profitability, if achieved.\nWe will continue to require significant funding to maintain our current level of operations and fund the further development of our vaccine candidates.\nWe do not currently generate sufficient revenue from product sales, licensing fees, royalties, milestones, contract research or other sources to fully fund our operations. We, therefore, will use our cash resources, and expect to require additional funds, to maintain our operations, continue our research and development programs, commence future preclinical studies and clinical trials, seek regulatory approvals and manufacture and market any products that are approved for commercialization.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities, government funding and grant agreements, and additional funding may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Although we have entered into supply agreements for NVX-CoV2373 that include prepayments from the purchasers, until we can generate sufficient product revenue in amounts sufficient to fully fund our operations, which we may never do, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of additional public or private equity or debt financings, as well as existing cash, potential collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements, funding from governmental and non-governmental funding entities, and potentially other sources. While we may continue to apply for contracts or grants from academic institutions, non-profit organizations and governmental entities, we may not be successful. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, negative interpretations of clinical trial data or setbacks, or perceived setbacks, with respect to manufacturing ability and/or capacity or regulatory filing timelines for NVX-CoV2373 or our other vaccine candidates, as well as the competitive landscape posed by other COVID-19 vaccines, may impair our ability to raise additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, certain of the supply agreements for NVX-CoV2373 may be terminated by the counterparty if we do not timely achieve requisite regulatory approval for NVX-CoV2373 in the relevant jurisdictions under such agreements. If we cannot raise the additional funds required for our anticipated operations, we may be required to delay significantly, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, downsize our organization, or seek alternative measures to avoid insolvency, including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or vaccine candidates. If we raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock or other securities, such offerings would cause dilution of current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in the Company, which could be substantial. Future offerings also could have a material and adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nEconomic uncertainty may adversely affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to execute our business plan as scheduled.\nGenerally, worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to capital markets is critical to our ability to operate. Traditionally, biotechnology companies have funded their research and development expenditures by raising capital in the equity markets. Declines and uncertainties in these markets in the past have severely restricted raising new capital and have affected companies\u2019 ability to continue to expand or fund existing development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization efforts. We require significant capital for our current and expected operations. The general economic and capital market conditions, both in the U.S. and worldwide, have been volatile in the past and at times have adversely affected our access to capital and increased the cost of capital. The capital and credit markets may not be available to support future capital raising activity on favorable terms. If economic conditions decline, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms, our ability to execute our business plan as contemplated would be compromised. Moreover, we rely and intend to rely on third parties, including clinical research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations and other important vendors and consultants. Global economic conditions may result in a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors and suppliers. If such third parties are unable to adequately satisfy their contractual commitments to us in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur existing funding and supply agreements do not assure success of our vaccine candidates or that we will be able to fully fund our vaccine candidates.\nThe OWS Agreement, the DoD Agreement and the CEPI funding agreement each reimburse a portion of the expenses associated with the development and commercialization of NVX-CoV2373. To the extent funding commitments in such agreements are conditioned on our meeting certain milestones or conditions, including regulatory approval in applicable jurisdictions, we may not ultimately receive the full amount of committed funds and could be exposed to urgent need for additional funding to support our NVX-CoV2373 development, manufacturing and distribution activities. For example, in\nconnection with the OWS Agreement, the USG has instructed us to prioritize alignment with the FDA on our analytic methods before conducting additional U.S. manufacturing and further indicated that the USG will not fund additional U.S. manufacturing until such agreement has been made. The OWS Agreement includes provisions giving the USG termination rights based on a determination that the funded project will not produce beneficial results commensurate with the expenditure of resources and that termination would be in the USG\u2019s interest. Such a determination would result in the loss of funding under that agreement and could result in other actions by the U.S. government. The CEPI funding agreement provides CEPI certain \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights in the event of certain breaches of that agreement. We may be unable to timely obtain additional government or private funding, if at all. Additionally, we have entered into, and plan to continue entering into, supply agreements for NVX-CoV2373 that include prepayments from the purchasers. Certain of the supply agreements may be terminated by the counterparty if we do not timely achieve requisite regulatory approval for NVX-CoV2373 in the relevant jurisdictions under such agreements. In the event we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize NVX-CoV2373 or fail to meet certain regulatory milestones or product volume or delivery timing obligations under our supply agreements, we may be required to refund significant portions of the prepayments, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition. Our inability to succeed with key clinical or development activities could jeopardize our ability to obtain licensure from the FDA or other regulatory authorities to sell NVX-CoV2373. As a result, our existing funding and supply agreements may be insufficient to fund our commercial launch.\nRisks Related to Product Development and Commercialization\nBecause our vaccine product development efforts depend on new and rapidly evolving technologies, our efforts may not succeed.\nOur vaccine development efforts depend on new, rapidly evolving technologies and on the marketability and profitability of our products. Our development efforts and, if those are successful, commercialization of NVX-CoV2373 and our other vaccines could fail for a variety of reasons, including if:\n\u2022our recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technologies, any or all of the products based on such technologies or our proprietary manufacturing process prove ineffective or unsafe;\n\u2022new strains of COVID-19 evolve, with respect to which NVX-CoV2373 proves less effective;\n\u2022we or our third-party manufacturer facilities fail to reproducibly scale-up manufacturing with sufficiently high yields at reasonable cost and on projected timelines, or such manufacturing fails to generate product that consistently satisfies purity, potency, quality, stability, and shelf-life standards necessary for obtaining regulatory approvals or achieving commercial viability;\n\u2022the products are difficult to manufacture on a large-scale or uneconomical to market;\n\u2022some or all of the products that we or our third-party partners have manufactured may be determined to be unsalable based on criteria imposed by regulators as they complete regulatory approvals;\n\u2022our in-house or third-party manufacturing facilities fail regulatory inspections;\n\u2022proprietary rights of third-parties prevent us or our collaborators from exploiting technologies, and manufacturing or marketing products; or\n\u2022third-party competitors achieve and maintain greater market share due to earlier approvals or superior marketing capabilities.\nThe regulatory and commercial success of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, remains uncertain. While we have received provisional registration, conditional marketing authorization or emergency use authorization for NVX-CoV2373 in a number of jurisdictions, we may be unable to obtain any other regulatory approvals in the United States or other jurisdictions or produce a successful vaccine in a timely manner, if at all.\nIn response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we are pursuing the development and manufacture of our vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373. Even though we have reported positive data from Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials, and have\nreceived provisional registration, conditional marketing authorization, or emergency use authorization from the World Health Organization and in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the E.U., the United Kingdom, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore, as well as full approval in South Korea, such results may not be sufficient to support regulatory submissions, authorizations and approvals, accelerated or otherwise, in any other relevant jurisdictions on our projected timelines, if at all.\nAdditionally, even though NVX-CoV2373 has received regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions and may receive further regulatory approval in others, successful commercialization depends on our ability to effectively scale up manufacturing capabilities at our own locations and those of our manufacturing partners and contractors. In May 2020, we acquired Novavax CZ (formerly Praha Vaccines, a.s.) including its vaccine manufacturing facility in Bohumil, Czech Republic and approximately 150 of its employees. We also are actively entering into agreements with third parties to manufacture the antigen component of NVAX-CoV2373 and our proprietary Matrix-M\u2122 adjuvant, as well as to distribute NVX-CoV2373. Because of contractual restraints and the limited number of third-party manufacturers with the expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture NVX-CoV2373 and its components at commercial scale, replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and time-consuming and may cause interruptions in production. Manufacturing of NVX-CoV2373 and its components involves a complicated process that will require significant investments of time and financial resources to implement, and our efforts to establish manufacturing capabilities may not meet expectations as to timing, scale-up, reproducibility, yields, purity, cost, potency or quality. Shortages of raw materials and supplies also negatively impact our manufacturing efforts. We may not be able to timely and effectively produce NVX-CoV2373 in adequate quantities to address global demand.\nWe have not previously had a commercial launch of any vaccine product, and doing so in a pandemic environment with an urgent, critical global need creates additional challenges. In addition to scaling up our manufacturing capabilities, we need to develop global distribution channels and form partnerships with third parties worldwide, as well as hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Rapid and significant growth may strain our administrative and operational infrastructure, imposing significant additional responsibilities on our organization, and our efforts to establish these capabilities may not meet expectations as to timing, scale-up, reproducibility, yields, purity, cost, potency or quality. If we fail to successfully manage our growth and the increased complexity of our operations, our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are a biotechnology company and face significant risk in developing, manufacturing and commercializing our products.\nWe focus our research and development activities on vaccines, an area in which we believe we have particular strengths and a technology that appears promising. The outcome of any research and development program is highly uncertain. Only a small fraction of biopharmaceutical development programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates and a number of events could delay our development efforts and negatively impact our ability to make regulatory submissions or obtain regulatory approval for, and to manufacture, market and sell, NVX-CoV2373 or any other vaccine on our projected timelines, if at all. Vaccine candidates that initially appear promising often fail to yield successful products, and we may not ultimately be able to demonstrate the safety, potency, purity, stability and efficacy necessary to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization to market our product candidates. In many cases, preclinical studies or clinical trials will show that a product candidate is not efficacious or that it raises safety concerns or has other side effects that outweigh its intended benefit. Success in preclinical or early clinical trials may not translate into success in large-scale clinical trials. Further, success in clinical trials often leads to increased investment, accelerating cumulative losses. Even if clinical trial results appear positive, regulatory approval may not be obtained if the FDA, or a foreign equivalent, does not agree with our interpretation of the results, and we may face challenges when scaling-up the production process to commercial levels. Even after a product is approved and launched, general usage or post-marketing clinical trials may identify safety or other previously unknown problems with the product, or manufacturing issues may emerge, either of which may result in regulatory approvals being suspended, limited to narrow the scope of the approval, or revoked, which may otherwise prevent successful commercialization. Intense competition in the vaccine industry could also limit the successful commercialization of any products for which we receive commercial approval.\nWe will require approval from the FDA of any name we intend to use for our products regardless of whether we have secured a trademark registration from the USPTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may object to any product name we submit if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt an alternative name for our proposed products. If we adopt an alternative name, we would lose the benefit of any existing trademark applications for such developmental candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a\nsuccessful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our products, if approved.\nBecause we depend on third parties to conduct some of our laboratory testing and clinical trials, and a significant amount of our vaccine manufacturing and distribution, we may encounter delays in or lose some control over our efforts to develop and supply products.\nWe are highly dependent on third-party organizations to conduct some of our laboratory testing and clinical trials and a significant amount of our vaccine manufacturing activities and distribution. If we are unable to obtain any necessary services on acceptable terms, we may not complete our product development or commercialization efforts in a timely manner. We may lose control over these activities or become too dependent upon these parties. These third parties may not complete testing, manufacturing or distribution activities on schedule, or in satisfaction of regulatory or commercial requirements. Certain of our facilities are also contracted for defined time frames and through association with OWS and CEPI, and we may not be able to access those facilities for sufficient periods of time to provide adequate supply.\nWe are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety and welfare of clinical trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies also require us to comply with good manufacturing practices. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third parties may not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations. Furthermore, if a third-party manufacturer is producing materials or products for themselves or other companies, that manufacturer is exposed to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the regulatory status of the third-party manufacturer\u2019s facility, which could impact its ability to produce our materials and products. Any of our third-party service providers may need to be replaced, the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain may be compromised, the services provided to us may be delayed, or the product they manufacture may be contaminated due to the failure to adhere to our clinical and manufacturing protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons. In any such event, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of, or successfully commercially manufacture on a timely basis, our vaccine candidates.\nThe results from the Prepare trial, including that ResVax failed to meet the primary endpoint of the trial, will likely create challenges, some of which may be significant, around further development of that vaccine.\nWhile the Prepare results suggest that ResVax, the project name for the RSV vaccine candidate, is safe and is likely efficacious in more serious manifestations of RSV disease, the trial failed to achieve its primary clinical endpoint. Not achieving the primary clinical endpoint has been viewed negatively by our investors. Although the failure to achieve the primary endpoint in the trial is not evidence that the vaccine is ineffective, it means that regulatory agencies like the FDA and EMA are likely to require additional clinical trial data prior to licensure. This development may be viewed negatively by our potential collaborators and partners, which may make the ongoing development of ResVax, and any other RSV F Vaccine candidates, more challenging.\nWe may have product liability exposure.\nThe administration of drugs or vaccines to humans, whether in clinical trials or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims. We maintain product liability insurance coverage for our current clinical programs, including our NVX-CoV2373 trials, and we have expanded our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products. However, we may not be able to obtain additional insurance coverage or maintain insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms, at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. Furthermore, such insurance coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy all liabilities that result from product liability claims. A successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable terms, if at all. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such a claim would be time- consuming and expensive, may damage our reputation in the marketplace and would likely divert management\u2019s attention.\nIn addition, because we are developing NVX-CoV2373 in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, a global pandemic, we have received provisional registration, conditional marketing authorization or emergency use authorization from the World Health Organization and in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the E.U., the United Kingdom, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore, as well as full authorization in South Korea, and we may have a widely used vaccine as an investigational vaccine or a product authorized for temporary or emergency use prior to our receipt of marketing approval in\nother jurisdictions as well. Unexpected safety issues in these circumstances could lead to product liability claims and our existing insurance may not be adequate for such claims.\nRegardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for our products;\n\u2022withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022voluntary or mandatory recalls of our products;\n\u2022necessity for additional nonclinical or clinical studies, changes in labeling, or changes to manufacturing processes, specifications and/or facilities;\n\u2022impairment of our business reputation and negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022costs of related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to participants or other claimants;\n\u2022loss of revenue; and\n\u2022inability to commercialize our vaccine candidates.\nIn the United States, the PREP Act provides immunity for manufacturers from all claims under state or federal law for \u201closs\u201d arising out of the administration or use of a \u201ccovered countermeasure.\u201d However, injured persons may still bring a suit for \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d against the manufacturer under some circumstances. \u201cCovered countermeasures\u201d include security countermeasures and \u201cqualified pandemic or epidemic products\u201d, including products intended to diagnose or treat pandemic or epidemic disease, such as pandemic vaccines, as well as treatments intended to address conditions caused by such products. For these immunities to apply, the Secretary of DHHS must issue a declaration in cases of public health emergency or \u201ccredible risk\u201d of a future public health emergency. On March 17, 2020, the Secretary of DHHS issued a declaration under the PREP Act and has issued subsequent amendments thereto to provide liability immunity for activities related to certain countermeasures against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While we believe our products would be covered under the provisions of the PREP Act, this cannot be assured. Also, the Secretary of the HHS may not make other declarations in the future that cover any of our other product candidates, and the U.S. Congress may reduce coverage under the PREP Act or repeal it altogether. Product liability lawsuits may result in substantial liabilities and may require us to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf we are unable to effectively manufacture our vaccines in sufficient quantities, at sufficient yields or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for a manufacturing facility for our vaccines, we may experience delays or an adverse impact on product development, clinical trials, regulatory approval and commercial distribution.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our vaccine candidates require access to, or development of, facilities to effectively manufacture our vaccine candidates at sufficient yields and at commercial-scale. We have limited experience manufacturing any of our vaccine candidates in the volumes necessary to support commercial sales. While we have recently increased our projected global manufacturing capacity for NVX-CoV2373, our efforts to establish manufacturing capabilities may not meet expectations as to timing, scale-up, reproducibility, yields, purity, cost, potency or quality. The antigen component of NVX-CoV2373 is currently being manufactured at Novavax CZ, as well as numerous partnered manufacturing sites, including FUJIFILM in the United States, SIIPL in India, SK bioscience in Korea, and Takeda in Japan, among others. Challenges manufacturing either the antigen component or the adjuvant, or issues in later manufacturing stages, could compromise production of NVX-CoV2373.\nManufacturing our vaccine candidates involves a complicated process with which we have limited experience. We are highly dependent on third-party organizations to conduct a significant amount of our vaccine manufacturing activities. If\nwe and our third-party manufacturing organizations are unable to manufacture our vaccine candidates in clinical quantities or, if and when necessary, in commercial quantities and at sufficient yields and at required specifications, then commercialization will be delayed, and we will need to identify and reach supply arrangements with additional third parties. Third-party manufacturers also must receive FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory body approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial product. Our vaccines are in competition with other products for access to these third-party facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third parties prioritize other products. We may not be able to enter into any necessary additional third-party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms, or on a timely basis. In addition, we have to enter into technical transfer agreements and share our know-how with the third-party manufacturers, which can be time-consuming and may result in delays.\nBecause of contractual restraints and the limited number of third-party manufacturers with the expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture our bulk vaccines at commercial-scale, replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and time-consuming and may cause interruptions in the production of our vaccine. We and our third-party manufacturers may also encounter production challenges related to:\n\u2022costs, scale up, and yields;\n\u2022shortages of raw materials and supplies;\n\u2022quality control and assurance;\n\u2022contamination, lot consistency, potency, and purity;\n\u2022shortages of qualified personnel and other capacity constraints;\n\u2022compliance with strictly enforced and evolving federal, state and foreign regulations that vary in each country where products might be sold including nationalization or other territory restrictions placed on our owned and third-party manufacturing sites; and\n\u2022capital funding.\nDelays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must identify vaccines for development with our technologies and establish successful third-party relationships.\nThe near and long-term viability of our vaccine candidates depend in part on our ability to successfully establish new strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies. Establishing strategic collaborations and obtaining government funding is difficult and time-consuming. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or based on their internal pipelines; government agencies may reject contract or grant applications based on their assessment of public need, the public interest, our products\u2019 ability to address these areas, or other reasons beyond our expectations or control. Collaborators also may seek to modify or terminate relationships. Past success in establishing strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, non-profit organizations and government agencies in the past is no guarantee of future success in entering into new relationships or in performing under existing relationships. If we fail to establish a sufficient number of collaborations or government relationships on acceptable terms, or fail to perform under collaborations or relationships to the satisfaction of counter-parties, we may not be able to commercialize our vaccine candidates or generate sufficient revenue to fund further research and development efforts.\nThe collaborations we have established or may establish may not result in the successful development or commercialization of any vaccine candidates for several reasons, including the fact that:\n\u2022we may not have the ability to control the activities of our partners and cannot provide assurance that they will fulfill their obligations to us, including with respect to the license, development and commercialization of vaccine candidates, in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022such partners may not devote sufficient resources to our vaccine candidates or properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022our partners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our vaccine candidates if such partners believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022any failure on the part of our partners to perform or satisfy their obligations to us could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of our vaccine candidates and affect our ability to realize product revenue; and\n\u2022disagreements, including disputes over the ownership of technology developed with such collaborators, could result in litigation, which would be time consuming and expensive, and may delay or terminate research and development efforts, regulatory approvals and commercialization activities.\nIf we or our collaborators fail to maintain our existing agreements or in the event we fail to establish agreements as necessary, we could be required to undertake research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities solely at our own expense. These activities would significantly increase our capital requirements and, given our lack of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, significantly delay the commercialization of our vaccine candidates.\nEven though we have received provisional registration, conditional marketing authorization or emergency use authorization in certain jurisdictions for NVX-CoV2373, and even if we have products licensed in additional markets, our vaccine products may not be initially or ever profitable.\nWhether we make a profit from the sale of our vaccine products is dependent on a number of variables, including the costs we incur manufacturing, testing and releasing, packaging and shipping such vaccine product. Additionally, the CEPI funding agreement necessitates that we allocate a certain number of doses of NVX-CoV2373 to certain middle and lower income countries, and the Grant Agreement with BMGF necessitates that we commit to a specific amount of sales in certain specified middle and lower income countries, which may impact negatively our ability to generate profit. We cannot predict when, if at all, our approved vaccine products will be profitable to the Company.\nEven if we successfully commercialize any of our vaccine candidates, either alone or in collaboration, we face uncertainty with respect to pricing, third-party reimbursement and healthcare reform, all of which could adversely affect any commercial success of our vaccine candidates.\nOur ability to collect revenue from the commercial sale of our vaccines may depend on our ability, and that of any current or potential future collaboration partners or customers, to obtain adequate levels of approval, coverage and reimbursement for such products from third-party payers such as:\n\u2022government health administration authorities such as the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\n\u2022private health insurers;\n\u2022managed care organizations;\n\u2022pharmacy benefit management companies; and\n\u2022other healthcare related organizations.\nThird-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and may deny coverage or offer inadequate levels of reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed product has not received appropriate clearances from the FDA, or foreign equivalent, or other government regulators; is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the third-party payer; or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Prices could also be driven down by managed care organizations that control or significantly influence utilization of healthcare products.\nIn both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell vaccines and could adversely affect the prices that we receive for our vaccine candidates, if approved. Some of these proposed and implemented reforms could result in reduced pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement rates for medical products, and while we have no current vaccines available for commercial sale other than subject to provisional registration, conditional marketing authorization or emergency use authorization in certain foreign jurisdictions, the impact of such reform could nevertheless adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. For example, the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) contained several cost containment measures that could adversely affect our future revenue, including, for example, increased drug rebates under Medicaid for brand name prescription drugs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care organizations, and extension of so-called 340B discounted pricing on pharmaceuticals sold to certain healthcare providers. Additional provisions of the healthcare reform laws that may negatively affect our future revenue and prospects for profitability include the assessment of an annual fee based on our proportionate share of sales of brand name prescription drugs to certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The ACA also established a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded on drugs (including vaccines) to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the so-called \u201cdonut hole\u201d), as condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Other aspects of healthcare reform, such as expanded government enforcement authority and heightened standards that could increase compliance-related costs, could also affect our business.\nFurther, we face uncertainties because of occasional political, legislative, and administrative efforts to substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. For example, in 2017, the Trump administration withheld the cost-sharing subsidies paid to ACA health insurance exchange plans serving low-income enrollees. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) was also enacted at the end of 2017 and included provisions that affected healthcare insurance coverage and payment, such as the elimination of the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 (the so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d).\nMore recently, the Biden administration, through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, increased subsidies for coverage purchased through ACA health insurance exchanges and extended eligibility for subsidies to higher income levels. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review the case, and oral arguments were heard on November 10, 2020. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Separately, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is also unclear how these and other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA, will impact our business.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent laws, which began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which may materially adversely affect customer demand and affordability for our products and, accordingly, the results of our financial operations. Additionally, the pharmaceutical industry has also been the subject of significant publicity in recent years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, including publicity and pressure resulting from prices charged by pharmaceutical companies for new products as well as price increases by pharmaceutical companies on older products that some people have deemed excessive. As a result, pharmaceutical product prices have been the focus of increased scrutiny by the U.S. government, including certain state attorneys general, members of congress, presidential candidates and the United States Department of Justice. If reforms in the health care industry make reimbursement for our potential products less likely, the market for our potential products will be reduced, and we could lose potential sources of revenue. The existence or threat of cost control measures could cause our corporate collaborators to be less willing or able to pursue research and development programs related to our vaccine candidates. Further, it is also possible\nthat additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.\nEven if we receive regulatory approvals for our vaccine candidates, including NVX-CoV2373, coverage and reimbursement may be subject to unique regulatory policies. For example, under the ACA preventive care mandate, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage offered in the individual or group market typically have at least one year before they must provide first-dollar coverage for a newly issued preventive care requirement or guideline. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage offered in the individual or group market must cover any qualifying coronavirus preventive service 15 business days after the United States Preventive Services Task Force, or Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) designates such service as preventive. Further, third-party reimbursement for providers administering COVID-19 vaccines may affect market acceptance of NVX-CoV2373, if we receive regulatory approval. Currently, the CARES Act and its implementing regulations state that (i) providers that participate in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccination Program must administer a COVID-19 immunization regardless of an individual\u2019s ability to pay or health insurance coverage status, (ii) providers may not seek any reimbursement, including through balance billing, from an immunization recipient, (iii) coverage is required, without cost-sharing, for the administration of the immunization even if a third party, such as the federal government, pays for the cost of the immunization, and (iv) private health insurance plans must cover COVID-19 immunizations and their administration even when provided by out-of-network providers for the duration of the public health emergency for COVID-19. Even if we receive regulatory approvals for NVX-CoV2373, there is no guarantee payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product after the termination of the public health emergency, nor can we guarantee that even if coverage is provided, the reimbursement amount will be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. We cannot predict continued prevalence of COVID-19, whether herd immunity will be achieved (which would affect the need for future administration of COVID-19 vaccines), or whether NVX-CoV2373 will be effective against continuing mutations or variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nWe have limited marketing capabilities, and if we are unable to enter into collaborations with marketing partners or develop our own sales and marketing capability, we may not be successful in commercializing any approved products.\nAlthough we have initiated preliminary activities in anticipation of commercialization of our vaccine candidates, we currently have limited dedicated sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. As a result, we depend on collaborations with third parties that have established distribution systems and sales forces, including our collaboration with SIIPL, among others. To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other licensing arrangements, our revenue will depend upon the efforts of third parties, over which we may have little or no control. If we are unable to reach and maintain agreements with one or more pharmaceutical companies or collaborators, we may be required to market our products directly. Developing a marketing and sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay a product launch. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified sales personnel or otherwise develop this capability.\nOur vaccine candidates may never achieve market acceptance even if we obtain regulatory approvals.\nEven if we receive regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our vaccine candidates, the commercial success of these vaccine candidates will depend on, among other things, their acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payers, such as health insurance companies and other members of the medical community, as a vaccine and cost-effective alternative to competing products. If our vaccine candidates fail to gain market acceptance, we may be unable to earn sufficient revenue to continue our business. Market acceptance of, and demand for, any product that we may develop and commercialize will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy (including against emerging COVID-19 variants);\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022whether our vaccines are differentiated from other vaccines;\n\u2022availability, relative cost and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our marketing and distribution strategy;\n\u2022publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u2022our ability to obtain sufficient third party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nIf our vaccine candidates do not become widely accepted by physicians, patients, third-party payers and other members of the medical community, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to secure sufficient supplies of a key component of our adjuvant technology.\nBecause an important component of our adjuvant technology is extracted from a species of soap-bark tree (Quillaja saponaria) grown in Chile, we need long term access to quillaja extract with a consistent and sufficiently high quality. We need a secure supply of raw material, as well as back-up suppliers, or our adjuvant products may be delayed and we may not be able to meet our obligations under our various collaboration and supply agreements.\nCurrent or future regional relationships may hinder our ability to engage in larger transactions.\nWe have entered into regional collaborations to develop, manufacture and distribute our vaccine candidates in certain parts of the world, and we anticipate entering into additional regional collaborations. Our relationships with SIIPL, Takeda, SK bioscience and BMGF are examples of these regional relationships. These relationships often involve the licensing of our technology to our partner or entering into a distribution agreement, frequently on an exclusive basis. Generally, exclusive agreements are restricted to certain territories. Because we have entered into exclusive license and distribution agreements, larger companies may not be interested, or able, to enter into collaborations with us on a worldwide-scale. Also, these regional relationships may make us an unattractive target for an acquisition.\nOur product candidates are sensitive to shipping and storage conditions, which could subject our vaccine candidates to risk of loss or damage.\nOur vaccine candidates are sensitive to storage and handling conditions. Loss in vaccine candidates could occur if the product or product intermediates are not stored or handled properly. It is possible that our vaccine candidates could be lost due to expiration prior to use. If we do not effectively maintain our supply logistics, then we may experience an unusual number of returned or out of date products. Failure to effectively maintain our supply logistics, by us or third parties, could lead to additional manufacturing costs and delays in our ability to supply required quantities for clinical trials or otherwise.\nOur vaccine candidates could become subject to a product recall which could harm our reputation, business, and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of certain vaccine candidates. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a product is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or our strategic collaborators could occur as a result of manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our vaccine candidates would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales, if any.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Competition\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater resources and experience, which may negatively impact our commercial opportunities and those of our current and future licensees.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change. We have many potential competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology firms, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise in:\n\u2022research and development;\n\u2022preclinical testing;\n\u2022designing and implementing clinical trials;\n\u2022regulatory processes and approvals;\n\u2022production and manufacturing; and\n\u2022sales and marketing of approved products.\nPrincipal competitive factors in our industry include:\n\u2022the quality and breadth of an organization\u2019s technology;\n\u2022management of the organization and the execution of the organization\u2019s strategy;\n\u2022the skill and experience of an organization\u2019s employees and its ability to recruit and retain skilled and experienced employees;\n\u2022an organization\u2019s intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022the range of capabilities, from target identification and validation to drug discovery and development to manufacturing and marketing; and\n\u2022the availability of substantial capital resources to fund discovery, development and commercialization activities.\nLarge and established companies, such as Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, CSL Ltd., Sanofi Pasteur, SA, Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and Moderna, among others, compete in the vaccine market. In particular, these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, manufacturing such products on a broad scale and marketing approved products.\nRegardless of the disease, smaller or early-stage companies and research institutions also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical companies. As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop proprietary positions, which may prevent or limit our product development and commercialization efforts. We will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and participant registration for clinical trials and in acquiring and in-licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business. If any of our competitors succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we do or for products that are more effective or less costly than ours, our commercial opportunity could be significantly reduced.\nIn order to effectively compete, we will have to make substantial investments in development, testing, manufacturing and sales and marketing or partner with one or more established companies. We may not be successful in gaining significant market share for any vaccine. Our technologies and vaccines also may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive as a result of products introduced by our competitors to the marketplace more rapidly and at a lower cost.\nThere is significant competition in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, influenza, and RSV and we may never see returns on the significant resources we are devoting to our vaccine candidates.\nWe may be unable to produce a successful COVID-19 vaccine, and establish a competitive market share for our vaccine before the COVID-19 outbreak is contained or significantly diminished. A large number of vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions and other organizations have developed COVID-19 vaccines or are developing COVID-19 vaccine candidates. In particular, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson have received emergency use authorizations for their COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. and other countries, and many other companies, including AstraZeneca, Sinovac Biotech, Sinopharm, and Inovio are in various stages of developing and obtaining marketing authorization for COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Despite funding provided to us to date, many of our competitors pursuing vaccine candidates have significantly greater product candidate development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Larger\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for their products and may have the resources to heavily invest to accelerate discovery and development of their vaccine candidates. The success of our COVID-19 vaccine will depend, in part, on its relative safety, efficacy (including against emerging variant strains), side effect profile, convenience, and cost. COVID-19 vaccines approved prior to our vaccine satisfy a portion of the demand for initial vaccinations, and we no longer have access to that opportunity. In addition, COVID-19 vaccines approved prior to our vaccine may develop broad market acceptance that we are challenged to overcome. For example, in the U.S. the FDA amended the Pfizer-BioNTech EUA on September 22, 2021, and the Moderna EUA and Johnson & Johnson EUA on October 20, 2021, to authorize the use of a single booster dose for certain populations after completion of primary vaccination with any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA then amended both of these Pfizer-BioNTech EUA and the Moderna EUA again on November 19, 2021, to authorize the use of such a single booster dose for all patients 18 years and older. On December 9, 2021, the FDA amended only the Pfizer-BioNTech EUA to authorize the use of the single booster dose for all patients 16 years and older. On January 3, 2022, the FDA further amended the Pfizer-BioNTech EUA again to authorize the use of the single booster dose for all patients 12 years and older and third pediatric doses for 5-11-year-old solid organ transplant patients or patients with a similar level of immunocompromise. Furthermore, if any competitors are successful in producing a more efficacious vaccine or other treatment for COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), or if any competitors are able to manufacture and distribute any such vaccines or treatments with greater efficiency there may be a diversion of potential governmental and other funding away from us and toward such other parties.\nWe are allocating significant financial and personnel resources to the development of NVX-CoV2373, which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to combating a global health threat that is unpredictable or against which our vaccine, if commercialized, may ultimately prove unsuccessful or unprofitable.\nMany seasonal influenza vaccines are currently approved and marketed. Competition in the sale of these seasonal influenza vaccines is intense. Therefore, newly developed and approved products must be differentiated from existing vaccines in order to have commercial success. In order to show differentiation in the seasonal influenza market, a product may need to be more efficacious, particularly in older adults, and/or be less expensive or quicker to manufacture. Many competitors are working on new products and new generations of current products, intended to be more efficacious than those currently marketed. Our nanoparticle seasonal influenza vaccine candidate may not prove to be more efficacious than current products or products under development by our competitors. Further, our in-house or third-party manufacturing arrangements may not provide enough savings of time or money to provide the required differentiation for commercial success.\nWe are also aware that there are multiple companies with active RSV vaccine programs at various stages of development. Thus, while there is no RSV vaccine currently on the market, there is likely to be significant and consistent competition as these active programs mature. Different RSV vaccines may work better for different segments of the population, so it may be difficult for a single RSV vaccine manufacturer to provide vaccines that are marketable to multiple population segments. Geographic markets are also likely to vary significantly, which may make it difficult to market a single RSV vaccine worldwide. Even if a manufacturer brings an RSV vaccine to license, it is likely that competitors will continue to work on new products that could be more efficacious and/or less expensive. Our RSV vaccine candidate may not be as far along in development as other active RSV vaccine programs about which we are not aware, nor as efficacious as products under development by competing companies. Even if our RSV vaccine candidate receives regulatory approval, it may not achieve significant sales if other, more effective vaccines under development by our competitors are also approved.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Compliance Matters\nWe may not succeed in obtaining the FDA licensure or foreign regulatory approvals necessary to sell our vaccine candidates.\nThe development, manufacture and marketing of our pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to government regulation by the U.S. FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Czech Republic\u2019s State Institute for Drug Control (SUKL) with respect to our manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic and the Swedish Medical Products Agency (L\u00e4kemedelsverket, LV) with respect to our adjuvant product being developed in Sweden, as well as other country authorities into which active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients are imported and/or manufactured by us or our sub-contracted manufacturers. In the U.S. and most foreign countries, we must complete rigorous preclinical testing and extensive clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory approval to market the product. Additionally, we must demonstrate that our manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate with respect to such product to assure safety, purity and potency and comply with applicable good manufacturing practice requirements. None of our vaccine candidates has yet gained regulatory approval in the U.S., although NVX-CoV2373 has received provisional registration, conditional marketing authorization or emergency\nuse authorization in certain other jurisdictions. We also have vaccine candidates in clinical trials and preclinical laboratory or animal studies.\nOur products might fail to meet their primary endpoints in clinical trials, meaning that we will not have the clinical data required to support regulatory obligations.\nThe steps generally required by the FDA before our proposed investigational products may be marketed in the U.S. include:\n\u2022performance of preclinical (animal and laboratory) tests;\n\u2022submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may commence;\n\u2022performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product in the intended target population;\n\u2022performance of a consistent and reproducible manufacturing process at commercial scale capable of passing FDA inspection;\n\u2022submission to the FDA of a BLA or a NDA; and\n\u2022FDA approval of the BLA or NDA before any commercial sale or shipment of the product.\nClinical trials that we undertake in other countries will be subject to similar or equivalent processes and requirements, In Europe, as well as an authorization for the trial itself, it is necessary to obtain the consent of a local ethics committee for each trial site and to provide for publication specific information about the trial and its outcome. If endpoints are not met, this information will be made publicly available and could be damaging to the reputation of the Company.\nThese processes are expensive and can take many years to complete, and we may not be able to demonstrate the safety, purity, potency and efficacy of our vaccine candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities. The start of clinical trials can be delayed or take longer than anticipated for many and varied reasons, many of which are out of our control. Safety concerns may emerge that could lengthen the ongoing clinical trials or require additional clinical trials to be conducted. Promising results in early clinical trials may not be replicated in subsequent clinical trials. Regulatory authorities may also require additional testing, and we may be required to demonstrate that our proposed products represent an improved form of treatment over existing therapies, which we may be unable to do without conducting further clinical trials. Moreover, if a regulatory authority grants regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to its distribution. Expanded or additional indications for approved products may not be approved, which could limit our revenue. Foreign regulatory authorities may apply similar limitations or may refuse to grant any approval. Consequently, even if we believe that preclinical and clinical data are sufficient to support regulatory approval for our vaccine candidates, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities ultimately may not grant approval for commercial sale in their applicable jurisdiction, or may impose regulatory requirements that make further pursuit of approval uneconomical in one or more jurisdictions. If our vaccine candidates are not approved, our ability to generate revenue will be limited, and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products on a timely basis or comply with our continuing regulatory obligations after approval is obtained.\nDelays in obtaining regulatory approval can be extremely costly in terms of lost sales opportunities, loss of any potential marketing advantage of being early to market and increased clinical trial costs. For example, certain of our APAs and supply agreements may be terminated by the counterparty if we do not timely achieve requisite regulatory approval for NVX-CoV2373 in the relevant jurisdictions under such agreements. The speed with which we begin and complete the preclinical studies necessary to begin clinical trials, the clinical trials themselves and our applications for marketing approval will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022our ability to scale-up manufacturing capability that reproducibly generates consistent yields of product with required purity, potency and quality; that such scale-up occurs on a timely basis; and that we have access to sufficient quantities of materials for use in necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022regulatory authority review and approval of proposed clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022approval of clinical trials protocols and informed consent forms by institutional review boards responsible for overseeing the ethical conduct of the trial;\n\u2022the rate of participant enrollment and retention, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the participant population, the proximity of participants to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial and the nature of the protocol;\n\u2022unfavorable test results or side effects experienced by clinical trial participants;\n\u2022analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities, which are susceptible to varying interpretations and which interpretations could delay, limit, result in the suspension or termination of, or prevent further conduct of clinical studies or regulatory approval;\n\u2022the availability of skilled and experienced staff to conduct and monitor clinical trials and to prepare the appropriate regulatory applications; and\n\u2022changes in the policies of regulatory authorities for drug or vaccine approval during the period of product development.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory marketing approvals. We may not be permitted to continue or commence additional clinical trials. We also face the risk that the results of our clinical trials may be inconsistent with the results obtained in preclinical studies or clinical trials of similar products or that the results obtained in later phases of clinical trials may be inconsistent with those obtained in earlier phases. A number of companies in the biotechnology and product development industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after experiencing promising results in early animal and human testing.\nRegulatory agencies may require us or our collaborators to delay, restrict or discontinue clinical trials on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, we or our collaborators may be unable to submit applications to regulatory agencies within the time frame we currently expect. Once submitted, applications must be approved by various regulatory agencies before we or our collaborators can commercialize the product described in the application. All statutes and regulations governing the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change in the future, which could affect the cost of such clinical trials. Any unanticipated costs or delays in our clinical trials or regulatory submissions could delay our ability to generate revenue and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products internationally.\nWe intend to have our vaccine candidates marketed outside the U.S. In furtherance of this objective, we have entered into supply agreements with various foreign governments and international distribution agreements with commercial entities. In order to market our products in the European Union, United Kingdom, India, Asia and many other non-U.S. jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and data review. The time required to obtain foreign regulatory approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. Additionally, regulatory authorities outside the United States might not accept data from trials conducted in other countries. Although NVX-CoV2373 has received provisional registration, conditional marketing authorization or emergency use authorization in a number of jurisdictions, we may not obtain regulatory approvals in other relevant jurisdictions on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by one regulatory agency does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions, including approval by the FDA. The failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions could harm our business.\nThe regulatory pathway for NVX-CoV2373 is continually evolving and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges.\nThe regulatory pathway for NVX-CoV2373 is evolving and failure by us to comply with any laws, rules and standards, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including penalties, fines and delays in vaccine licensure. Efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to regulatory compliance activities. For example, the rules, regulations and standards governing OWS are uncertain and may evolve as the program progresses. Such rules or standards may adversely affect our plans to develop NVX-CoV2373 and failure by us to comply with any laws, rules or standards, some of which may not exist yet or may change, could result in a range of adverse consequences, such as penalties, fines or failure to receive funding.\nThe speed at which multiple stakeholders are moving to create, test and approve vaccines for COVID-19 is highly unusual and may increase the risks associated with traditional vaccine development, which typically takes between eight and ten years. Given this accelerated timeline, we and regulators, such as the FDA, the EMA, and the MHRA may make decisions more rapidly than is typical. Evolving or changing plans or priorities at the FDA or other regulatory bodies to whom we wish to apply for authorization, including based on new knowledge of COVID-19 and how the disease affects the human body, and new variants of the virus, may significantly affect the regulatory pathway for NVX-CoV2373. Results from clinical testing may raise new questions and require us to redesign proposed clinical trials, including revising proposed endpoints or adding new clinical trial sites or cohorts of subjects. In addition, the FDA\u2019s or other regulatory authorities\u2019 analysis of clinical data may differ from our interpretation, or regulators\u2019 requirements and expectations for vaccine authorization or approval may change over time, with the result that the FDA or other regulators may require that we conduct additional clinical trials or non-clinical studies. The evolving regulatory pathway may impede the development, commercialization and/or licensure of NVX-CoV2373.\nIn addition, because the path to licensure of any vaccine against COVID-19 is unclear, we may have a widely used vaccine in circulation in certain countries as an investigational vaccine or a product authorized for temporary or emergency use prior to our receipt of full marketing approval. Unexpected safety issues in these circumstances could lead to significant reputational damage for Novavax and our technology platform going forward and other issues, including delays in our other programs, the need for re-design of our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources.\nWe have conducted, continue to conduct and plan to conduct in the future, a number of clinical trials for NVX-CoV2373 at sites outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\nWe are currently conducting several clinical trials of NVX-CoV2373 at sites outside the U.S., including a Phase 3 trial partially in Mexico, a Phase 3 trial in the U.K., a Phase 2b trial in South Africa, a Phase 1/2 trial partially in Australia, a Phase 2/3 trial in India, and a Phase 1/2 trial in Japan. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S., acceptance of these data is subject to conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and be performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The trial population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. Other regulatory authorities impose equivalent requirements for their countries. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, where the data is to be used to support our U.S. NDA, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the U.S., it could result in delay pending completion of our trials conducted in the U.S. or result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and could delay or permanently halt our development of NVX-CoV2373.\nThe later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions, including withdrawal of a vaccine that had previously received regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions from the market.\nEven after a product gains regulatory approval, the product and the manufacturer of the product will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including adverse event reporting requirements and prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved uses. Failure to comply with any post-approval requirements can, among other things, result in warning letters, product seizures, recalls, substantial fines, injunctions, suspensions or revocations of marketing authorizations or licenses, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any such enforcement actions, any unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements, or any safety issues that arise with any approved products,\ncould adversely affect our ability to market products and generate revenue and thus adversely affect our ability to continue our business.\nWe also may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product, even after obtaining product approval, if previously unknown problems with the product or its manufacture are subsequently discovered. We cannot provide assurance that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise following regulatory approval. With the use of any vaccine by a wide patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that did not arise in the clinical trials of the product or that initially appeared to be unrelated to the vaccine itself and only with the collection of subsequent information were found to be causally related to the product. Any such safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products, possibly subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and our financial condition.\nOur ability to produce a successful vaccine may be curtailed by one or more government actions or interventions, which may be more likely during a global health crisis such as COVID-19.\nGiven the significant global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that one or more government entities may take actions, including under the U.S. government under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, that directly or indirectly have the effect of diminishing some of our rights or opportunities with respect to NVX-CoV2373, and the economic value of a COVID-19 vaccine to us could be limited. In addition, during a global health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where the spread of a disease needs to be controlled, closed or heavily regulated national borders create challenges and delays in our development, production and distribution activities and may necessitate that we pursue strategies to develop, produce and distribute our vaccine candidates within self-contained national or international borders or with additional safety measures or checks in place, at potentially much greater expense and with longer timeframes for public distribution.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other regulatory authorities could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise perform their normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our ability to develop or commercialize new products or services, access capital markets, or otherwise operate our business.\nThe ability of the FDA and other regulatory authorities to review and approve new product applications is affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. For example, average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough employees and stop or slow the pace of critical activities. Equally, the move of the EMA to the Netherlands from London caused a significant loss of experienced staff and the UK\u2019s MHRA\u2019s loss of funding from the E.U. has caused a loss of funding and consequently of staff. If a prolonged government shutdown or slowdown of the relevant regulatory authority occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of that Authority to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nFast Track Designation by the FDA, the issue of conditional marketing authorizations by the EMA or MHRA, or other regulatory acceleration options may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not assure approval.\nIf a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track Designation or similar fast track processes with other regulatory agencies, such as conditional marketing authorizations from the EMA or MHRA. However, Fast Track Designation or conditional authorizations do not ensure that the drug sponsor will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. The FDA granted Fast Track Designation for NVX-CoV2373 in November 2020 and for NanoFlu, our recombinant quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine candidate, in January 2020. We may also seek Fast Track Designation for more of our other vaccine candidates. If we do seek Fast Track Designation for our other vaccine candidates, we may not receive it, and even if we receive Fast Track\nDesignation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Fast Track Designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures.\nObtaining a Fast Track Designation does not change the standards for product approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even though the FDA has granted such designation for NVX-CoV2373 and NanoFlu, it may not actually result in faster clinical development or regulatory review or approval. Furthermore, such a designation does not increase the likelihood that NVX-CoV2373 or NanoFlu will receive marketing approval in the U.S.\nBecause we are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, we may be unable to conduct our business in the most advantageous manner.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, emissions and wastewater discharges, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research, including infectious disease agents. We also cannot accurately predict the extent of regulations that might result from any future legislative or administrative action. Any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations.\nOur facilities in Maryland are subject to various local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including chemicals, microorganisms and various hazardous compounds used in connection with our research and development activities. In the U.S., these laws include the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Test Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Similar national and local regulations govern our facilities in Sweden and the Czech Republic. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge or injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, these hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.\nAlthough we have general liability insurance, these policies contain exclusions from insurance against claims arising from pollution from chemicals or pollution from conditions arising from our operations. Our collaborators are working with these types of hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations. In the event of a lawsuit or investigation, we could be held responsible for any injury we or our collaborators cause to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, any hazardous materials. However, we believe that we are currently in compliance with all material applicable environmental and occupational health and safety regulations.\nFor our product candidates, we will be subject to additional healthcare laws and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWithin the U.S. (and within foreign countries), if we obtain approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing them, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our arrangements with third-party payors and customers, subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal and state governments (or the regulatory bodies or governments of foreign countries), which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute our products. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. The applicable U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations (which may be comparable to foreign laws existing in foreign countries) that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing and promotion and prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products for unapproved uses;\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce the referral for an item or service or\nthe purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims; the FCA also permits a private individual acting as whistleblower to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;\n\u2022federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the DHHS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals;\n\u2022the federal law known as HIPAA, which, in addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n\u2022state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state gift ban and transparency laws, many of which state laws differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u2022state laws restricting interactions with healthcare providers and other members of the healthcare community or requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to implement certain compliance standards.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to, on a corporate or individual basis, penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and even imprisonment, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. In addition, the cost of implementing sufficient systems, controls, and processes to ensure compliance with all of the aforementioned laws could be significant. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of the company\u2019s business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including\nexclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect business in an adverse way.\nIt is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions, our business may be impaired.\nWe are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, and other similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, as well as various trade laws and regulations (including economic sanctions, export laws, and customs laws), and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from corruptly providing any payments or other benefits to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Securities & Exchange Commission, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of the FCPA, economic sanctions laws, export control laws, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. In addition, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, or the Bribery Act, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. An organization that fails to prevent bribery by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the Bribery Act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery.\nSimilarly, U.S. and similar worldwide trade laws, including economic sanctions, export laws, and customs laws, regulate our ability to conduct business with certain jurisdictions and counterparties, and regulate the ways in which we may export and import products around the world. In connection with these laws, various government agencies may require us to obtain export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in or with countries, entities, and individuals targeted with sanctions. The breadth and dynamic nature of these laws and regulations may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions.\nNovavax has received a number of regulatory approvals in ex-U.S. jurisdictions and has commenced commercial operations in these international locations. Further, a portion of our business with respect to our manufacturing is conducted outside of the United States. We expect our international activities to increase in the future. Though we maintain policies, internal controls and other measures reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable anti-corruption and trade laws and regulations, our employees or agents may nevertheless engage in improper conduct for which we might be held responsible. Any violations of these anti-corruption or trade laws, or even allegations of such violations, can lead to an investigation and/or enforcement action, which could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, and lead to significant costs and expenses, including legal fees. If we, or our employees or agents acting on our behalf, are found to have engaged in practices that violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal and civil enforcement action, suffer severe fines and penalties, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation, bans on transacting government business, delisting from securities exchanges and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our reputation, our revenue or our stock price could be adversely affected if we become the subject of any negative publicity related to actual or potential violations of anti-corruption or trade laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.\nOur success in large part depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and other trade secrets. To do so, we must prosecute and maintain existing patents, obtain new patents and pursue trade secret and other intellectual property protection. We also must operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third-parties or allowing third-parties to infringe our rights. We currently have or have rights to over 550 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering our technologies. However, patent issues relating to pharmaceuticals and biologics involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. To date, no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of biotechnology\npatent claims that are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) or enforced by the federal courts. Therefore, we do not know whether any particular patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, or that any patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot be sure that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable. Furthermore, there is a risk that others will independently develop or duplicate similar technology or products or circumvent the patents issued to us.\nAlthough our patent filings include claims covering various features of our vaccine candidates, including composition, methods of manufacture and use, our patents do not provide us with complete protection against the development of competing products. Some of our know-how and technology is not patentable. To protect our proprietary rights in unpatentable intellectual property and trade secrets, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information.\nFailure to obtain trademark registrations for proposed product names/brands, in the U.S. or abroad, may adversely impact our business.\nTrademark registration to protect the trademarks for our proposed products will require approval from the USPTO in the United States and in trademark offices throughout the world in our key markets. The USPTO or a trademark office in a key international jurisdiction may refuse registration of any of our trademarks on a variety of potential grounds. If registration is not granted to one of our trademarks in the United States or in another key international jurisdiction, we may be required to adopt an alternative name for that proposed product. If we adopt an alternative name, we would lose the benefit of any existing trademark applications for such developmental candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nThird parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities, including any vaccine candidates resulting from these activities, may be found to infringe patents or trademarks owned by third-parties and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights. There may be rights we are not aware of, including applications that have been filed, but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third-parties could bring claims against us, and that may cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent or trademark infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or biologic drug candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent or trademark infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be non- exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent or trademark infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. All of the issues described above could also impact our collaborators, which would also impact the success of the collaboration and therefore us.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent, trademark, and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\nWe may become involved in litigation to defend or enforce our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our collaborators or licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors. As a result, we may be required to file patent infringement suits to prevent unauthorized uses. This can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at the risk of not issuing. Competitors may infringe our trademarks or the trademarks of collaborators or licensors. As a result, we may be required to file suit to counter infringement for unauthorized use of an identical or confusingly similar trademark. This can be expensive and time-consuming.\nEven if we are successful, litigation may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management. Even with a broad portfolio, we may not be able, alone or with our collaborators and licensors, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the U.S.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nThe scope, validity, and ownership of our patent claims may be challenged in various venues and, if we do not prevail, our ability to exclude competitors may be harmed, potentially reducing our ability to succeed commercially.\nWe may be subject to a variety of challenges from third parties that relate to the scope of the claims or to their validity. Such challenges can be mounted in post-grant review, ex parte re-examination, and inter partes review proceedings before the USPTO, or similar adversarial proceedings in other jurisdictions. If we are unsuccessful in any such challenge, the scope of our claims could be narrowed or could be invalidated. Any such outcome could impair our ability to exclude competitors from the market in those countries, potentially impacting our commercial success.\nOur patents may be subject to various challenges related to ownership and inventorship, including interference or derivation proceedings. Third parties may assert that they are inventors on our patents or that they are owners of the patents. While we perform inventorship analyses to insure that the correct inventors are listed on our patents, we cannot be certain that a court of competent jurisdiction would arrive at the same conclusions we do. If we are unsuccessful in defending against ownership or inventorship challenges, a court may require us to list additional inventors, may invalidate the patent, or may transfer ownership of the patent to a third party. Any of these outcomes may harm our ability to exclude competitors and potentially impact our commercial success. Further, if ownership is transferred to a third party we may be required to seek a license to those rights to preserve our exclusive ability to practice the invention. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain a license, we may be required to expend time, effort, and other resources to design around the patent. Any such license may be non-exclusive and if a competitor is able to obtain a license from the third party, our ability to exclude that competitor from the market may be negatively impacted.\nEven if we are ultimately successful, defending any such challenges may cause us to incur substantial expenses and may require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business.\nThe scope, validity, and ownership of our trademark rights/registrations may be challenged in various venues in the U.S. and abroad and, if we do not prevail, our ability to exclude competitors from using and registering confusingly similar trademarks may be harmed, potentially reducing our ability to succeed commercially.\nWe may be subject to a variety of challenges from third parties that relate to the validity of our trademark registrations in the U.S. and internationally. Such challenges can be mounted in trademark cancellation and opposition proceedings before the USPTO, or similar adversarial proceedings in other jurisdictions. If we are unsuccessful in any such challenge, our trademark registrations could be narrowed or could be refused or canceled. Any such outcome could impair our ability to exclude competitors from using a confusingly similar mark, potentially impacting our commercial success.\nOur trademark registrations may be subject to various challenges related to likelihood of confusion, use of a trademark in commerce, or other grounds in the U.S. and internationally. Third parties may assert that our trademarks infringe on their prior rights or that we are not using a trademark in a particular jurisdiction in connection with the goods/services identified in the trademark registration. While we perform trademark clearance searches and analysis to determine that we are not infringing upon the trademark rights of others, we cannot be certain that a court of competent jurisdiction would arrive at the same conclusions we do. If we are unsuccessful in defending against such challenges, a court may cancel our trademark registration and/or issue an injunction requiring that we cease use of the trademark. We may also not be able to rely on common law rights that we may have in any trademark. Any of these outcomes may potentially impact our commercial success.\nEven if we are ultimately successful, defending any such challenges may cause us to incur substantial expenses and may require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties and, if our right to use the intellectual property we license is affected, our ability to develop and commercialize our vaccine candidates may be harmed.\nWe have in the past, and we expect in the future to license intellectual property from third parties and that these licenses will be material to our business. We will not own the patents or patent applications that underlie these licenses, and we may not control either the prosecution or the enforcement of the patents. Under such circumstances, we may be forced to rely upon our licensors to properly prosecute and file those patent applications and prevent infringement of those patents.\nWhile many of the licenses under which we have rights provide us with rights in specified fields, the scope of our rights under these and other licenses may be subject to dispute by our licensors or third parties. In addition, our rights to use these technologies and practice the inventions claimed in the licensed patents and patent applications are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not terminating them. Any of our licenses may be terminated by the licensor if we are in breach of a term or condition of the license agreement, or in certain other circumstances.\nFurther, any disputes regarding obligations in licenses may require us to take expensive and time-consuming legal action to resolve, and, even if we are successful, may delay our ability to commercialize products and generate revenue. Further, if we are unable to resolve license issues that arise we may lose rights to practice intellectual property that is required to make, use, or sell products. Any such loss could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for current or future product candidates and/or may require additional effort and expense to design around.\nOur vaccine candidates and potential vaccine candidates will require several components that may each be the subject of a license agreement. The cumulative license fees and royalties for these components may make the commercialization of these vaccine candidates uneconomical.\nIf patent laws or the interpretation of patent laws change, our competitors may be able to develop and commercialize our discoveries.\nImportant legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biopharmaceutical products and processes in the U.S. and other important markets outside the U.S., such as Europe and Japan. In addition, foreign markets may not provide the same level of patent protection as provided under the U.S. patent system. Litigation or administrative proceedings may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of certain of our and others\u2019 proprietary rights. Any such litigation or proceeding may result in a significant commitment of resources in the future and could force us to do one or more of the following: cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue; obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and redesign our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may be time-consuming or impossible to do. In addition, changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may result in patent laws that allow others to use our discoveries or develop and commercialize our products. We cannot provide assurance that the patents we obtain or the unpatented technology we hold will afford us significant commercial protection.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension and/or patent term adjustment in the United States under the Hatch- Waxman Act and similar extensions in foreign countries, our ability to exclude competitors may be harmed.\nIn the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Extensions of patent term may be available under certain circumstances. Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, we may be able to extend the term of one patent that covers a marketed product under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, (the \u201cHatch-Waxman Amendments\u201d) and similar legislation in the European Union.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. We may not receive any extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner.\nPatent term covering our products may also be extended for time spent during the prosecution of the patent application in the USPTO. This extension is referred to as Patent Term Adjustment (\u201cPTA\u201d). The laws and regulations\ngoverning how the USPTO calculates the PTA is subject to change and changes in the law can reduce or increase any such PTA. Further, the PTA granted by the USPTO may be challenged by a third party. If we do not prevail under such a challenge, the PTA may be reduced or eliminated, shortening the patent term, which may negatively impact our ability to exclude competitors.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Growth and Information Technology\nOur business may be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our business development initiatives.\nWe anticipate growing through both internal development projects, as well as external opportunities, which include the acquisition, partnering and in-licensing of products, technologies and companies or the entry into strategic alliances and collaborations. The availability of high quality opportunities is limited, and we may fail to identify candidates that we and our stockholders consider suitable or complete transactions on terms that prove advantageous. In order to pursue such opportunities, we may require significant additional financing, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to successfully identify and complete acquisitions, like our business combinations with Novavax CZ (formerly Praha Vaccines) and Novavax AB, strategic transactions involve many risks, including, among others, those related to diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, unanticipated expenses and liabilities, and increased complexity of our operations, which could prevent us from effectively exploiting acquired facilities, successfully integrating the acquired business and personnel, or fully realizing expected synergies.\nTo effectively manage our current and future potential growth, we will need to continue to enhance our operational, financial and management processes and to effectively expand, train and manage our employee base. Supporting our growth initiatives will require significant expenditures and management resources, including investments in research and development, manufacturing in-house and through third-party manufacturers and other areas of our business. If we do not successfully manage our growth and do not successfully execute our growth initiatives, then our business and financial results may be adversely impacted, and we may incur asset impairment or restructuring charges.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems or those of the vendors on whom we rely could compromise our information and expose us to liability, reputational damage, or other costs.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and many of our current and future strategic partners, vendors, contractors, and consultants collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and data about our clinical participants, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information represents an attractive target of criminal attack by malicious third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including nation-states, organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d patient groups, disgruntled current or former employees and others. Our ongoing operating activities also depend on functioning information technology systems. Cyber attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and, despite our security measures, our information technology systems and infrastructure and those of our vendors and partners are not immune to such attacks or breaches. In 2020, several domestic and foreign security agencies announced that government actors or government-affiliated actors were specifically targeting organizations engaging in COVID-19 vaccine development and research. Our profile as an OWS recipient and our development of NVX-CoV2373 may result in greater risk of cyber attack. Any such attack could result in a material compromise of our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, rendered, permanently or temporarily, inaccessible. Furthermore, we may not promptly discover a system intrusion. Like other companies in our industry, we have and third parties with connections to our systems or with data relevant to our business have experienced attacks to our data and systems, including malware and computer viruses. Additionally, we partner with sites that store our clinical trial data. Attacks could have a material impact on our business, operations or financial results. Any access, disclosure or other loss of information, whether stored by us or our partners, or other cyberattack causing disruption to our business, including ransomware, could result in reputational, business, and competitive harms, significant costs related to remediation and strengthening our cyber defenses, legal claims or proceedings, government investigations, liability including under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and increased insurance premium, all of which could adversely affect our business. We also may need to pay a ransom if a \u201cransomware\u201d infection prevents access or use of our systems and we may face reputational and other harms in addition to the cost of the ransom if an attacker steals certain critical data in the course of such an attack.\nCompliance with global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data globally, and our failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nEvolving state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and industry standards regarding privacy and security apply to our collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements, which increases the costs incurred by us in complying with such laws, which may be substantial. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, imposes a broad array of requirements for processing personal data, including elevated disclosure requirements regarding collection and use of such data, requirements that companies allow individuals to obtain copies or demand deletion of personal data held by those companies, limitations on retention of information, and public disclosure of significant data breaches, among other things. The GDPR provides for substantial penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year. From January 1, 2021 the GDPR has been retained in U.K., as it forms part of the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/419) (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d), alongside the U.K.\u2019s Data Protection Act 2018. Our efforts to comply with GDPR, the UK GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we are exposed to substantial penalties or litigation related to violations of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations.\nFurthermore, the GDPR and UK GDPR impose strict restrictions surrounding the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA and the U.K., including to the United States. In 2016, the EU and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called the EU-US Privacy Shield. On July 16, 2020, however, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision that declared the Privacy Shield framework invalid and raised questions about whether the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d), an alternative to the Privacy Shield, can lawfully be used for cross-border data transfers. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission adopted new SCCs under the GDPR for personal data transfers outside of the EEA. Under this legal mechanism, we may have obligations to conduct transfer impact assessments for such cross-border data transfers and implement additional security measures. As we incorporate the new SCCs into our contractual arrangements, we may be required to expend significant resources to update our contractual arrangements and to comply with the new obligations. If we are unable to implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border personal information transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe to the United States. An inability to import personal information from Europe to the United States may significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to conduct clinical trials in Europe\u037e limiting our ability to collaborate with contract research organizations, service providers, contractors and other companies subject to the GDPR; or requiring us to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense.\nPrivacy laws and regulations are also expanding in the United States. The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective January 1, 2020, substantially expands privacy obligations of many businesses, requiring new disclosures to California consumers, imposing new rules for collecting or using information about minors and affording consumers new abilities, such as the right to know whether their data is sold or disclosed and to whom, the right to request that a company delete their personal information, the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information and the right to non-discrimination in terms of price or service when a consumer exercises a privacy right. Like the GDPR, the CCPA establishes potentially significant penalties for violation. The CCPA also provides a private right of action along with statutory damages for certain data breaches, which is expected to increase risks related to data breach litigation. The California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which will become operational in 2023, expands on the CCPA, creating new consumer rights and protections, including the right to correct personal information, the right to opt out of the use of personal information in automated decision making, the right to opt out of \u201csharing\u201d consumer\u2019s personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising, and the right to restrict use of and disclosure of sensitive personal information, including geolocation data to third parties. Similar restrictions are also included in the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (\u201cVCDPA\u201d) and the Colorado Privacy Act (\u201cCPA\u201d), the first comprehensive state privacy statutes to follow the CCPA. We will need to evaluate and potentially update our privacy program to seek to comply with the CPRA, VCDPA, CPA and other US privacy laws, and we expect to incur additional expense in our effort to comply.\nThere is also a likelihood that other states will follow California, Colorado and Virginia in enacting more comprehensive privacy laws. Such legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, and may require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies, reduce the availability of previously useful data and result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.\nCollaborations and contracts of our wholly owned subsidiaries Novavax AB and Novavax CZ, with regional partners, such as SIIPL, Takeda and SK bioscience, as well as with international providers, expose us to additional risks associated with doing business outside the U.S.\nSwedish-based Novavax AB and Czech Republic-based Novavax CZ are wholly owned subsidiaries of Novavax, Inc. We also have entered into a supply and license agreement with SIIPL, collaboration and license agreements with each of Takeda and SK bioscience and other agreements and arrangements with foreign governments and companies in other countries. We plan to continue to enter into collaborations or partnerships with companies, non-profit organizations and local governments in various parts of the world. Risks of conducting business outside the U.S. include negative consequences of:\n\u2022the costs associated with seeking to comply with multiple regulatory requirements that govern our ability to develop, manufacture and sell products in local markets;\n\u2022failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022new or changes in interpretations of existing trade protections measures, including tariffs, embargoes and import and export licensing requirements;\n\u2022difficulties in and costs of staffing, managing and operating our international operations;\n\u2022changes in environmental, health and safety laws;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022new or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws;\n\u2022political instability and actual or anticipated military or potential conflicts (including, without limitation, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and a wider European or global conflict);\n\u2022economic instability, inflation, recession and interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022minimal or diminished protection of intellectual property in many jurisdictions; and\n\u2022possible nationalization and expropriation.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain key management or other personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on our senior executive officers, as well as key scientific and other personnel. The loss of these individuals could harm our business and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research, development or business objectives. Turnover in key executive positions resulting in lack of management continuity and long-term history with our Company could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs.\nWe may not be able to attract qualified individuals for key positions on terms acceptable to us. Competition for qualified employees is intense among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees could hinder our ability to complete clinical trials successfully and otherwise develop marketable products.\nWe also rely from time to time on outside advisors who assist us in formulating our research and development and clinical strategy. We may not be able to attract and retain these individuals on acceptable terms, which could delay our development efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes\nServicing our 3.75% convertible senior unsecured notes due 2023 requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow to pay our debt.\nIn 2016, we issued $325 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We do not expect our business to be able to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures and may therefore be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness, which is non-callable and matures in 2023, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. We cannot assure that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change repurchase price in cash with respect to any Notes surrendered by holders for repurchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions in our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes.\nCapped call transactions entered into in connection with our Notes may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with our Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the \u201ccapped call transactions\u201d) with certain financial institutions. The capped call transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, these financial institutions or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or to purchase our common stock. The financial institutions, or their respective affiliates, may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect the value of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nBecause our stock price has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile, the market price of our common stock may be lower or more volatile than expected.\nOur stock price has been highly volatile. From January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the closing sale price of our common stock has been as low as $112.98 per share and as high as $319.93 per share. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be lower or more volatile than expected.\nFurthermore, given the global focus on the COVID-19 pandemic and our investment in developing a COVID-19 vaccine, information in the public arena on this topic, whether or not accurate, has had and will likely continue to have an outsized impact (positive or negative) on our stock price. Information related to our development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization efforts with respect to NVX-CoV2373, or information regarding such efforts by competitors with respect to their COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine candidates, may meaningfully impact our stock price. As a result of this\nvolatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above your initial purchase price. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many other factors, including:\n\u2022future announcements about us or our collaborators or competitors, including the results of testing, technological innovations or new commercial products;\n\u2022clinical trial results;\n\u2022delays in making regulatory submissions;\n\u2022depletion of our cash reserves;\n\u2022sale of equity securities or issuance of additional debt;\n\u2022announcement by us of significant strategic partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, capital commitments or acquisitions;\n\u2022changes in government regulations;\n\u2022impact of competitor successes and in particular development success of vaccine candidates that compete with our own vaccine candidates;\n\u2022developments in our relationships with our collaboration and funding partners;\n\u2022announcements relating to health care reform and reimbursement levels for new vaccines and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of accuracy;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of our stock by us or existing stockholders (including stock by insiders or 5% stockholders);\n\u2022development, spread or new announcements related to pandemic diseases;\n\u2022litigation;\n\u2022public concern as to the safety of our products;\n\u2022significant set-backs or concerns with the industry or the market as a whole;\n\u2022regulatory inquiries, reviews and potential action, including from the FDA or the SEC;\n\u2022recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates; and\n\u2022the other factors described in this Risk Factors section.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation often has been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and prospects.\nRaising additional capital by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or vaccine candidates.\nIf we are unable to partner with a third-party to advance the development of one or more of our vaccine candidates, we will need to raise money through additional debt or equity financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience immediate dilution, which may be significant. There is also a risk that such equity issuances may cause an ownership change under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions, thus limiting our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and credits. To the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners, we may be required to relinquish, on terms that may not be favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or vaccine candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. In addition, economic conditions may also negatively affect the desire or ability of potential collaborators to enter into transactions with us. They may also have to delay or cancel research and development projects or reduce their overall budgets.\nProvisions of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law could delay or prevent the acquisition of the Company, even if such acquisition would be beneficial to stockholders, and could impede changes in our Board.\nProvisions in our organizational documents could hamper a third party\u2019s attempt to acquire, or discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire control of, the Company. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Our organizational documents also could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for our securities and make it more difficult to change the composition of our Board in any one year. For example, our organizational documents provide for a staggered board with three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms and advance notice requirements for stockholders to nominate directors and make proposals.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless advance board or stockholder approval was obtained.\nAny delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our earnings for use in the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock would be the only source of gain for stockholders until dividends are paid, if at all.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nLitigation or regulatory investigations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn addition to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we may be subject to other litigation or regulatory investigations. Regardless of the merits of any claims that may be brought against us, litigation or regulatory investigations could result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and we may be required to incur significant expenses defending against these claims. If we are unable to prevail in litigation or regulatory investigations, we could incur substantial liabilities. Where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that it is probable, we record a related liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate. However, because of uncertainties relating to litigation, the amount of our estimates could be wrong.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural or man-made disasters or public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur operations, and those of our clinical research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, vendors of materials needed in manufacturing, collaboration partners, distributors and other third parties upon whom we depend, could be subject to fires, extreme weather conditions, earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages,\nfloods, hurricanes, typhoons, war, political unrest, sabotage or terrorism and other natural or man-made disasters, as well as public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could prevent us from using all or a significant portion of our facilities and it may be difficult or impossible for us to continue certain activities for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event and we may incur substantial expenses and delays as a result. Our ability to manufacture our product candidates and obtain necessary clinical supplies for our product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of our contract manufacturing organizations or suppliers are affected by a natural or man-made disaster, or a public health emergency.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 may materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to present substantial global economic and public health challenges, which may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In response to COVID-19, various aspects of our business operations have been, and could continue to be, disrupted. We continue to implement a work from home policy, with our administrative employees working outside of our offices, and on-site staff restricted to only those required to execute certain laboratory and related support activities. Working remotely could increase our cybersecurity risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations. In addition, as a result of state or local restrictions, our on-site staff conducting research and development may not be able to access our laboratories, and these core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for extended periods of time. Travel restrictions and other governmental measures may also result in a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors and suppliers. If such third parties are unable to adequately satisfy their contractual commitments to us in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, while some jurisdictions have recently started to phase out restrictions imposed on commercial activities at varying degrees, a resurgence of COVID-19, coupled with a potential surge in variant strains of COVID-19, in certain geographies could result in restrictions being reinstated.\nOur clinical trials, whether planned or ongoing, may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Study procedures (particularly any procedures that may be deemed non-essential), site initiation, participant recruitment and enrollment, participant dosing, shipment of our product candidates, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring, site inspections and data analysis may be paused or delayed due to changes in hospital or research institution policies, federal, state or local regulations, prioritization of hospital and other medical resources toward efforts to treat or prevent COVID-19, or other reasons related to the pandemic. In addition, there could be a potential effect of COVID-19 to the operations of the FDA or other health authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals, including with respect to our product candidates. Any prolongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of our product candidates.\nThe trading prices for our common stock and that of other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as a result of investor concerns and uncertainty related to the impact of the outbreak on the economies of countries worldwide. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the emergence of variant strains, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the U.S. and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the U.S. and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union could result in increased regulatory and legal complexity, which may make it more difficult for us to do business in the UK and/or Europe and impose additional challenges in securing regulatory approval of our product candidates in the UK and/or Europe.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union as of January 31, 2020, with a transitional period up to December 31, 2020, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d, has caused political and economic uncertainty, including in the regulatory framework applicable to our operations and vaccine candidates in the United Kingdom and the European Union, and this uncertainty may persist for years. Brexit could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. As one of the Brexit consequences, the EMA has relocated from the United Kingdom to the Netherlands. This has led to a significant reduction of the EMA workforce, which has resulted and could further result in significant disruption and delays in its administrative procedures, such as granting clinical trial authorization or opinions for marketing authorization, disruption of importation and export of active substance and other\ncomponents of new drug formulations, and disruption of the supply chain for clinical trial product and final authorized formulations. As the European Union granted conditional marketing authorization for NVX-CoV2373 after January 1, 2021, it is not grandfathered in the UK. We therefore must seek to obtain a separate marketing authorization for the UK, increasing our regulatory burden.\nThe cumulative effects of the disruption to the regulatory framework may add considerably to the development lead time to marketing authorization and commercialization of products in the European Union and/or the United Kingdom. It is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, which can disrupt the timing of our clinical trials and regulatory approvals. In addition, changes in, and legal uncertainty with regard to, national and international laws and regulations may present difficulties for our clinical and regulatory strategy. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenues and achieve and sustain profitability.\nIn addition, as a result of Brexit, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the European Union. Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the absence of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have, how such withdrawal will affect us, and the full extent to which our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are increasingly a target for public scrutiny, and our business may be impacted by unfavorable publicity.\nGiven that COVID-19 represents an unprecedented urgent public health crisis, that we are developing NVX-CoV2373 as a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and that we have received significant funding from the U.S. and foreign governments and other sources to support the development and potential commercialization of NVX-CoV2373, we have observed and are likely to continue to face significant public attention and scrutiny over the complex decisions we have made and will be making regarding the development, testing, manufacturing, allocation and pricing of NVX-CoV2373. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face significant reputational harm, which could negatively affect our stock price. The intense public interest, including speculation by the media, in the development of NVX-CoV2373 has caused significant volatility in our stock price, which we expect to continue as data and other information from our ongoing clinical trials become publicly available. If concerns should arise about the actual or anticipated efficacy or safety of any of our product candidates, such concerns could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of these candidates, which could lead to a decline in investors\u2019 expectations and a decline in the price of our common stock.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges to our business.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about pharmaceutical companies\u2019 research, product candidates, and the diseases such product candidates are being developed to prevent. Social media practices in the pharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business, resulting in potential regulatory actions against us. For example, subjects may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical trial or to report an alleged adverse event. When such events occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend our business or the public\u2019s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our investigational product candidates. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social media or networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face regulatory actions, or incur reputational or other harm to our business.", "PERMNO": 82779, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NVAX"}
