RISK FACTORS\nKodak operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments which present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors it cannot control or predict. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d identifies the most significant factors which may adversely affect Kodak\u2019s business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with the MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. Additional risks and uncertainties Kodak is unaware of, or currently believes are not material, may also become important factors which could adversely affect its business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.\nRisks Related to Kodak\u2019s Business\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of its various credit facilities.\nA breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the Senior Secured First Lien Term Credit Agreement (the \u201cFirst Lien Term Credit Agreement\u201d), Senior Secured Second Lien Term Credit Agreement (the \u201cSecond Lien Term Credit Agreement\u201d, and together with the First Lien Term Credit Agreement, the \u201cTerm Credit Agreements\u201d) or the Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d) (and together with the Term Credit Agreements the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d) could result in an event of default under these facilities. If any event of default occurs and the Company is not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under each of these facilities, the administrative agent of each credit facility may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that\nfacility shall, declare all of its outstanding obligations under the applicable credit facility, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and the agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders shall, terminate the lenders\u2019 commitments under that facility and cease making further loans, and if applicable, each respective agent could institute foreclosure proceedings against the pledged assets. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and its ability to satisfy its obligations as they come due. Refer to \u201cRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets\u201d for additional risks associated with the Company\u2019s indebtedness.\nThe ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for Kodak to continue to operate its business.\nWhile Kodak has significantly reduced its rate of negative operating cash flow over the past two years, it continues to generate net negative operating cash flow. Its business includes segments that it views as stable, as well as a declining segment, its Consumer and Film segment. However, Kodak\u2019s \u201cstable\u201d segments may not grow or continue to generate the same cash flow, and it expects that its Consumer and Film segment will continue to experience declining sales. Kodak may be unable to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future, which would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and financial position.\nContinued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments and servicing the Company\u2019s debt require a significant amount of cash and it may not be able to generate cash necessary to finance these activities, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.\nKodak\u2019s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay the principal of, or interest on its indebtedness, or to fund Kodak\u2019s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, restructuring actions and other general corporate requirements.\nKodak\u2019s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. There are no assurances:\n\u2022\nKodak\u2019s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;\n\u2022\nKodak will be able to generate expected levels of operational EBITDA;\n\u2022\nKodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed;\n\u2022\nthe Company will meet all the conditions associated with making borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nKodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of its business and restructuring plan;\n\u2022\nKodak will not have to expend cash defending litigations regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or\n\u2022\nFuture sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of its liquidity needs.\nIf Kodak cannot fund its liquidity needs, it will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company\u2019s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company\u2019s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in our ability to provide products and services, reduce the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. There are no assurances any of these actions could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or they would satisfy Kodak\u2019s liquidity needs. In addition, if it incurs additional debt, the risks associated with the Company\u2019s substantial leverage, including the risk it will be unable to service the Company\u2019s debt, generate cash flow sufficient to fund its liquidity needs, or maintain compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreements, could intensify.\nKodak has significantly restructured its business and implemented a new segment reporting structure. The restructured Kodak has been in effect for a limited period of time and there are no assurances Kodak will be able to successfully operate as a restructured business.\nKodak has focused its investments on imaging and printing for business, specifically, commercial inkjet, packaging and functional (Micro 3D) printing solutions, and enterprise services and solutions. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for it to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve its financial objectives. Additionally, its strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within its control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance it will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of its strategy, or its ability to successfully execute its strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If it is unsuccessful in growing Kodak\u2019s investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of its target customers, its financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIf Kodak is not able to successfully implement its strategic business plans, or experiences implementation delays in cost structure reduction, Kodak\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively affected.\nKodak continues to rationalize its workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with its business initiatives. There are no assurances such measures will prove to be successful or the cost savings or other results it achieves through these plans will be consistent with its expectations. As a result, its results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if restructuring plans are not effectively managed, it may experience lost customer sales, product delays, additional costs and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to its business and customer relationships. The business plans are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, it may be unsuccessful in executing its business plan or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact its financial results and liquidity. Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s business.\nKodak\u2019s inability to effectively complete and manage strategic transactions could adversely impact its business performance, including its financial results.\nAs part of Kodak\u2019s strategy, it may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs, investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further its business objectives. For example, Kodak is in talks with prospective buyers about offers to purchase its Prosper enterprise inkjet business. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, it must identify suitable buyers, sellers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. If it fails to identify and successfully complete transactions that further Kodak\u2019s strategic objectives, it may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, it may be at a competitive disadvantage or it may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on its revenue, gross margins and profitability. In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect its financial results.\nKodak may pursue acquisitions or combinations which could fail or present unanticipated problems for its business in the future, which would adversely affect its ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions or increase the price it would be required to pay.\nKodak may seek to enter into transactions which may include acquiring or combining with other businesses. It may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate acquired or combined operations with its operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond its control;\n\u2022\npotential lack of operating experience in new business or geographic areas;\n\u2022\nan increase in its expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s attention may be temporarily diverted; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility it may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect its ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect its ability to find transactions which fit its strategic objectives or increase the price it would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder its desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to its assets and operations.\nDue to the nature of the products it sells and Kodak\u2019s worldwide distribution, it is subject to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs which may adversely impact its results of operations and financial position.\nAs a result of Kodak\u2019s global operating and financing activities, it is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position. Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which it does business tend to be volatile and, at times, its sales can be negatively impacted across all of Kodak\u2019s segments depending upon the value\nof the U.S. dollar, the Euro and other major currencies. In addition, Kodak\u2019s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum based or other commodity based raw materials, the prices of which have been, and may continue to be, volatile. If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on its revenue and earnings.\nWeakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect Kodak\u2019s financial performance and liquidity.\nThe global economic environment may adversely affect sales of Kodak\u2019s products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing volatility. Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on its results of operations and liquidity. There is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in markets which have experienced some economic strength will continue in the future, or Kodak will succeed in expanding sales in these markets. In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in its customers\u2019 ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, and its liquidity, including its ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, Kodak\u2019s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect its ability to meet its anticipated cash needs, impair its liquidity or increase its costs of borrowing.\nIf Kodak is unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, its business, financial position and operating results may suffer.\nKodak generally sells its products in industries which are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, its products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer. Therefore, its future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon its ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The success of its new products and services will depend on several factors, including its ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify customer needs;\n\u2022\ninnovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications;\n\u2022\ncommercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nmanufacture and deliver its products in sufficient volumes and on time;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate its offerings from its competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022\nprice its products and services competitively;\n\u2022\nanticipate its competitors\u2019 development of new products, services or technological innovations;\n\u2022\nwork successfully alongside its partners; and\n\u2022\ncontrol product quality in its manufacturing processes.\nAs a result of these and other factors, products currently in development by Kodak may or may not be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all. If any of its key products cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, its operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, it cannot guarantee any investment made in developing products will be recouped, even if it is successful in commercializing those products, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and operating results.\nKodak may not be successful in commercializing technologies for micro 3D printing, one of its target markets, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial position.\nKodak is in the process of commercializing technologies for micro 3D printing, one of its target markets. It may not be successful in developing and marketing products in some or all of the areas it seeks to enter in micro 3D printing. Development, production, marketing or administrative costs may exceed expectations and operating cash flow generated from these products. Customers may favor other technologies or solutions, and its products may not be competitive on the basis of cost, functionality or other characteristics. In addition, its competitors may have better technologies to which it may not have access, and may have more financial or other resources to support development and marketing of their products. After advancing both silver and copper metal mesh technologies for touch screen sensors, Kodak has decided to focus on copper metal mesh development and will exit its position in silver metal mesh development. The investment required to develop products may exceed its expectations. If any or all of these risks occurred, it may not realize benefits associated with its investments in micro 3D printing, and it could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial position.\nIf Kodak\u2019s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent product reliability, yield and quality issues, its product launch plans may be delayed, its financial results may be adversely impacted, and its reputation may be harmed.\nIn developing, commercializing and manufacturing Kodak\u2019s products and services, it must adequately address reliability, yield and other quality issues, including defects in its engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in its products. Because Kodak\u2019s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although it has established internal procedures to minimize risks which may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance it will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair its relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect its brand image; product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation, and its reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect its business as well as its financial results.\nThe competitive pressures it faces could harm Kodak\u2019s revenue, gross margins, cash flow and market share.\nThe markets in which Kodak does business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than Kodak. In addition, it encounters aggressive price competition for many of its products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of its competitors may:\n\u2022\nforesee the course of market developments more accurately than it does;\n\u2022\nsell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services;\n\u2022\nhave the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost;\n\u2022\nhave better access to supplies and the ability to acquire supplies at a lower cost;\n\u2022\ndevelop stronger relationships with its suppliers or customers;\n\u2022\nadapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than it does; or\n\u2022\nhave access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than it can obtain.\nAs a result, Kodak may not be able to compete successfully with its competitors. Finally, it may not be able to maintain its operating costs or prices at levels which would allow it to compete effectively. Kodak\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If its products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, it could also lose market share, adversely affecting its revenue, gross margins and cash flow.\nAn inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak\u2019s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact its revenue, profitability and financial position.\nThe competitive environment in which Kodak operates may require it to facilitate or provide financing to its customers in order to win a contract. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for its products and services. It may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Its success may be dependent, in part, upon its ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on its customers\u2019 creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak\u2019s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for its products and services. If Kodak is unable to provide competitive financing solutions to its customers or if it extends credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, its revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.\nIf the U.K. Kodak Pension Plan Purchasing Parties (\u201cKPP Purchasing Parties\u201d) are not able to successfully operate the Personalized Imaging and Document Imaging Business (the \u201cPI/DI Business\u201d) acquired from Kodak or meet their commitments under supply, service and transition services and other agreements entered into with the Company, its brand, reputation and financial results could suffer.\nThe Amended and Restated Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement between Eastman Kodak Company, Qualex, Inc., Kodak (Near East), Inc., KPP Trustees Limited, as Trustee for the Kodak Pension Plan of the United Kingdom, and, solely for the purposes of Section 11.4, KPP Holdco Limited, dated August 30, 2013 (\u201cAmended SAPA\u201d) and certain related agreements permit the KPP Purchasing Parties to use the Kodak name and brand in its operation of the PI/DI Business on a going-forward basis. If the KPP Purchasing Parties are not successful in the operation of the PI/DI Business, Kodak\u2019s brand image and reputation as a producer of high quality products could be harmed, which could adversely affect its financial results or operations. In addition, in connection with the closing under the Amended SAPA, on the Effective Date, the Company entered into certain supply and transition services agreements with the KPP Purchasing Parties under which the KPP Purchasing Parties are purchasing supplies and services from Kodak. The inability of the KPP Purchasing Parties to make payments as they are due under the supply, service and transition service agreements could negatively affect Kodak\u2019s financial results.\nIf Kodak cannot attract, retain and motivate key management and other key employees, its revenue and earnings could be harmed.\nIn order for it to be successful, Kodak must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak\u2019s targeted growth markets, are critical to its future. It may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if it does not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect its business.\nIf Kodak cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer preferences, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nKodak serves imaging needs for business markets, including packaging, micro 3D printing, graphic communications and enterprise services. Its success in these markets depends on its ability to offer differentiated solutions and technologies to capture market share and grow scale. To enable this, it must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products it provides to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of its customers as the business models of its customers evolve. Its customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services its customers will demand. The success of Kodak\u2019s business depends in part on its ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If it does not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf Kodak is unable to timely anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to its current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate its businesses, products, and the markets it serves, its revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nThe success of Kodak\u2019s technology development efforts may be affected by the development efforts of its competitors, which may have more financial and other resources to better ascertain technology trends, changing customer preferences, and changing business expectations or models. Kodak\u2019s assessment and response may as a result be incomplete or inferior when compared to its competitors, which could adversely affect its product roadmaps and associated revenue streams.\nIf Kodak\u2019s investment in research and product development is inadequate, its response to changing customer needs and changing market dynamics may be too slow and this may adversely affect revenue streams from new products and services.\nKodak has outsourced a significant portion of its overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics and back office operations and faces the risks associated with reliance on third-party suppliers.\nKodak has outsourced a significant portion of its overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics, customer support and administrative operations to third parties. To the extent it relies on third-party service providers, it faces the risk those third parties may not be able to:\n\u2022\ndevelop manufacturing methods appropriate for Kodak\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nmaintain an adequate control environment;\n\u2022\nquickly respond to changes in customer demand for Kodak\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nobtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or\n\u2022\nmitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or disruptions.\nFurther, even if Kodak honors its payment and other obligations to its key suppliers of products, components and services, such suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services, or demand changes in payment terms. In addition, it may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at its suppliers, such as disruptions due to fires, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier\u2019s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of its suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from its suppliers, Kodak may be unable to meet its customer commitments, its costs could be higher than planned, and its cash flows and the reliability of its products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee it will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by its suppliers.\nOther supplier problems that Kodak could face include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the duration and termination of its contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to the ability to obtain products, components or services from single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks, should alternative third-party relationships not be established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs which might result in Kodak\u2019s inability to meet customer demand for its products, damage to its relationships with its customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm Kodak\u2019s future revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses.\nWorldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which Kodak is predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm its revenue and financial condition and increase its costs and expenses. In addition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to its operations or the operations of its suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. It has operations including research and development facilities in geographically disparate locations, such as Israel, Japan, China, Canada and Germany. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact its ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time. In addition, any telecommunications failure, cyber-attack or security breach could compromise Kodak\u2019s information technology systems and result in the loss of proprietary information or operating data, damage its reputation, or otherwise adversely impact its operations. These events could seriously harm Kodak\u2019s revenue and financial condition, and increase its costs and expenses. Additionally, as cyber threats continue to evolve, Kodak may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nImproper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm Kodak\u2019s reputation.\nKodak stores and processes personally-identifiable information of its employees and, in some case, its customers. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of the increasingly hostile information security environment. This environment demands Kodak continuously improve its design and coordination of security controls across its businesses and geographies. Despite these efforts, it is possible its security controls over personal data, its training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Improper disclosure of this information could harm its reputation or subject it to liability under laws which protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.\nIf Kodak cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which its business depends, or if third parties assert it violates their intellectual property rights, its revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.\nA key differentiator for Kodak in many of its businesses is its technological advantage over competitors\u2019 products and solutions. Its technological advantage is supported by Kodak\u2019s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak\u2019s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining, protecting and enforcing Kodak\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak\u2019s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, diluted, disclosed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Kodak may be unable to protect its proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect its competitive position. Also, much of Kodak\u2019s business and many of its products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties and, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, it may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from relevant third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nKodak also licenses third parties to use its trademarks. In an effort to preserve its trademark rights, Kodak enters into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of its trademarks, and which require its licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services they provide under the trademarks. Although Kodak makes efforts to police the use of its trademarks by its licensees, there can be no assurance these efforts will be sufficient to ensure the licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event Kodak\u2019s licensees fail to do so, its trademark rights could be diluted. Because the laws and enforcement regimes of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States, in certain jurisdictions Kodak may be unable to adequately prevent such unauthorized uses, which could result in impairment of its trademark rights.\nKodak has made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and has filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect its intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of its licensees. There can be no assurance Kodak\u2019s patent applications will be approved, any patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide it with meaningful protection, or such patents will not be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, Kodak may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if it fails to timely file a patent application in any such country, it may be precluded from doing so at a later date. The patents issuing may vary in scope of coverage depending on the country in which such patents issue.\nIn addition, third parties may claim Kodak\u2019s customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by it are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit Kodak\u2019s access to certain markets. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like Kodak. Even if it believes the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on its business:\n\u2022\nclaims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nclaims of intellectual property infringement may require it to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting it from marketing or selling certain of its products;\n\u2022\neven if it has an agreement with a third party to indemnify it against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold such party\u2019s contractual obligations; and\n\u2022\nif it cannot or does not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, its revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nFinally, Kodak uses open source software in connection with its products and services. Companies which incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, Kodak could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what it believes to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost; any requirement to disclose Kodak\u2019s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to its business results of operations and financial condition.\nKodak\u2019s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.\nKodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of its U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in its financial statements, are affected by various factors subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak\u2019s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nIn past years, Kodak has experienced increases in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond its control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension plan assets and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. There can be no assurance it will succeed in limiting cost increases. In addition, continued upward pressure, including any as a result of new legislation, could reduce the profitability of its businesses.\nKodak may be required to recognize impairments in the value of its goodwill and/or other long-lived assets resulting from the application of fresh start accounting, which could adversely affect its results of operations.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, Kodak applied fresh start accounting pursuant to which the reorganization value was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets is reported as goodwill. In connection with fresh start, Kodak also fair valued its other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. The determination of reorganization value, equity value of the Company\u2019s common stock and fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent on various estimates and assumptions, including financial projections and the realization of certain events. Kodak tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Kodak evaluates other long-lived assets for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairments could occur in the future if Kodak\u2019s expected future cash flows decline, market or interest rate environments deteriorate, or if carrying values change materially compared with changes in their respective fair values.\nKodak\u2019s businesses experience seasonality of sales. Therefore, lower demand for Kodak\u2019s products or increases in costs during periods which are expected to be at peak in seasonality may have a pronounced negative effect on its results of operations.\nEquipment and consumables sales generally exhibit higher levels in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of placements, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices. As a result, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of Kodak\u2019s performance or how it will perform in the future. In addition, adverse developments during what are expected to be peak periods in seasonality, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for its products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of its key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and operating results. Tight credit markets which limit capital investments or a weak economy which decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales. These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on its business and results of operations.\nIf Kodak fails to manage distribution of its products and services properly, its revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nKodak uses a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver its products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels to various potential customer segments for its products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, Kodak\u2019s failure to achieve the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for its products and services could adversely affect its revenue, gross margins and earnings. This has concentrated Kodak\u2019s credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on its financial performance.\nKodak\u2019s future results could be harmed if it is unsuccessful in its efforts to expand sales in emerging markets.\nBecause Kodak is seeking to expand its sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, and specifically in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Kodak\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:\n\u2022\nsupport of multiple languages;\n\u2022\nrecruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products;\n\u2022\ncompliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for its products;\n\u2022\ncomplexity of managing international operations;\n\u2022\nexposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncommercial laws and business practices which may favor local competition;\n\u2022\nmultiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nlimitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash;\n\u2022\nlimitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncomplications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability.\nThere can be no assurance Kodak will be able to market and sell its products in all of its targeted markets. If its efforts are not successful, its business growth and results of operations could be harmed. As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.\nKodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nKodak is subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it conducts its business, including laws regarding the discharge of pollutants, including greenhouse gases, into the air and water, the need for environmental permits for certain operations, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of its products and the recycling and treatment and disposal of its products. If it does not comply with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the use and management of hazardous substances, or otherwise incurs liabilities under such laws which in some instances can impose liability without regard to fault, then it could incur liability and/or could be prohibited or limited in the operation of certain facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws, and costs associated with the cleanup of contaminated sites, could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York State Urban Development Corporation have entered into a settlement agreement concerning certain of the Company\u2019s historical environmental liabilities at Eastman Business Park through the establishment of a $49 million environmental remediation trust. Should historical liabilities exceed $49 million, New York State is responsible for payments of cost up to an additional $50 million. In the event the historical liabilities exceed $99 million, the Company will become liable for 50% of the portion above $99 million, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. The settlement agreement was implemented on May 20, 2014. The settlement agreement includes a covenant not to sue from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Any uncertainties related to the Company\u2019s environmental obligations may impact its ability to further develop and transform Eastman Business Park.\nKodak\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal matters.\nKodak has various contingencies which are not reflected on its balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved from time to time in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: commercial, customs, employment, and intellectual property matters, as well as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and other laws and regulations as discussed in the \u201cContingencies\u201d note in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in its determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d will require Kodak to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing Kodak\u2019s products.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Kodak has developed a framework and management system consistent with the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and is currently performing due diligence on its supply chain. It expects to incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in its products, in addition to the cost of any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, which may adversely affect its business. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide \u201cconflict-free\u201d minerals may be limited, which may make it difficult to satisfy customers who require all of the components of its products be certified as conflict-free, which could place it at a competitive disadvantage if it is unable to do so. Because Kodak\u2019s supply chain is complex, it may also not be sufficiently able to verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in its products through the due diligence procedures it implements, which may harm its reputation.\nKodak has determined certain of its products contain such specified minerals, and it has developed a process to identify where such minerals originated. It filed its Conflict Minerals Disclosure report on June 1, 2015. As of the date of its conflict minerals report for the 2014 calendar year, it was unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or adjoining country.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets\nThe combination of the stricter covenant requirements in the First Lien Term Credit Agreement and Second Lien Term Credit Agreement, Kodak\u2019s on-going investment in growth businesses, and softening and volatility of global economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, could make it difficult for the Company to satisfy the leverage covenants under the Term Credit Agreements on an on-going basis.\nThe Company is obligated to comply with a number of financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Agreements. Kodak intends to conduct its operations in a manner which will result in continued compliance with the secured leverage ratio covenants under the Term Credit Agreements; however, compliance for future quarters may depend on Kodak undertaking one or more non-operational transactions, such as a monetization of assets, a debt refinancing, the raising of equity capital, or a similar transaction. If the Company is unable to remain in compliance and does not make alternate arrangements with its term lenders, an event of default would occur under the Credit Agreements which, among other remedies, would entitle the lenders or their agents to declare the outstanding obligations under the Term Credit Agreements to be immediately due and payable. Refer to \u201cRisks Related to Kodak\u2019s Business risk factor-There can be no assurance the Company will be able to comply with the terms of its various credit facilities\u201d for a description of additional risks relating to compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreements.\nThe availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Agreement is limited by the amount of various types of assets and, under certain circumstances, the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement will have greater control over Kodak\u2019s cash.\nAvailability under the Company\u2019s ABL Credit Agreement is based on the amount of Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Machinery and Equipment, Eligible Cash and Qualified Cash less specified reserves as described in \u201cNote 8: Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference into this report. Kodak\u2019s U.S. Accounts Receivable and Inventory levels have declined over the past two years, and Machinery and Equipment for purposes of the ABL Credit Agreement amortizes down by $1 million per quarter. If Eligible Receivables, Eligible Inventory and Eligible Machinery and Equipment continue to decline and an asset base cannot be maintained to support the $118 million of outstanding letters of credit and the $30 million of Excess Availability required under the ABL Credit Agreement, the Company would be required to increase restricted cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account or remain in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement\u2019s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and operate under cash dominion by the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement. Additional cash deposited in the Eligible Cash account would be classified as restricted cash, would not be available to support ongoing working capital and investment needs and could not be used in determining the Net Secured Leverage Ratio under the Term Loan Agreements. If the administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement executed cash dominion, it would increase operational complexities for the Company. An event of default would occur if neither of these alternatives were achieved.\nThe Company\u2019s substantial monetary obligations require a portion of its cash flow be used to pay interest and fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and its other obligations could have important negative consequences to the Company and investors in its securities. These include the following:\n\u2022\nit may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations, including, but not limited to, its obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt it may have incurred;\n\u2022\nit could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, refinancing or other purposes;\n\u2022\nit will have to use a significant part of its cash flow or cash balances to make payments on its debt and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and\n\u2022\nadverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact on it.\nThe Company cannot be sure cash generated from its business will be as high as it expects or its expenses will not be higher than it expects. Because a portion of its expenses are fixed in any given year, its operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from its business or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with its debt obligations, could adversely affect its ability to fund its operations.\nKodak\u2019s access to the capital markets may be limited.\nBecause of the emergence from bankruptcy in 2013, Kodak\u2019s current non-investment grade credit rating, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, its access to the capital markets may be limited. Moreover, the urgency of a capital-raising transaction may require it to pursue additional capital at an inopportune time. Kodak\u2019s ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ncovenants in the Credit Agreements;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in Kodak and the markets in which it operates;\n\u2022\nits financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nits levels of debt;\n\u2022\nits ability to generate positive cash flow;\n\u2022\nits requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements;\n\u2022\nits credit ratings;\n\u2022\nits cash flow;\n\u2022\nits long-term business prospects; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions, including the timing and magnitude of any market recovery.\nKodak may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit its ability to meet its operating needs and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe current non-investment grade status may adversely impact Kodak\u2019s commercial operations, increase its liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. It may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and there are no assurances its credit ratings will improve, or they will not decline, in the future. Its credit ratings may affect the evaluation of its creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put it at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings.\nIn carrying out its commercial business strategy, the current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that Kodak either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support its business. Additionally, the current non-investment grade credit ratings may limit its ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity, refinance its debt obligations or access the capital markets at the lower borrowing costs which would presumably be available to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. Should its ratings continue at their current levels, or should its ratings be further downgraded, it would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.", "PERMNO": 14276, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "KODK"}
