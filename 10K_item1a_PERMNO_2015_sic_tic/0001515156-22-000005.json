{"cik": "1515156", "company": "Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risks relate to us as of the date this Report is filed with the SEC. This list of risks is not intended to be exhaustive, but reflects what we believe are the material risks inherent in our business and the ownership of our securities as of the specified dates. A statement to the effect that the occurrence of a specified event may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, profitability, financial condition, or the like, is intended to reflect the fact that such an event, if it occurs, would be likely to have a negative impact on your investment in ADES, but should not imply the likelihood of the occurrence of such specified event. The order in which the following risk factors are presented is not intended as an indication of the relative seriousness of any given risk.\nRisks related to our business\nAs of December 31, 2021, earnings in our RC segment have substantially ended and beginning in 2022, we will be solely dependent on earnings from our APT segment to fund our operations. We will need to grow the earnings from our APT segment substantially to make up for the loss of earnings of our RC segment.\nThe Section 45 tax credit period expired on December 31, 2021. As a result, both Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services have substantially ceased operations and we expect to receive limited, final distributions from each during the first half of 2022. Substantially all of our earnings and cash flows in 2021 and 2020 were comprised of equity method earnings from Tinuum Group and M-45 Royalties generated from certain of Tinuum Group\u2019s invested RC facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our RC segment generated segment operating income of $82.6 million.\nFrom an earnings standpoint, our APT segment must grow substantially, either organically or through acquisition, in order to replace earnings from our RC segment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our APT segment earnings during 2022 or beyond to cover our current operating expenses or to provide a return to shareholders that is comparable to the return that we previously provided while our RC segment was operating. We do not expect our overall selling, general and administrative portions of our operating expenses to materially decrease in 2022 as a result of the wind down of our RC segment. If we are not able to cover operating expenses, we could be forced to raise additional capital, significantly reduce our operating expenses or take other alternative actions.\nThe financial effects of Tinuum Group providing indemnification under performance guarantees of its RC facilities are largely unknown and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nTinuum Group indemnifies certain utilities and lessees of RC facilities for particular risks associated with the operations and tax treatment of those facilities. We have provided limited, joint and several guarantees of Tinuum Group\u2019s obligations under those leases. Any substantial payments made under such guarantees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are reviewing strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any strategic transaction, that any such strategic transaction will result in additional value for our stockholders or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe have announced that our board of directors has initiated a strategic review to assess a range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. No timetable has been set for completion of this process, and there can be no assurance that the review of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. The process of reviewing strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and, if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have and will continue to incur substantial expenses associated with identifying, evaluating and negotiating potential strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock. Until the review process is concluded, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and volatility in the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nOur inability to meet customer supply requirements due to damage to or insufficient production capacity of our Red River manufacturing facility may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe own and operate a single activation-based manufacturing plant, which is our sole manufacturing plant for producing and selling products to our customers. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve our\nobjectives for operating efficiencies depends on the full-time operation of the Red River Plant. We cannot replicate our manufacturing methods at another plant due to the limited availability of similar manufacturing plants, the additional costs incurred in supplying raw materials such as lignite to another plant, and the risk of revealing our confidential and proprietary technologies and manufacturing processes.\nIf the Red River Plant was destroyed or damaged in a significant manner, we would suffer a loss of inventory to supply customers, likely incur additional costs to deliver products to our customers, and disrupt the ordinary course of our business. In addition, if contractual demand exceeds manufacturing capacity, we would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under our contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales, profitability, contract penalties or terminations and damage to our customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have insured the Red River Plant against damage or destruction as well as for losses from business interruptions, there can be no assurance that any insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any such losses.\nFurther, a prolonged disruption in our operations due to Red River Plant downtime or having to meet customer requirements that exceed its maximum manufacturing capacity would require us to seek alternative customer supply arrangements, which may not be on attractive terms to us or could lead to delays in distribution of products to our customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernmental regulations requiring mandatory COVID-19 vaccination of employees could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14042 (the \"Executive Order\") requiring all employers with U.S. Government contracts to ensure that their U.S.-based employees, contractors, and subcontractors that work on or in support of U.S. Government contracts are fully vaccinated by December 8, 2021. The executive order includes on-site and remote U.S.-based employees, contractors and subcontractors and it only permits limited exemptions for medical and religious reasons. The Executive Order is facing legal challenges and currently is enjoined nationwide.\nRemoval of the injunction of the Executive Order or additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which our business operates. Our implementation of these required policies may result in employee attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to affect and pose risks to our business and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant volatility in the general economy. International, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities have taken extraordinary actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, including travel bans, quarantines, \"stay-at-home\" orders and similar mandates that caused many individuals to substantially restrict their daily activities and many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. While certain governments eased restrictions during the balance of 2020 and 2021, the pandemic remains disruptive to our business operations.\nWe may not be able to operate at optimal levels of efficiency given new work rules and procedures that were or will be implemented to protect our employees, as well as potential increased absenteeism as a result of community spread of COVID-19. Any suspension of production at our manufacturing facility, or difficulties or inefficiencies in resuming or increasing production, is likely to adversely impact our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and that impact may be material. Furthermore, COVID-19 and related supply chain disruptions have impacted and may further impact our ability to efficiently operate and may lead to production delays or increased costs of production.\nWhile we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to continued uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures, our compliance with these measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could continue to affect our business and operations, as well as that of our key customers, suppliers and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. The disruptions to our operations caused by COVID-19 have resulted and are expected to continue to result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our manufacturing, sales, marketing, and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements.\nThe situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments, some of which are beyond our knowledge or control. These include the duration and scope of the pandemic, travel restrictions, government mandated\nrestrictions and regulations, business and workforce disruptions, the impact on demand for our products, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease, including the efficacy of and ability to widely distribute vaccinations and therapeutics, and whether the pandemic leads to recessionary conditions in any of our key markets. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 to our business.\nDemand for our products and services depends significantly on environmental laws and regulations. Uncertainty as to the future of such laws and regulations, changes to such laws and regulations or granting of extensions of compliance deadlines has had, and will likely continue to have, a material effect on our business.\nA significant market driver for our existing products and services and those planned in the future are present and expected environmental laws and regulations, particularly those addressing the reduction of mercury and other emissions from coal-fired electricity generating units. If such laws and regulations are delayed, or are not enacted or are repealed or amended to be less strict, or include prolonged phase-in periods, or are not enforced, our business would be adversely affected by declining demand for such products and services. For example:\na.The implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permitting requirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the EPA has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition and will likely continue to do so.\nb.To the extent federal, state and local legislation mandating that electric power generating companies serving a state or region purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal, and such amount lessens demand for electricity from coal-fired plants, the demand for our products and services would likely decrease.\nFederal, state and international laws or regulations addressing emissions from coal-fired electricity generating units, climate change or other actions to limit emissions, including public opposition to new coal-fired electricity generating units, has caused and could continue to cause electricity generators to transition from coal to other fuel and power sources, such as natural gas, nuclear, wind, hydroelectric and solar. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations or public pressure will depend upon the degree to which electricity generators diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the periods over which those laws or regulations are or will be phased in, the amount of public opposition and the state and cost of commercial development of related technologies and processes. In addition, Public Utility Commissions (\"PUCs\") may not allow utilities to charge consumers for, and pass on the cost of, emissions control technologies without federal or state mandates. We cannot reasonably predict the impact that any such future laws or regulations or public opposition may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAction by the EPA related to MATS that decreases demand for our mercury removal products could have a material adverse effect on our APT segment.\nPerformance in our APT segment is largely dependent upon demand for mercury removal-related product, which is largely affected by the amount of coal-based power generation used in the U.S. and the continued regulation of utilities under MATS. In May 2020, the EPA reconsidered and withdrew its 2016 \"supplemental finding\" associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule. In this action, the EPA found that it was not \"appropriate and necessary\" to regulate HAP emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs. However, the EPA expressly stated that the reconsideration neither removed coal- and oil-fired EGUs from the list of sources that must comply with the MATS rule, nor rescinded the MATS Rule, which has remained continuously in effect. On February 9, 2022, the EPA published a new proposed rule revoking the May 2020 withdrawal of the 2016 supplemental finding and affirming that it is \"appropriate and necessary\" to regulate HAP emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs. Any final action taken by the EPA related to MATS that decreases demand for our products for mercury removal will have a negative effect on the financial results of our APT segment. The timing and content of the final reconsideration rule are unknown.\nUncertain geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our business.\nUncertain geopolitical conditions, including the invasion of Ukraine, sanctions against Russia and other potential impacts on this region's economic environment and currencies may cause disruptions in our business. These include logistics delays or shortages in producing and shipping certain of our raw materials, increases in energy prices that could increase costs of certain\nof our raw materials, increases in transportation costs from overall higher gasoline prices and cyber-attacks targeted at U.S. power infrastructure that could impact demand for our products.\nThe failure of tariffs placed on U.S. imports of Chinese activated carbon to adequately address the impact of low-priced imports from China could have a material adverse effect on the competitiveness and financial performance of our APT segment.\nOur APT segment faces competition in the U.S. from low-priced imports of activated carbon products. If the volumes of these low-priced imports increase, especially if they are sold at less than fair value, our sales of competing products could decline, which could have an adverse effect on the earnings of our APT segment. In addition, sales of these low-priced imports may negatively impact our pricing. To limit these activities, regulators in the U.S. have enacted an anti-dumping duty order on steam activated carbon products from China. In 2018, the order was extended for an additional five years. The amount of anti-dumping duties collected on imports of steam activated carbon from China is reviewed annually by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To the extent the anti-dumping margins do not adequately address the degree to which imports are unfairly traded, the anti-dumping order may be less effective in reducing the volume of these low-priced activated carbon imports in the U.S., which could negatively affect demand and/or pricing for our AC products.\nThe market for consumables and other products that provide pollutant reduction is highly competitive and some of our competitors are significantly larger and more established than we are, which could adversely impede our growth opportunities and financial results.\nWe operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a production cost advantage, competitive technological capabilities and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative products for existing and future customers. We may face increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by industry competitors or other companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products and could be substituted for our products, which may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, market competition could negatively impact our ability to maintain or raise prices or maintain or grow our market position.\nWe compete against certain significantly larger and/or more established companies in the market for consumables and other products that provide mercury emissions reduction, water treatment and air purification.\nReduction of coal consumption by North American electricity power generators could result in less demand for our products and services. If utilities significantly reduce the number of coal-fired electricity generating units or the amount of coal burned without a corresponding increase in the services required at the remaining units, this could reduce our revenues and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe amount of coal consumed for North American electricity power generation is affected by, among other things, (1) the location, availability, quality and price of alternative energy sources for power generation, such as natural gas, fuel oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, biomass and solar power; and (2) technological developments, including those related to competing alternative energy sources.\nNatural gas-fueled generation and renewable energy generation has been displacing and may continue to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators. We expect that a significant amount of the new power generation necessary to meet increasing demand for electricity generation will be fueled by these sources. The price of natural gas has remained relatively competitive for power generation and the use of natural gas is perceived as having a lower environmental impact than burning coal. Natural gas-fired plants are cheaper to construct, and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain, and ongoing costs of natural gas-fired plants associated with meeting environmental compliance are lower. Possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits, that enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make those sources more competitive than coal. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electricity power generators, whether as a result of new power plants utilizing alternative energy sources or as a result of technological advances, could reduce the demand for our current products and services, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, long-term changes in environmental regulation that threaten or preclude the use of coal or other fossil fuels as a primary fuel source for electricity production may result in the reduction or closure of a significant number of coal-fired electric generating units, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we derived approximately 50% of our total consumable revenues from our five largest customers. Our top three customers accounted for approximately 37% of our total consumable revenue for our last fiscal year. If any of our five largest customers were to significantly reduce the quantities of consumables they purchase from us, it may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVolatility in price and availability of raw materials can significantly impact our results of operations.\nThe manufacturing and processing of our consumable products requires significant amounts of raw materials. The price and availability of those raw materials can be impacted by factors beyond our control. Our consumable products, exclusive of lignite coal, use a variety of additives. Significant movements or volatility in the costs of additives could have an adverse effect on our working capital or results of operations. Additionally, we obtain certain raw materials from selected key suppliers. While we have inventory of such raw materials, if any of these suppliers are unable to meet their obligations with us on a timely basis or at an acceptable price, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials or be unable to obtain the materials.\nWe may attempt to offset the increase in raw material costs or challenges in the supply of raw materials with price increases allowed in our contractual relationships or through cost reduction efforts. If we are unable to fully offset the increased cost of raw materials through price increases, it could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face operational risks inherent in mining operations and our mining operations have the potential to cause safety issues, including those that could result in significant personal injury.\nWe own the Five Forks Mine, a lignite coal mine located in Louisiana, which is operated for us by a third party. Mining operations by their nature involve a high level of uncertainty and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. At the Five Forks Mine, the risks are primarily operational risks associated with the maintenance and operation of the heavy equipment required to dig and haul the lignite and risks relating to producing lower than expected lignite quality or recovery rates. The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, damage to mineral properties, production facilities or mining equipment, damage to the environment, delays in or reduced production and potential legal liabilities.\nWe also own the Marshall Mine, a former lignite coal mine located in Texas, which ceased mining operations in the third quarter of 2020 and is currently being reclaimed. Reclamation operations by their nature involve a high level of uncertainty and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. At the Marshall Mine, the current risks are primarily operational risks associated with the maintenance and operation of the heavy equipment. The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, equipment, damage to the environment, delays in reclamation and potential legal liabilities.\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements that could increase our costs and/or impair our ability to manufacture and sell certain products.\nOur ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities (or modifications to existing facilities) and operating all of our existing facilities. In addition, our Red River Plant may become subject to greenhouse gas emission trading requirements under which we may be required to purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our allocations. Greenhouse gas regulatory programs that have been adopted, such as cap-and-trade programs, have not had a significant impact on our business to date. Costs of complying with regulations could increase, as concerns related to greenhouse gases and climate change continue to emerge. The enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and/or the more aggressive interpretation of existing requirements could require us to incur significant costs for compliance or capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow. We may attempt to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts, and our success in offsetting any such increased regulatory costs is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales.\nWe may not be successful in achieving our growth expectations related to new products in our existing or new markets.\nWe may not be successful in achieving our growth expectations from developing new products for our existing or new markets. Further, we cannot ensure costs incurred to develop new products will result in an increase in revenues. Additionally, our ability to bring new products to the market will depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, solving potential technical or manufacturing difficulties, competition and market acceptance, which may hinder the timeliness and cost to bring such products to production. These factors or delays could affect our future operating results.\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, dispositions and strategic partnerships, and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have and may in the future expand the our scope of products, services, and technologies through selective acquisitions, investments or creating partnerships and joint ventures. We may also dispose of assets or portions of our business that no longer complement our long-term strategic objectives. We continually evaluate potential acquisition, disposition, and strategic partnership opportunities in the ordinary course of business. Acquisitions, dispositions, and strategic partnerships involve numerous risks, including among others:\n\u2022inability to negotiate favorable prices and terms;\n\u2022incorrect evaluations of the synergies and/or long-term benefits of the acquisition, disposition, and strategic partnership;\n\u2022integration difficulties, including challenges and costs associated with implementing systems, processes and controls to comply with the requirements of a publicly-traded company;\n\u2022diverting management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022litigation arising from acquisition and disposition activity;\n\u2022potential increased debt leverage;\n\u2022potential issuance of dilutive equity securities;\n\u2022entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022unanticipated costs and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities or operating challenges;\n\u2022potential goodwill or other intangible asset impairments;\n\u2022potential requirements to provide transition services in connection with a disposition, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus of management and employees;\n\u2022potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies;\n\u2022our ability to properly establish and maintain effective internal controls over an acquired company; and\n\u2022increasing demands on our operational and IT systems.\nThe success of an acquisition, disposition or strategic partnership is not always predictable, and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated, and our business may be adversely affected as a result.\nNatural disasters could affect our operations and financial results.\nWe operate facilities, including the Red River Plant and Five Forks Mine, that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms and hurricanes. Extreme weather events present physical risks that may become more frequent as a result of factors related to climate change. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.\nIn addition, extreme and unusually cold or hot temperatures throughout the U.S. could result in abnormally high loads on geographic electrical grids that could result in the failure of coal-fired power plants to produce electricity. If these plants were off-line for a significant period of time, the demand for our products could be less, which would impact our operations and financial results. Conversely, abnormally high loads on geographic electrical grids, resulting in increased demand of coal-fired power plants to produce electricity, could impact our ability to meet customer contracts and demands.\nInformation technology vulnerabilities and cyberattacks on our networks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on information technology (\"IT\") to manage and conduct business, both internally and externally, with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Internet transactions involve the transmission and storage of data including, in certain instances, customer and supplier business information. Therefore, maintaining the security of computers and other electronic devices, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers because security breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information.\nWe have limited personnel and other resources to address information technology reliability and security of our computer networks and to respond to known security incidents to minimize potential adverse impact. Experienced hackers, cybercriminals and perpetrators of threats may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that attack our information and networks or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our information and networks.\nTechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until after they are launched against a target, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A breach of our IT systems and security measures as a result of third party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to customer, supplier and other third party liabilities.\nRisks related to intellectual property\nFailure to protect our intellectual property or infringement of our intellectual property by a third party could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Such means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate because they provide only limited protection or such protection may be prohibitively expensive to enforce. We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and many of our customers and vendors, and generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Notwithstanding these measures, a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization. We cannot provide assurance that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology and intellectual property, which could negatively impact our business and\nfinancial condition. In addition, such actions by third parties could divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from third parties that are costly to defend and that may limit our ability to use the disputed technologies.\nIf our technologies are alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may be forced to mount a defense to such claims, which may be expensive and time consuming. During the pendency of litigation, we could be prevented from marketing and selling existing products or services and from pursuing research, development or commercialization of new or complimentary products or services. Further, we may be required to obtain licenses to third party intellectual property or be forced to develop or obtain alternative technologies. Our failure to obtain a license to a technology that we may require, or the need to develop or obtain alternative technologies, could significantly and negatively affect our business.\nIndemnification of third-party licensees of our technologies against intellectual property infringement claims concerning our licensed technology and our products could be financially significant to us.\nWe have agreed to indemnify licensees of our technologies (including Tinuum Group) and purchasers of our products, and we may enter into additional agreements with others under which we agree to indemnify and hold them harmless from losses they may incur as a result of the alleged infringement of third-party rights caused by the use of our technologies and products. Infringement claims, which are expensive and time-consuming to defend, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, even if we are successful in defending ourselves (and the indemnified parties) against them.\nOur future success depends in part on our ongoing identification and development of intellectual property and our ability to invest in and deploy new products, services and technologies into the marketplace efficiently and cost effectively.\nThe process of identifying customer needs and developing and enhancing products, services and solutions for our business segments is complex, costly and uncertain. Any failure by us to identify and anticipate changing needs, emerging trends and new regulations could significantly harm our future market share and results of operations.\nRisk related to tax matters\nAn \"ownership change\" could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nWe have certain general business credit tax credits (\"Tax Credits\"). As of December 31, 2021, we had $86.1 million of Tax Credits, equaling 87% of our total gross deferred tax assets. Our ability to use these Tax Credits to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change\" as discussed below. Under the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC') and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, we may carry forward or otherwise utilize the Tax Credits in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income, and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the Tax Credits do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will have available a significant amount of Tax Credits in future years, and therefore the Tax Credits could be a substantial asset to us. However, if we experience an \"ownership change,\" as defined in Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, our ability to use the Tax Credits may be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Credits could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset.\nIn general, an \"ownership change\" under Sections 382 and 383 occurs if the percentage of stock owned by an entity\u2019s 5% stockholders (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the entity immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize the Tax Credits arising from an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC would depend on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an \"ownership change,\" it is possible that a significant portion of our tax credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.\nOn May 5, 2017, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved the Tax Asset Protection Plan (the \"TAPP\") and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a \"Right\") for each outstanding share of our common stock. The TAPP\nwas adopted in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to diminish the risk that our ability to use the Tax Credits to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited. On April 9, 2021, the Board approved the Fourth Amendment to the TAPP (\"Fourth Amendment\") that amends the TAPP, as previously amended by the First, Second and Third Amendments that were approved the Board on April 6, 2018, April 5, 2019 and April 9, 2020, respectively. The Fourth Amendment amends the definition of \"Final Expiration Date\" under the TAPP to extend the duration of the TAPP and makes associated changes in connection therewith. At the Company's 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved the Fourth Amendment, thus the Final Expiration Date will be the close of business on December 31, 2022.\nThe TAPP, as amended, is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board. Stockholders who beneficially owned 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock upon execution of the Protection Plan will not trigger the Protection Plan so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of our common stock. The Board may, in its sole discretion, also exempt any person from triggering the Protection Plan.\nRisks related to our common stock\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so. The market price of our common stock may continue to be affected by numerous factors, including:\na.actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\nb.changes in laws or regulations and court rulings and trends in our industry;\nc.announcements of sales awards;\nd.changes in supply and demand of components and materials;\ne.adoption of new tax regulations or accounting standards affecting our industry;\nf.changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\ng.perceptions of the value of corporate transactions;\nh.trends in social responsibility and investment guidelines;\ni.whether we are able and elect to pay cash dividends;\nj.the continuation of repurchasing shares of common stock under stock repurchase programs; and\nk.the degree of trading liquidity in our common stock and general market conditions.\nFrom January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $3.76 to $12.49 per share. In June 2017, we commenced a quarterly cash dividend program and paid out cash dividends in each succeeding quarter through March 31, 2020. In 2018, we implemented stock repurchase programs, and repurchased a total of 20,613 shares of our common stock for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020 for cash of $0.2 million.\nStock price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase shares of our common stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. We believe our stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Board, and under our current stock repurchase program, we are not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, stock repurchases or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain additional capital and erode investor confidence, which could further reduce the liquidity of our common stock. We do not expect to repurchase additional shares of our common stock in the near term.\nWe are unlikely to resume our quarterly cash dividend program.\nThe Board first approved a $0.25 per share of common stock quarterly dividend in June 2017. We last paid a cash dividend on March 10, 2020.\nWith the ceasing of our cash-generating RC segment, it is unlikely, for the foreseeable future, that we will resume declaring quarterly cash dividends under a dividend program. The payment of future dividends will be affected by, among other factors: (1) our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions; (2) legal risks; (3) stock repurchase programs; (4) changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; (5) changes to our business model; and (6) any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These include provisions that:\na.Limit the business at special meetings of stockholders to the purpose stated in a notice of the meeting;\nb.Authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that the Board can create and issue without prior stockholder approval;\nc.Establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting; and\nd.Require the affirmative vote of the \"disinterested\" holders of a majority of our common stock to approve certain business combinations involving an \"interested stockholder\" or its affiliates, unless either minimum price criteria or procedural requirements are met, or the transaction is approved by a majority of our \"continuing directors\" (known as \"fair price provisions\").\nThese provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock, or could limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest.\nAn increased focus on environmental, social and governance factors by institutional investors may negatively impact our access to capital and the liquidity of our stock price.\nSome institutional investors have recently adopted Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") investing guidelines that may prevent them from increasing or taking new stakes with companies with exposure to fossil fuels. Additional institutional investors may adopt similar ESG investment guidelines. This could limit both the demand for owning our common stock and/or our access to capital. If such capital is desired, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional equity or debt financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Given these emerging trends, liquidity in our common stock and our stock price may be negatively impacted.\nWe may require additional funding for our growth plans, and such funding may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock, resulting in a dilution of your investment.\nWe estimate our funding requirements in order to implement our growth plans. If the actual funding required to implement growth initiatives should exceed funding estimates significantly, or our funds generated from our operations from such growth initiatives prove insufficient for such purposes, we may need to raise additional funds to meet these funding requirements.\nThese additional funds may be raised by issuing equity or debt securities or by borrowing from banks or other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we may not be able to implement such plans fully. Such financing, even if obtained, may be accompanied by conditions that limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek lenders\u2019 consent for payment of dividends, or restrict our ability to operate our business by requiring lender\u2019s consent for certain corporate actions. Further, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of new shares of our common stock, any shareholders who are unable or unwilling to participate in such an additional round of fund raising may suffer dilution of their investment.", "PERMNO": 90400, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ADES"}
