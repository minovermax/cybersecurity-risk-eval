{"cik": "1180145", "company": "Cardiovascular Systems Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a history of net losses and a short commercialization experience, and we are likely to continue to incur losses.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our formation in 1989. In particular, we had net losses of $32.8 million, $35.3 million, and $24.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $271.4 million. We commenced commercial sales of the PAD Systems in September 2007 and the CAD System in October 2013, and our short commercialization experience makes it difficult for us to predict future performance. We also expect to incur significant additional expenses for sales and marketing, research and development, and manufacturing as we continue to commercialize the PAD and CAD Systems and additional expenses as we seek to develop and commercialize future versions of the PAD and CAD Systems and any future products. Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as our business grows. As a result, our operating losses are likely to continue.\nWe may be unable to sustain our revenue growth.\nOur revenue has grown in each of the fiscal years since we commenced commercial sales of the PAD Systems in September 2007. Our ability to continue to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the PAD Systems and generate significant sales from the CAD System and new and improved products we introduce, which will, in turn, depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and reorders from those customers. We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis. If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nAdverse worldwide economic conditions may negatively impact our business. A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in their purchases and also in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our operating results. Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers' ability to provide us with materials and components, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe PAD Systems, the CAD System and future products may never achieve broad market acceptance.\nThe PAD and CAD Systems and future products we may develop may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe actual and perceived effectiveness and reliability of our products;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse patient events involving our products;\n\u2022\nthe results of any clinical trials relating to use of our products;\n\u2022\nthe availability, relative cost and perceived advantages and disadvantages of alternative technologies or treatment methods for conditions treated by our products;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which treatments using our products are approved for reimbursement by public and private insurers;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which physicians adopt the PAD and CAD Systems;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we are successful in educating physicians about PAD and CAD in general and the existence and benefits of the PAD and CAD Systems in particular;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our marketing and distribution infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nthe level of education and awareness among physicians and hospitals concerning our products.\nFailure of the PAD and CAD Systems to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the PAD and CAD Systems, which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.\nThe availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain. The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available. We expect our products to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients. While third-party payors are currently providing reimbursement for our products, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide adequate reimbursement for use of the PAD and CAD Systems to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for our products will continue. In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD and CAD treatment could decrease in the future. Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.\nMedicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of our products. In order to position our products for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.\nGovernmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs. Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures. It is uncertain whether our current products or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.\nIf third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products is limited or not available, the acceptance of our products and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system, some of which have been enacted into law, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Patient Act. The Patient Act and any additional healthcare proposals and laws that may be enacted in the future could also limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The Patient Act and future healthcare legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in the health care reform legislation.\nThe imposition of the 2.3% medical device excise tax enacted as part of the Patient Act has adversely affected our financial results and has required, and will continue to require, us to identify ways to reduce spending in other areas or raise additional capital to offset the increased expense. We have not been able to pass along the cost of the tax to our customers or offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage and do not expect to be able to do so in the future. Ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the PAD and CAD Systems. Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.\nBecause our technology is relatively new in the treatment of PAD and CAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations. The long-term effects of using the PAD and CAD Systems in a large number of patients have not been studied and the results of short-term clinical use of the PAD or CAD Systems do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects. We are conducting and developing several clinical trials, and there are substantial risks and uncertainties involved in these trials. We must devote substantial resources to our clinical trials, clinical trials often take several years to develop and conduct, there are difficulties involved in locating sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, and the results of every trial are uncertain until the trial is completed. These uncertainties could adversely impact our financial results, our reputation and the reputation of our products.\nClinical trials conducted with the PAD and CAD Systems have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient. Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the PAD and CAD Systems and materially harm our business.\nWe face significant competition, must innovate to stay competitive, and may be unable to sell the PAD or CAD Systems at profitable levels.\nThe market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and, while certain barriers exist to entry into our market, we cannot assure that new entrants or existing competitors will not be able to develop products that compete directly with our products. We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, atherectomy catheter manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures. We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations and worldwide distribution channels.\nOur competitors may:\n\u2022\ndevelop and patent processes or products earlier than we will;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory clearances or approvals for competing medical device products more rapidly than we will;\n\u2022\nmarket their products more effectively than we will; or\n\u2022\ndevelop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.\nWe have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors. If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer. Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results. Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the PAD and CAD Systems or may need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.\nWe have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the PAD Systems, even less experience in commercially manufacturing the CAD System and no experience manufacturing these products in the volume that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales. As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the PAD and CAD Systems or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.\nThe forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect. Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the PAD and CAD Systems and future products. Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products. We rely on single source suppliers for certain components of the PAD and CAD Systems. We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements. These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers' demands.\nAny supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have increased the size of our organization and expect to continue to do so, and we may experience difficulties managing growth. If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2015, we expanded the size of our organization, particularly in the number of sales and marketing personnel, and we plan to continue this growth. The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to also rapidly expand other aspects of our business, including our manufacturing operations. Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations. If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.\nWe intend to sell our products internationally in the future, but we may experience difficulties in obtaining approval to do so or in successfully marketing our products internationally even if approved.\nCurrently, all of our revenues are in the United States; however, we intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan. There can be no guarantee that we will receive approval to sell our products internationally, nor can there be any guarantee that any sales would result even if such approval is received. In addition, we will incur substantial expenses in connection with international expansion. Our inability to successfully enter international markets and manage business on a global scale could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management and other key personnel. Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical specialists, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments. The loss of members of our senior management, sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists and engineers could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow our company. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.\nOur stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Our common stock traded as low as $23.15 and as high as $41.28 per share during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2015. Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of vascular disease;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who cover our stock;\n\u2022\naccusations that we have violated a law or regulation;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in healthcare policy and reimbursement levels; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other pre-change tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur ability to market the PAD Systems in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD and our ability to market the CAD System in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.\nThe PAD Systems received FDA 510(k) clearances in the U.S. for use as a therapy in patients with PAD, and in October 2013, we received PMA to use the CAD System as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD. These general clearances and approvals restrict our ability to market or advertise the PAD Systems and the CAD System beyond these uses and could affect our growth.\nIf we determine to market our orbital technology in the U.S. for other uses, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA. Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to use our orbital atherectomy technology for applications other than the treatment of PAD and CAD.\nWe are or will be subject to an extensive set of post-market controls that apply to us as we commercialize our products, including annual PMA reports, Medical Device Reports on serious adverse events, complaint handling and analysis under the FDA's QSR, export controls, advertising and promotion requirements, and potential post-market studies required by the FDA.\nWe and our suppliers are also subject to regulation by various state authorities, which may inspect our or our suppliers' facilities and manufacturing processes and enforce state regulations. Failure to comply with applicable state regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions.\nOur promotion of the PAD and CAD Systems is closely controlled by the FDA and enforcement activities could limit our ability to inform potential customers of the features of the products.\nThe PAD Systems or the CAD System may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and product liability claims that could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. For example, since commercialization of the PAD Systems, we have had minor instances of recalls, including, in the year ended June 30, 2015, one recall involving thirty CAD Systems due to an issue with the polymer coating on the saline sheath. Any recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, if the PAD or CAD Systems are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. The use, misuse or off-label use of the PAD or CAD Systems may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business. We cannot prevent a physician from using the PAD or CAD Systems for off-label applications. While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from claims that are brought against us.\nWe are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nThe PAD and CAD Systems and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls or corrections and promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. In particular, we are required to comply with the QSR and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval. We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers. Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nwarning or other letters from the FDA;\n\u2022\nfines, injunctions and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nproduct recall or seizure;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures;\n\u2022\ndelays in clearing or approving or refusal to clear or approve products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal or suspension of approval or clearance by the FDA or other regulatory bodies;\n\u2022\norders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production or clinical trials; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.\nOur operations are also subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.\nIn addition, our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as further described below.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers' compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting \u201ckickbacks\u201d and false and fraudulent claims which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenges to or investigations into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nThe federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws, prohibit payments that are intended to induce health care professionals or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services. A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and health care organizations. In addition, some state statutes, most notably laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, impose outright bans on certain gifts to physicians as well as requiring reporting of payments to physicians. Some of these laws, referred to as \u201caggregate spend\u201d or \u201cgift\u201d laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires us to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals.\nIt is widely anticipated that public reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payments regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals. These anti-kickback, public reporting and aggregate spend laws affect our sales, marketing and other promotional, and clinical activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of medical devices. They also impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us. In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements, and clinical trials. If we were to offer or pay inappropriate inducements to purchase our products, we could be subject to a claim under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws. If we fail to comply with particular reporting requirements, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Although we do not submit claims directly to government healthcare programs or other payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, by providing improper financial inducements, or through certain other activities.\nIn providing billing and coding information to customers, we make every effort to ensure that the billing and coding information furnished is accurate and that treating physicians understand that they are responsible for all treatment decisions. Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent or that the government will not examine our role in providing information to our customers and physicians concerning the benefits of therapy with our devices. Likewise, our financial relationships with customers, physicians, or others in a position to influence the purchase or use of our products may be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws. False claims laws prescribe civil, criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial. Moreover, an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.\nFor example, on May 8, 2014, we received a letter from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of North Carolina stating that it is investigating the Company to determine whether we had violated the False Claims Act. The letter enclosed a Civil Investigative Demand (\u201cCID\u201d) for written interrogatories and document requests. On July 8, 2015, the complaint underlying this investigation was unsealed. We have not yet been served the complaint and cannot predict if or when the complaint will be served on us and whether this case will proceed. The government has the option to intervene in a False Claims Act case and take over the prosecution if it concludes that the claims have merit. As of the date hereof, the government has not chosen to intervene in this case. We maintain rigorous policies and procedures to promote compliance with the False Claims Act and other regulatory requirements and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit, should it proceed. However, we cannot predict when the investigation or this litigation will be resolved, the outcome of the investigation or this litigation, or the potential impact of either on us. The existence of the investigation and litigation and any adverse outcome of either could negatively affect our reputation, be costly to respond to, and harm our business and results of operations.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. These disclosure requirements require ongoing due diligence efforts and disclosure obligations. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products.\nOur anticipated international expansion will subject us to increased legal and regulatory requirements, which could have a material effect on our business.\nWe intend to sell internationally in the future and have commenced the process of seeking approval to do so in both Europe and Japan. Movement into international markets will subject us and our products to different and increased laws and regulations, including foreign medical device regulations; tax laws; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; export laws; and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws. Although we have and will continue to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as those companies to which we will outsource certain aspects of our business\noperations, including those based in foreign countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies. We will incur additional compliance costs associated with global operations, and any alleged or actual violations of these laws and regulations could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, sanctions and other liabilities, and prohibitions on business conduct, and could negatively affect our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.\nOur success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property. Our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. Also, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us. Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology and achieve competitive advantages.\nChanges in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.\nWe may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property. The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.\nDespite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective in securing necessary assignments from these third parties.\nClaims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.\nThe medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights. The likelihood that patent infringement or misappropriation claims may be brought against us increases as we achieve more visibility in the marketplace and introduce products to market. We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for the treatment of vascular disease. The owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents. There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe. In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.\nAny infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management's attention from our business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent. We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.", "PERMNO": 91365, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "CSII"}
