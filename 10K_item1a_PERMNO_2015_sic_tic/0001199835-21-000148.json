{"cik": "1431959", "company": "TORCHLIGHT ENERGY RESOURCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before investing in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of these factors relate to the Arrangement as well as to the risks associated with Meta\u2019s business and the industry in which Meta operates and our business and the industry in which we operate. The risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAn occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to negatively affect, and has to date negatively affected, our operations.\nThe occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to, and has already, negatively affected our operations. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and the effects of, and response to, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited access to our facilities, properties, management, support staff and professional advisors. These, in turn, have not only negatively impacted our operations and financial condition, but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in declines in the demand for, and the price of, oil and gas, and it is unclear how long this decline will last. The full effect on our business and operation is currently unknown. In the event that the effects of COVID-19 continue in the future and/or the economy continues to deteriorate, we may be forced to curtail our operations and may be unable to pay our debt obligations, if any, (all notes payable have been paid or converted at the date of this filing) as they come due.\nThe coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on oil and gas prices, and depending on the severity and longevity of the pandemic, it may result in a major economic recession which will continue to depress oil and gas prices and cause our business and results of operations to suffer.\nThe inability and/or unwillingness of individuals to congregate in large groups, travel and/or visit retail businesses or travel outside of their homes will, and has to date, had a negative effect on the demand for, and the current prices of, oil and gas. Additionally, the demand for oil and gas is based partially on global economic conditions. If the COVID-19 pandemic results in a global economic recession, there will be a continued negative effect on the demand for oil and gas and this will have a negative effect on our operating results. All of the above may be exacerbated in the future as the COVID-19 outbreak and the governmental responses thereto continue. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad continues to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could further diminish, which will impact the price at which we can sell our oil and gas, impact the value of our working interests and other oil and gas assets, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations, affect our operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Arrangement\nThe Arrangement may not be completed due to failure to obtain the necessary court and/or regulatory approvals.\nTo complete the Arrangement, we and Meta must make certain filings with and obtain certain consents and approvals from various governmental and regulatory authorities including the Court, and the approval of Nasdaq of the listing of the shares of the combined company to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement. We and Meta have not yet obtained these approvals, all of which are required to complete the Arrangement. The regulatory approval processes may take a lengthy period of time to complete which could delay completion of the Arrangement. The approval processes, including the undertakings and conditions that may be required for approval or whether the court and regulatory approvals, may not be obtained.\nUncertainty surrounding the Arrangement could adversely affect our retention of strategic partners and personnel and could negatively impact our future business and operations.\nBecause the Arrangement is dependent upon satisfaction of certain conditions, its completion is subject to uncertainty. In response to this uncertainty, our strategic partners may delay or defer decisions concerning our business. Any delay or deferral of those decisions by strategic partners could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations, regardless of whether the Arrangement is ultimately completed.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nWe could fail to complete the Arrangement.\nThe Arrangement may not be completed as there are certain conditions that are outside of our control and the control of Meta. The completion of the Arrangement is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions which include, among others, (i) obtaining necessary approvals of securityholders and debtholders, if any, of us and Meta, (ii) that not more than 10% of the Meta shareholders exercise any dissent rights; (iii) the Pre-Closing Financing is completed (which has been satisfied); and (iv) performance by us and Meta of the respective obligations and covenants in the Arrangement Agreement. These conditions may not be satisfied.\nIn addition, we and Meta each have the right to terminate the Arrangement Agreement in certain circumstances. Accordingly, there is no certainty that the Arrangement Agreement will not be terminated by either us or Meta before the completion of the Arrangement. For example, we have the right, in certain circumstances, to terminate the Arrangement Agreement if changes occur that, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect. Although a material adverse effect excludes certain events that are beyond our control and the control of Meta, a change having a material adverse effect on Meta may occur before the effective date of the Arrangement, in which case we could elect to terminate the Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement would not proceed. In addition, if the Arrangement is not completed by May 15, 2021, we or Meta may choose to terminate the Arrangement Agreement in accordance with its terms.\nIf the Arrangement is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected as a result of the costs (including opportunity costs) incurred in respect of pursuing the Arrangement, and we could experience negative reactions from the financial markets, which could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock, particularly if the market price reflects market assumptions that the Arrangement will be completed or completed on certain terms. We may also experience a negative impact on our ability to attract future acquisition opportunities. Failure to complete the Arrangement or a change in the terms of the Arrangement could each have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Arrangement is not completed and our board of directors decides to seek another merger or business combination, we may not be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction that is equivalent to, or more attractive than, the Arrangement. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination payment of $2 million, or the Termination Payment, to Meta as described in the Proxy.\nThe Termination Payment, if triggered, and the fact that certain of our stockholders have agreed to vote in favor of the Arrangement related proposals at the special meeting of our stockholders to approve the Arrangement, may discourage other parties from attempting to acquire us.\nUnder the Arrangement Agreement, we are required to pay a Termination Payment of $2 million to Meta in the event the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances. The Termination Payment may discourage other parties from attempting to engage in a transaction with us or otherwise make an alternative Acquisition Proposal, even if those parties would otherwise be willing to offer greater value to our stockholders than that offered by Meta under the Arrangement.\nFurthermore, as noted above, certain of our stockholders have agreed to irrevocably commit the shares to, among other things, vote in favor of the proposals related to the Arrangement at a special meeting of our stockholders. As a result, other parties may be discouraged from attempting to engage in a transaction with us, even if those parties would otherwise be willing to offer greater value to our stockholders than that offered by Meta under the Arrangement.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nWe will incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Arrangement even if the Arrangement is not completed.\nCertain costs related to the Arrangement, such as legal, accounting and certain financial advisor fees must be paid by us even if the Arrangement is not completed, and some of such costs may be unanticipated, or underestimated by our management. Also, if the Arrangement is not completed, we may be required to pay the Termination Payment to Meta in certain circumstances. Such costs may offset any expected cost savings and other synergies from the Arrangement.\nWhile the Arrangement is pending, we are restricted from taking certain actions.\nThe Arrangement Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions until the Arrangement is completed without the consent of Meta, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain business strategies including, but not limited to, the ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Arrangement.\nThe pending Arrangement may divert the attention of our management.\nThe pending Arrangement could cause the attention of our management to be diverted from the day-to-day operations. These disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Arrangement and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or prospects, regardless of whether the Arrangement is ultimately completed.\nFollowing the completion of the Arrangement, the combined company may issue additional securities.\nFollowing the completion of the Arrangement, the combined company may issue additional securities (including equity securities) to finance its activities, including in order to finance acquisitions. If the combined company were to issue additional equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted and some or all of the combined company\u2019s financial measures on a per share basis could be reduced. Moreover, as the combined company\u2019s intention to issue additional equity securities becomes publicly known, the combined company\u2019s share price may be materially adversely affected.\nOur stockholders may not receive any dividends in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nIn connection with the Arrangement, we will declare a dividend of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to holders of record of our common stock as of a date to be determined by our board of directors. Such dividend will be paid immediately prior to the closing of the Arrangement. The Series A Certificate of Designation will entitle the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to receive dividends, or Asset Sale Dividends, comprised of the holder\u2019s pro rata portion of the proceeds from the sale of the O&G Assets, (\u201cO&G Asset Sales\u201d) in the event that we or the combined company consummates one or more such transaction prior to the Sale Expiration Date. However, we or the combined company may not be able to consummate any such transaction prior to such date on terms that will permit us or the combined company to pay such dividends, or at all.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive Asset Sale Dividends from any O&G Asset Sale that is consummated prior to the Sale Expiration Date. Prior to declaring or paying any dividend, the combined company will deduct from the gross proceeds of an O&G Asset Sale various costs and expenses described in the Series A Certificate of Designation, which include, among others, (i) costs and expenses we or the combined company incurs in connection with the applicable O&G Asset Sale transaction, (ii) costs the combined company incurs following the consummation of the Arrangement with respect to the O&G Assets, (iii) taxes the combined company incurs in connection with the applicable O&G Asset Sale, the payment of dividends to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, and the O&G Assets, (iv) liabilities the combined company incurs in connection with the applicable O&G Asset Sale and (v) amounts paid or payable with respect to outstanding debt, if any. In addition, the combined company will also withhold an amount of 10% of the proceeds from each O&G Asset Sale, (\u201cthe Holdback Amount\u201d) to cover potential post-closing liabilities and obligations that the combined company may incur in respect of such transaction. If, after the deduction and withholding of these amounts, there are no net proceeds available for distribution to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, then the combined company will not declare or pay a dividend with respect to that transaction unless and until any remaining funds from the Holdback Amount are due to be distributed to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock through a dividend, or the combined company receives additional net proceeds from such O&G Asset Sale (for example, as a result of post-closing payments or the release of escrowed funds).\nIn the event that any O&G Assets have not been sold in an O&G Asset Sale that is consummated prior to the Sale Expiration Date, the combined company will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, declare a spin-off dividend to distribute beneficial ownership of the remaining O&G Assets to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock. However, if the combined company cannot effect such spin-off dividend in a manner that is exempt from registration under all applicable securities laws, the combined company will not declare the spin-off dividend and instead will use good faith, commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the value of the remaining O&G Assets or to distribute or provide the value of the remaining O&G Assets to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, so long as the combined company is not required to divert the attention of management or incur material expenses in excess of amount required to be reserved under the Arrangement Agreement. Thus, we, or the combined company, ultimately may not be able to deliver the value of any remaining O&G Assets to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock will not be listed or traded on any exchange.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock to be issued by us to holders of record of our common stock as of a record day fixed by our board of directors and will not be listed or traded on any exchange. No market is expected to develop for the Series A Preferred Stock in the foreseeable future and holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may not be able to find a buyer and sell their shares if they desired to do so.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nRisks Related to Torchlight\u2019s Business and Industry if the Arrangement does not occur\nWe have a limited operating history relative to larger companies in our industry and may not be successful in developing profitable business operations.\nWe have a limited operating history relative to larger companies in our industry. Our business operations must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in establishing a business in the oil and natural gas industries. As of the date of this report, we have generated limited revenues and have limited assets. We have an insufficient history at this time on which to base an assumption that our business operations will prove to be successful in the long-term. Our future operating results will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to raise adequate working capital;\n\u25cf the success of our development and exploration;\n\u25cf the demand for natural gas and oil;\n\u25cf the level of our competition;\n\u25cf our ability to attract and maintain key management and employees; and\n\u25cf our ability to efficiently explore, develop, produce or acquire sufficient quantities of marketable natural gas or oil in a highly competitive and speculative environment while maintaining quality and controlling costs.\nTo achieve profitable operations in the future, we must, alone or with others, successfully manage the factors stated above, as well as continue to develop ways to enhance our production efforts. Despite our best efforts, we may not be successful in our exploration or development efforts or obtain required regulatory approvals. There is a possibility that some, or all, of the wells in which we obtain interests may never produce oil or natural gas.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nWe have limited capital and will need to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe do not currently have sufficient capital to fund both our continuing operations and our planned growth should the Arrangement not occur. We will require additional capital to continue to grow our business via acquisitions and to further expand our exploration and development programs. We may be unable to obtain additional capital when required. Future acquisitions and future exploration, development, production and marketing activities, as well as our administrative requirements (such as salaries, insurance expenses and general overhead expenses, as well as legal compliance costs and accounting expenses) will require a substantial amount of additional capital and cash flow.\nWe may pursue sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, including joint venturing of projects, debt financing, equity financing, or other means. We may not be successful in identifying suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. If we do not succeed in raising additional capital, our resources may not be sufficient to fund our planned operations.\nOur ability to obtain financing, if and when necessary, may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets (both generally and in the oil and gas industry in particular), our limited operating history, the location of our oil and natural gas properties and prices of oil and natural gas on the commodities markets (which will impact the amount of asset-based financing available to us, if any) and the departure of key employees. Further, if oil or natural gas prices on the commodities markets decline, our future revenues, if any, will likely decrease and such decreased revenues may increase our requirements for capital. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs (even to the extent that we reduce our operations), we may be required to cease our operations, divest our assets at unattractive prices or obtain financing on unattractive terms.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders. Raising any such capital could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. The terms of securities we issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable to our new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of other derivative securities, and issuances of incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans, which may have a further dilutive effect.\nWe may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nOur auditor indicated that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe financial statements included with this report are presented under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time. We had a net loss of approximately $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and an accumulated deficit in aggregate of approximately $111.9 million at year end. We are not generating sufficient operating cash flows to support continuing operations and expect to incur further losses in the development of our business.\nIn our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, our auditor indicated that certain factors raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These factors included our accumulated deficit, as well as the fact that we were not generating sufficient operating cash flows to meet our regular working capital requirements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management\u2019s plan to address our ability to continue as a going concern includes: (1) obtaining debt or equity funding from private placement or institutional sources; (2) obtaining loans from financial institutions, where possible, or (3) participating in joint venture transactions with third parties. Although management believes that it will be able to obtain the necessary funding to allow us to remain a going concern through the methods discussed above, there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nAs a non-operator, our development of successful operations relies extensively on third parties who, if not successful, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nIf the Arrangement does not occur, we expect to primarily participate in wells operated by third parties. As a result, we will not control the timing of the development, exploitation, production and exploration activities relating to leasehold interests we acquire. We do, however, have certain rights as granted in our joint operating agreements that allow us a certain degree of freedom such as, but not limited to, the ability to propose the drilling of wells. If our drilling partners are not successful in such activities relating to our leasehold interests, or are unable or unwilling to perform, our financial condition and results of operation could have an adverse material effect.\nFurther, financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for the joint activity obligations of the operator or other working interest owners such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of the working interest owners. In the event the operator or other working interest owners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs. In such situations, if we were unable to pay those costs, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial position.\nWe are mainly concentrated in one geographic area, which increases our exposure to many of the risks enumerated herein.\nOperating in a concentrated area increases the potential impact that many of the risks stated herein may have upon our ability to perform. For example, we have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting Texas, natural disasters in the geographic area, competition for equipment, services and materials available in the area and access to infrastructure and markets. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and gas producing areas such as the Permian Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to monetize the Orogrande and Hazel Projects at an attractive price, if at all, and the disposition of such assets may involve risks and uncertainties.\nWe have commenced a process that could result in the monetization of the Orogrande and Hazel Projects. Such dispositions may result in proceeds to us in an amount less than we expect or less than our assessment of the value of the assets. We do not know if we will be able to successfully complete such disposition on favorable terms or at all. In addition, the sale of these assets involves risks and uncertainties, including disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of customers or revenue, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations and liabilities to us following any such divestiture.\nFor example, in connection with a disposition, we may enter into transition services agreements or other strategic relationships, which may result in additional expense. In addition, in connection with a disposition, we may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the business or assets. We may also be required to indemnify the purchasers to the extent that our representations turn out to be inaccurate or with respect to certain potential liabilities. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay money to the purchasers as satisfaction of their indemnity claims. It may also take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of this transaction, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the speculative nature of oil and gas exploration, there is risk that we will not find commercially exploitable oil and gas and that our business will fail.\nThe search for commercial quantities of oil and natural gas as a business is extremely risky. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that any properties in which we obtain a mineral interest will contain commercially exploitable quantities of oil and/or gas. The exploration expenditures to be made by us may not result in the discovery of commercial quantities of oil and/or gas. Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, invasion of water into producing formations and other conditions involved in oil and gas exploration often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. If we are unable to find commercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas, and/or we are unable to commercially extract such quantities, we may be forced to abandon or curtail our business plan, and as a result, any investment in us may become worthless.\nStrategic relationships upon which we may rely are subject to change, which may diminish our ability to conduct our operations.\nShould the Arrangement not occur, our ability to successfully acquire oil and gas interests, to build our reserves, to participate in drilling opportunities and to identify and enter into commercial arrangements with customers will depend on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants and our ability to select and evaluate suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. These realities are subject to change and our inability to maintain close working relationships with industry participants or continue to acquire suitable property may impair our ability to execute our business plan.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nTo continue to develop our business should the Arrangement not occur, we will endeavor to use the business relationships of our management to enter into strategic relationships, which may take the form of joint ventures with other private parties and contractual arrangements with other oil and gas companies, including those that supply equipment and other resources that we will use in our business. We may not be able to establish these strategic relationships, or if established, we may not be able to maintain them. In addition, the dynamics of our relationships with strategic partners may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to in order to fulfill our obligations to these partners or maintain our relationships. If our strategic relationships are not established or maintained, our business prospects may be limited, which could diminish our ability to conduct our operations.\nThe price of oil and natural gas has historically been volatile. If it were to decrease substantially, our projections, budgets, and revenues would be adversely affected, potentially forcing us to make changes in our operations.\nShould the Arrangement not occur, our future financial condition, results of operations and the carrying value of any oil and natural gas interests we acquire will depend primarily upon the prices paid for oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and likely will continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current world geopolitical conditions. Our cash flows from operations are highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas. This price volatility also affects the amount of our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf the level of consumer demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf the price of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf domestic governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u25cf weather conditions;\n\u25cf market uncertainty due to political conditions in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East; and\n\u25cf worldwide economic conditions.\nThese factors as well as the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. Declines in oil and natural gas prices affect our revenues and could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Accordingly, such declines could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties. If the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines, we may be unable to make planned expenditures, among other things. If this were to happen, we may be forced to abandon or curtail our business operations, which would cause the value of an investment in us to decline or become worthless.\nIn early March of 2020, the market experienced a precipitous decline in oil prices in response to oil demand concerns due to the economic impacts of the a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus known as COVID-19 and anticipated increases in supply from Russia and OPEC, particularly Saudi Arabia. Generally, demand for oil has declined substantially. These trends materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and, unless conditions in our industry improve, this trend will continue.\nIf oil or natural gas prices remain depressed or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record additional write downs of our oil and natural gas properties.\nIf oil or natural gas prices remain depressed or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we could be required to write down the carrying value of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. Write downs may occur when oil and natural gas prices are low, or if we have downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of operating or development costs, deterioration in drilling results or mechanical problems with wells where the cost to redrill or repair is not supported by the expected economics.\nUnder the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves plus the cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization (without regard to estimates of fair value), or estimated fair value, if lower, of unproved properties that are subject to amortization. Should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling, an impairment would be recognized.\nThe Company recognized an impairment charge of $2,108,301 in 2020 and $1,494,769 in 2019.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nBecause of the inherent dangers involved in oil and gas operations, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages as we conduct our business operations, which could force us to expend a substantial amount of money in connection with litigation and/or a settlement.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to us from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property purchased and leased by us. In recent years, there has also been increased scrutiny on the environmental risk associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as underground migration and surface spillage or mishandling of fracturing fluids including chemical additives. This technology has evolved and continues to evolve and become more aggressive. We believe that new techniques can increase estimated ultimate recovery per well to over 1.0 million barrels of oil equivalent and have increased initial production two or three-fold. We believe that recent designs have seen improvement in, among other things, proppant per foot, barrels of water per stage, fracturing stages, and clusters per fracturing stage. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or result in the loss of our properties and/or force us to expend substantial monies in connection with litigation or settlements. In addition, we will need to quickly adapt to the evolving technology, which could take time and divert our attention to other business matters. We currently have no insurance to cover such losses and liabilities, and even if insurance is obtained, it may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. We cannot predict the availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify our purchase. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. We may elect to self-insure if management believes that the cost of insurance, although available, is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for oil and gas is intensely competitive, and competition pressures could force us to abandon or curtail our business plan.\nThe market for oil and gas exploration services is highly competitive, and we only expect competition to intensify in the future. Numerous well-established companies are focusing significant resources on exploration and are currently competing with us for oil and gas opportunities. Other oil and gas companies may seek to acquire oil and gas leases and properties that we have targeted. Additionally, other companies engaged in our line of business may compete with us from time to time in obtaining capital from investors. Competitors include larger companies which, in particular, may have access to greater resources, may be more successful in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and may conduct their own refining and petroleum marketing operations, which may give them a competitive advantage. Actual or potential competitors may be strengthened through the acquisition of additional assets and interests. Additionally, there are numerous companies focusing their resources on creating fuels and/or materials which serve the same purpose as oil and gas but are manufactured from renewable resources.\nAs a result, we may not be able to compete successfully and competitive pressures may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, should the Arrangement not occur. If we are not able to successfully compete in the marketplace, we could be forced to curtail or even abandon our current business plan, which could cause any investment in us to become worthless.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage growth, which could lead to our inability to implement our business plan.\nAny growth of the company may place a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources, especially considering that we currently only have a small number of executive officers, employees and advisors. Further, as we enter into additional contracts, we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various consultants, businesses and other third parties. These requirements will be exacerbated in the event of our further growth or in the event that the number of our drilling and/or extraction operations increases. Our systems, procedures and/or controls may not be adequate to support our operations or that our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our business plan. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected, which could lead to us being forced to abandon or curtail our business plan and operations.\nThe due diligence undertaken by us in connection with all of our acquisitions may not have revealed all relevant considerations or liabilities related to those assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nThe due diligence undertaken by us in connection with the acquisition of our properties may not have revealed all relevant facts that may be necessary to evaluate such acquisitions. The information provided to us in connection with our diligence may have been incomplete or inaccurate. As part of the diligence process, we have also made subjective judgments regarding the results of operations and prospects of the assets. If the due diligence investigations have failed to correctly identify material issues and liabilities that may be present, such as title defects or environmental problems, we may incur substantial impairment charges or other losses in the future. In addition, we may be subject to significant, previously undisclosed liabilities that were not identified during the due diligence processes and which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are heavily dependent on current environmental regulation, changes in which we cannot predict.\nOil and natural gas activities that we will engage in, including production, processing, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials (if any), are subject to stringent regulation. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of hazardous material, third-party claims for property damage and personal injuries fines and sanctions, as a result of any violations or liabilities under environmental or other laws. Changes in or more stringent enforcement of environmental laws could force us to expend additional operating costs and capital expenditures to stay in compliance.\nVarious federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, directly impact oil and gas exploration, development and production operations, and consequently may impact our operations and costs. These regulations include, among others, (i) regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and non-hazardous wastes; (ii) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws which regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), property contamination (including groundwater contamination),and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination; (iii) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements which may result in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations; (iv) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States; (v) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; and (vi) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive material.\nWe believe that we will be in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. To date, we have not expended any amounts to comply with such regulations, and we do not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, if we are deemed to not be in compliance with applicable environmental laws, we could be forced to expend substantial amounts to be in compliance, which would have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition.\nGovernment regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nVast quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil deposits exist in deep shale and other unconventional formations. It is customary in our industry to recover these resources through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in deep underground formations using water, sand and other additives pumped under high pressure into the formation. As with the rest of the industry, our third-party operating partners use hydraulic fracturing as a means to increase the productivity of most of the wells they drill and complete. These formations are generally geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by thousands of feet of impermeable rock layers.\nWe believe our third-party operating partners follow applicable legal requirements for groundwater protection in their operations that are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators. Furthermore, we believe our third-party operating partners\u2019 well construction practices are specifically designed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers.\nHydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations.\nIn addition to state laws, some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, that may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. There are also certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices, including hydraulic fracturing. Depending on the outcome of these studies, federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate such activities. Certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process.\nFurther, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving \u201cdiesel fuels\u201d under the Solid Waste Disposal Act\u2019s Underground Injection Control Program. The EPA is also engaged in a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water resources in the states where the EPA is the permitting authority. These actions, in conjunction with other analyses by federal and state agencies to assess the impacts of hydraulic fracturing could spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nWe cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it prohibitive for our third-party operating partners to conduct operations, and also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, our business and operations could be subject to delays, increased operating and compliance costs and process prohibitions.\nOur estimates of the volume of reserves could have flaws, or such reserves could turn out not to be commercially extractable. As a result, our future revenues and projections could be incorrect.\nEstimates of reserves and of future net revenues prepared by different petroleum engineers may vary substantially depending, in part, on the assumptions made and may be subject to adjustment either up or down in the future. Our actual amounts of production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from the estimates. Oil and gas reserve estimates are necessarily inexact and involve matters of subjective engineering judgment. In addition, any estimates of our future net revenues and the present value thereof are based on assumptions derived in part from historical price and cost information, which may not reflect current and future values, and/or other assumptions made by us that only represent our best estimates. If these estimates of quantities, prices and costs prove inaccurate, we may be unsuccessful in expanding our oil and gas reserves base with our acquisitions. Additionally, if declines in and instability of oil and gas prices occur, then write downs in the capitalized costs associated with any oil and gas assets we obtain may be required. Because of the nature of the estimates of our reserves and estimates in general, reductions to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves and estimated future net revenues may not be required in the future, and/or that our estimated reserves may not present and/or commercially extractable. If our reserve estimates are incorrect, we may be forced to write down the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties.\nDecommissioning costs are unknown and may be substantial. Unplanned costs could divert resources from other projects.\nWe may become responsible for costs associated with abandoning and reclaiming wells, facilities and pipelines which we use for production of oil and natural gas reserves. Abandonment and reclamation of these facilities and the costs associated therewith is often referred to as \u201cdecommissioning.\u201d We accrue a liability for decommissioning costs associated with our wells but have not established any cash reserve account for these potential costs in respect of any of our properties. If decommissioning is required before economic depletion of our properties or if our estimates of the costs of decommissioning exceed the value of the reserves remaining at any particular time to cover such decommissioning costs, we may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The use of other funds to satisfy such decommissioning costs could impair our ability to focus capital investment in other areas of our business.\nWe may have difficulty distributing production, which could harm our financial condition.\nIn order to sell the oil and natural gas that we are able to produce, if any, the operators of the wells we obtain interests in may have to make arrangements for storage and distribution to the market. We will rely on local infrastructure and the availability of transportation for storage and shipment of our products, but infrastructure development and storage and transportation facilities may be insufficient for our needs at commercially acceptable terms in the localities in which we operate. This situation could be particularly problematic to the extent that our operations are conducted in remote areas that are difficult to access, such as areas that are distant from shipping and/or pipeline facilities. These factors may affect our and potential partners\u2019 ability to explore and develop properties and to store and transport oil and natural gas production, increasing our expenses.\nFurthermore, weather conditions or natural disasters, actions by companies doing business in one or more of the areas in which we will operate, or labor disputes may impair the distribution of oil and/or natural gas and in turn diminish our financial condition or ability to maintain our operations.\nOur business will suffer if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary licenses.\nOur operations, should the Arrangement not occur, will require licenses, permits and in some cases renewals of licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. Our ability to obtain, sustain or renew such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to change in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable governments, among other factors. Our inability to obtain, or our loss of or denial of extension of, any of these licenses or permits could hamper our ability to produce revenues from our operations.\nChallenges to our properties may impact our financial condition.\nTitle to oil and gas interests is often not capable of conclusive determination without incurring substantial expense. While we have made and intend to make appropriate inquiries into the title of properties and other development rights we have acquired and intend to acquire, title defects may exist. In addition, we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance for title defects, on a commercially reasonable basis or at all. If title defects do exist, it is possible that we may lose all or a portion of our right, title and interests in and to the properties to which the title defects relate. If our property rights are reduced, our ability to conduct our exploration, development and production activities may be impaired. To mitigate title problems, common industry practice is to obtain a title opinion from a qualified oil and gas attorney prior to the drilling operations of a well.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nWe rely on technology to conduct our business, and our technology could become ineffective or obsolete.\nWe rely on technology, including geographic and seismic analysis techniques and economic models, to develop our reserve estimates and to guide our exploration, development and production activities. We and our operator partners will be required to continually enhance and update our technology to maintain its efficacy and to avoid obsolescence. The costs of doing so may be substantial and may be higher than the costs that we anticipate for technology maintenance and development. If we are unable to maintain the efficacy of our technology, our ability to manage our business and to compete may be impaired. Further, even if we are able to maintain technical effectiveness, our technology may not be the most efficient means of reaching our objectives, in which case we may incur higher operating costs than we would were our technology more efficient.\nThe loss of key personnel would directly affect our efficiency and profitability.\nOur future success, should the Arrangement not occur, is dependent, in a large part, on retaining the services of our current management team. Our executive officers possess a unique and comprehensive knowledge of our industry and related matters that are vital to our success within the industry. The knowledge, leadership and technical expertise of these individuals would be difficult to replace. The loss of one or more of our officers could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial performance, including our ability to develop and execute our long-term business strategy. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any employees. We do have employment agreements with each of our executive officers.\nWe have limited management and staff and are dependent upon partnering arrangements and third-party service providers.\nWe currently have four full-time employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The loss of these individuals would have an adverse effect on our business, as we have very limited personnel. We leverage the services of other independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, including engineering, oil and gas well planning and supervision, and land, legal, environmental and tax services. We also pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation, evaluation and prospect leasing. Our dependence on third-party consultants and service providers create a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed; and\n\u25cf the risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to its projects.\nIf we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or they perform poorly, our results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nOur officers and directors control a significant percentage of our current outstanding common stock and their interests may conflict with those of our stockholders.\nAs of the date of this report, our executive officers and directors collectively and beneficially own approximately 16.1% of our outstanding common stock (see Item 12 of this report for an explanation of how this number is computed). This concentration of voting control gives these affiliates substantial influence over any matters which require a stockholder vote, including without limitation the election of directors and approval of merger and/or acquisition transactions, even if their interests may conflict with those of other stockholders. It could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the then prevailing market prices for their shares of common stock.\nIn the future, we may incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management may be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nIn the future, we may incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses as a result of operating as a public company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these new rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In performing this evaluation and testing, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2020. Our continued compliance with Section 404, will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We do not have an internal audit group. We have however, engaged independent professional assistance for the evaluation and testing of internal controls.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nTerrorist attacks or cyber-incidents could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nLike most companies, we have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, to operate our businesses, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our business partners, analyze mine and mining information, estimate quantities of coal reserves, as well as other activities related to our businesses. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist or cyber-attacks than other targets in the United States. Deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties, or cloud-based applications could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, other operational disruptions and third-party liability. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents.\nWe have adopted an Information Security Policy and Acceptable Use Statement to address precautions with respect to data security and we have created an Incident Response Plan which outlines appropriate responses in case of a reported breach. These policies and plan have been executed in coordination with our independent Information Technology Service provider.\nCertain Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nThere presently is a limited market for our common stock, and the price of our common stock may be volatile.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. There has been and may continue to be volatility in the volume and market price of our common stock moving forward. This volatility may be caused by a variety of factors, including the lack of readily available quotations, the absence of consistent administrative supervision of \u201cbid\u201d and \u201cask\u201d quotations, and generally lower trading volume. In addition, factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, or our failure to meet our or their projected financial and operating results, litigation involving us, factors relating to the oil and gas industry, actions by governmental agencies, national economic and stock market considerations, as well as other events and circumstances beyond our control could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock and the relative volatility of such market price.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our shares of common stock and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our shares of common stock.\nThe trading market for our shares of common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about our business and our shares of common stock. We do not have any control over these analysts. If securities analysts do not cover our shares of common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of those shares. If securities analysts do cover our shares of common stock, they could issue reports or recommendations that are unfavorable to the price of our shares of common stock, and they could downgrade a previously favorable report or recommendation, and in either case our share prices could decline as a result of the report. If one or more of these analysts does not initiate coverage, ceases to cover our shares of common stock or fails to publish regular reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share prices or trading volume to decline.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur stockholders could sell substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, including shares sold upon the filing of a registration statement that registers such shares and/or upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), if available, or upon the expiration of trading limitation periods. Such volume could create a circumstance commonly referred to as a market \u201coverhang\u201d and in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. Additionally, we have a large number of warrants that are presently exercisable. The exercise of a large amount of these securities followed by the subsequent sale of the underlying stock in the market would likely have a negative effect on our common stock\u2019s market price. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to secure additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nOur directors and officers have rights to indemnification.\nOur Bylaws provide, as permitted by governing Nevada law, that we will indemnify our directors, officers, and employees, whether or not then in service as such, against all reasonable expenses actually and necessarily incurred by him or her in connection with the defense of any litigation to which the individual may have been made a party because he or she is or was a director, officer, or employee of the company. The inclusion of these provisions in the Bylaws may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends, if any, would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements, and general financial condition. The payment of any dividends will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors. We presently intend to retain all earnings, if any, to implement our business strategy; accordingly, we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nNASDAQ may delist our common stock from trading on its exchange, which could limit shareholders\u2019 ability to trade our common stock.\nAs a listed company on NASDAQ, we are required to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our common stock. If we fail to meet these continued listing requirements, our common stock may be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.\nIssuance of our stock in the future could dilute existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have the authority to issue up to 150,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. We are authorized to issue significant amounts of common stock in the future, subject only to the discretion of our board of directors. These future issuances could be at values substantially below the price paid for our common stock by investors. In addition, we could issue large blocks of our stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further shareholder approval. Because the trading volume of our common stock is relatively low, the issuance of our stock may have a disproportionately large impact on its price compared to larger companies.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future. By way of example, on January 4, 2021, the price of our common stock closed at $0.71 per share while on February 16, 2021, our stock price closed at $4.29 per share. We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition, the recent outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. The stock market in general and the market for companies such as ours in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf investor reaction to our business strategy;\n\u25cf the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf our continued compliance with the NASDAQ listing standards;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products;\n\u25cf actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our products, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf the success of our efforts to acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates;\n\u25cf developments concerning our collaborations or partners;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our products;\n\u25cf our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u25cf declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u25cf trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf actual or purported \u201cshort-squeeze\u201d trading activity;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - continued\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers or result in political or economic instability.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, recent increases are significantly inconsistent with any improvements in actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or other indicators of value. Since the stock price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past, has been recently volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current levels or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.\nAdditionally, securities of certain companies have recently experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in both the stock prices of those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment, as in many cases the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that we won\u2019t be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nThe issuance of preferred stock in the future could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nAn issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could, upon conversion or otherwise, have all of the rights of our common stock. Our board of directors\u2019 authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve.", "PERMNO": 14358, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "TRCH"}
