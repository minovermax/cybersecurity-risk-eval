{"cik": "1001258", "company": "ASTA FUNDING INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nNote Regarding Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors below in evaluating us. In addition to the following risks, there may also be risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial that may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operation or financial condition could be adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and stockholders might lose all or part of their investment. The risk factors presented below are those which we currently consider material. However, they are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, may also adversely affect us. There may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us, and our analysis might be wrong. If any of the risks that we face actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forward-looking statements that we have made or might make. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nThe enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation, and we cannot predict the effect of such regulation on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities.\nGiven the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented, in their entirety, by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of business activities, require changes to certain business practices, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In particular, the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively, include, among others:\n\u2022\nincreased cost of operations due to greater regulatory oversight, supervision and compliance with consumer debt issuance and collection practices; and\n\u2022\nthe limitation on the ability to expand consumer product and service offerings due to anticipated stricter consumer protection laws and regulations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act establishes the CFPB, which has broad regulatory powers over debt collectors and virtually all other \u201ccovered persons\u201d who have any connection to consumer financial products or services. The CFPB has exclusive rule-making authority with respect to all significant federal statutes that impact the collection industry, including the FDCPA, the FCRA, and others. This means, for example, that the CFPB has the ability to pass rules and regulations that interpret any of the provisions of the FDCPA, potentially impacting all facets of the collection channel. Federal agencies, including the CFPB, have been given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations that will implement the Dodd-Frank Act. Consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time. In addition, this legislation mandated multiple studies and reports for Congress, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action.\nThe CFPB has the authority to conduct periodic examinations of \u201clarger participants\u201d in each market, and we believe it is likely that we will be subject to an examination.\nWe cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, the effect such regulations will have on financial markets generally, or on our businesses specifically, the additional\ncosts associated with compliance with such regulations, or any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nGovernment regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our receivables.\nFederal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances may limit our ability to recover and enforce our rights with respect to the receivables acquired by us. These laws include, but are not limited to, the following federal statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder and comparable statutes in states where consumers reside and/or where creditors are located:\n\u2022\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act;\n\u2022\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act;\n\u2022\nThe Truth-In-Lending Act;\n\u2022\nThe Fair Credit Billing Act;\n\u2022\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act;\n\u2022\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act;\n\u2022\nThe Financial Privacy Rule;\n\u2022\nThe Safeguards Rule;\n\u2022\nTelephone Consumer Protection Act;\n\u2022\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d)/Health Information Technology for Economical and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d);\n\u2022\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code; and\n\u2022\nCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009.\nWe may be precluded from collecting receivables we purchase where the creditor or other previous owner or third-party collection agency or attorney failed to comply with applicable law in originating or servicing such acquired receivables. Laws relating to the collection of consumer debt also directly apply to our business. Our failure to comply with any laws applicable to us, including state licensing laws, could limit our ability to recover on receivables and could subject us to fines and penalties, which could reduce our earnings and result in a default under our loan arrangements. In addition, our third-party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these and other laws and their failure to comply with such laws could also materially adversely affect our finance income and earnings.\nAdditional laws or amendments to existing laws may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables. Such new laws or amendments may adversely affect the ability to collect on our receivables, which could also adversely affect our finance income and earnings.\nBecause our receivables are generally originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal, state and/or local laws by a variety of entities and may involve consumers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and South America, there can be no assurance that all originating and servicing entities have, at all times, been in substantial compliance with applicable law. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we or our third-party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law. Failure to comply with applicable law could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs, fines and penalties.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. These entities, including PCAOB, the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Market, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress.\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with our litigation funding business.\nRisks of the litigation funding business include the potential regulation or limitation of interest rates and other fees advanced by our litigation funding subsidiaries under federal and/or state regulation, a change in statutory or case law which limits or restricts the ability of our litigation funding subsidiaries to charge or collect fees and interest at anticipated levels, claimants being unsuccessful in whole or in part in the personal injury claims or divorce settlement upon which our funds are provided, the continued services of the senior management of our litigation funding subsidiaries to source and analyze cases in accordance with the subsidiaries\u2019 respective underwriting guidelines.\nWe are subject to various risks in connection with our structured settlement funding business.\nRisks of the structured settlement funding business include the potential regulation that could stem from the Dodd Frank Act, state regulation and/or any other change in statutory or case law which may limit or restrict the ability of our structured settlement business to: make investments; the effectiveness of our marketing programs; and our ability to continue to grow the volume of structured settlements. Competition in the marketplace could drive up the purchase price of structured settlement and annuity receivables. Additionally, the fact that one company controls at least 50% of the marketplace means that other players, including us, may be negatively impacted by strategic decisions employed by this competitor. Our failure or inability to execute any element of our business strategy and/or increased competition in the marketplace could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility risk as interest rates can fluctuate in the period between when we purchase structured settlements payment streams and when we securitize such payment streams.\nWe purchase structured settlements at a discount rate based on, among other factors, our then estimates of the future interest rate environment. Once a critical mass of payment streams is achieved, those payment streams are then securitized, generally through fixed rate private placements. The discount rate at which our securitization is sold to investors is based on the current interest rates as of the time of the securitization. Interest rates may fluctuate significantly during the period between the purchase and securitization of payment streams, which can increase or decrease the spread between the discount rate at which we purchase the payment streams and the discount rate at which we securitize such payment streams, which could increase or decrease our revenues. Volatile interest rate environments can lead to volatility in our results of operations. If we are unable to finance the payment streams we purchase at a discount rate that is sufficiently lower than the discount rate at which we make such purchases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various risks in connection to our disability advocacy business.\nWe have recently entered the disability advocacy business and are subject to all of the risks inherent in a new business. We are incurring substantial start-up costs and there can be no assurance this business segment will become profitable in the future. Risks of the disability advocacy business include the competition of other advocacy firms, statutory cut backs on the Federal Disability program and stricter guidelines in qualifying for disability benefits.\nWe may not be able to purchase consumer receivable portfolios domestically and internationally at favorable prices or on sufficiently favorable terms if at all.\nOur success in this business segment depends upon the continued availability of consumer receivable portfolios that meet our purchasing criteria and our ability to identify and finance the purchases of such portfolios. The availability of consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices and on terms acceptable to us, if at all, depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe growth in consumer debt;\n\u2022\nthe volume of consumer receivable portfolios available for sale;\n\u2022\navailability of financing to fund purchases;\n\u2022\ncompetitive factors affecting potential purchasers and sellers of consumer receivable portfolios; and\n\u2022\npossible future changes in the bankruptcy laws, state laws and homestead acts which could make it more difficult for us to collect.\n\u2022\nThe foreign exchange rate changes of the countries in which we do business\nThere is no assurance that we will realize the full value of the deferred tax asset.\nAlthough the carry forward period for income taxes is up to twenty years, such allowance period is outside a reasonable period to forecast full realization of the deferred tax asset. We continually monitor forecast information to ensure the valuation allowance is appropriate.\nWe may not be able to collect sufficient amounts on our consumer receivable portfolios to recover the costs associated with the purchase of those portfolios and to fund our operations.\nWe acquire (internationally) and collect on consumer receivable portfolios that contain charged-off receivables. In order to operate profitably over the long term, we must continually purchase (internationally) and collect on a sufficient volume of receivables to generate revenue that exceeds our purchase costs. For accounts that are charged-off or semi-performing, the originators or interim owners of the receivables generally have:\n\u2022\nmade numerous attempts to collect on these obligations, often using both their in-house collection staff and third-party collection agencies; and\n\u2022\nsubsequently deemed these obligations as uncollectible.\nThese receivable portfolios are purchased internationally at significant discounts to the amount the consumers owe. These receivables are difficult to collect and actual recoveries may be less than the amount expected. In addition, our collections may worsen in a weak economic cycle. We may not recover amounts in excess of our acquisition and servicing costs.\nOur ability to recover the purchase costs on our portfolios and produce sufficient returns can be negatively impacted by the quality of the purchased receivables. In the normal course of our portfolio acquisitions, some receivables may be included in the portfolios that fail to conform to certain terms of the purchase agreements and we may seek to return these receivables to the seller for payment or replacement receivables. However, we cannot guarantee that any of such sellers will be able to meet their payment obligations to us. Accounts that we are unable to return to sellers may yield no return. If cash flows from operations are less than anticipated as a result of our inability to collect sufficient amounts on our receivables, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, purchase new portfolios, and achieve future growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to competition for the purchase of international consumer receivable portfolios which may result in an increase in prices of such portfolios.\nWe compete with other purchasers of consumer receivable portfolios, with third-party collection agencies and with financial services companies that manage their own consumer receivable portfolios. We compete on the basis of price, reputation, industry experience and performance. Some of our competitors have greater capital, personnel and other resources than we have. The possible entry of new competitors, including competitors that historically have focused on the acquisition of different asset types, and the expected increase in competition from current market participants may reduce our access to consumer receivable portfolios. Aggressive pricing by our competitors has raised the price of consumer receivable portfolios above levels that we are willing to pay, which could reduce the number of consumer receivable portfolios suitable for us to purchase or if purchased by us, reduce the profits, if any, generated by such portfolios. If we are unable to purchase receivable portfolios at favorable prices or at all, our finance income and earnings could be materially reduced.\nWe depend upon third parties to service a significant portion of our domestic and international consumer receivable portfolios. The loss of certain servicers could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation.\nAs 38% of our portfolio face value is serviced by five organizations domestically, we are dependent upon the efforts of these collection agencies and attorneys to service and collect our consumer receivables. Any failure by our third-party collection agencies and attorneys to adequately perform collection services for us or remit such collections to us could materially reduce our finance income and our profitability. In addition, our finance income and profitability could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to secure replacement third party collection agencies and attorneys and redirect payments from the customers to our new third party collection agencies and attorneys promptly in the event our agreements with our third-party collection agencies and attorneys are terminated, our third-party collection agencies and attorneys fail to adequately perform their obligations or if our relationships with such third-party collection agencies and attorneys adversely change.\nWe may rely on third parties to locate, identify and evaluate international consumer receivable portfolios available for purchase.\nWe may rely on third parties, including brokers and third-party collection agencies and attorneys, to identify consumer receivable portfolios and, in some instances, to assist us in our evaluation and purchase of these portfolios. As a result, if such third parties fail to identify receivable portfolios or if our relationships with such third parties are not maintained, our ability to identify and purchase additional receivable portfolios could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we, or such parties, fail to correctly or adequately evaluate the value or collectability of these consumer receivable portfolios, we may pay too much for such portfolios and suffer an impairment, which would negatively impact our earnings.\nWe rely on our third party collectors to comply with all rules and regulations and maintain proper internal controls over their accounting and operations.\nBecause the receivables were originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal and/or state laws by a variety of entities and involved consumers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Panama, Puerto Rico, Columbia and Peru, there can be no assurance that all original servicing entities have, at all times, been in substantial compliance with applicable law. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we or our third-party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law. The failure to comply with applicable law and not maintain proper controls in their accounting and operations could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs, fines and penalties.\nOur collections may decrease if bankruptcy filings increase.\nDuring times of economic uncertainty, the amount of defaulted consumer receivables generally increases, which contributes to an increase in the amount of personal bankruptcy filings. Under certain bankruptcy filings, a debtor\u2019s assets are sold to repay credit originators, but since the defaulted consumer receivables we purchase are generally unsecured, we may not be able to collect on those receivables. Our collections may decline with an increase in bankruptcy filings. If our actual collection experience with respect to a defaulted consumer receivable portfolio is significantly lower than we projected when we purchased the portfolio, our earnings could be negatively affected.\nThe loss of any of our executive officers may adversely affect our operations and our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios.\nOur executive officers are responsible for making substantially all management decisions, including determining which portfolios to purchase, the purchase price and other material terms of such portfolio acquisitions. These decisions are instrumental to the success of our business. Significant losses of the services of our executive officers or the inability to replace our officers with individuals who have experience in the industry or with the Company could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios.\nThe Stern family effectively controls the Company, substantially reducing the influence of our other stockholders.\nMembers of the Stern family own directly or indirectly, approximately 32% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of September 30, 2015. As a result, the Stern family is able to significantly influence the actions that require stockholder approval, including:\n\u2022\nthe election of our directors; and\n\u2022\nthe approval of mergers, sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval.\nAs a result, our other stockholders may have reduced influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. In addition, the Stern family\u2019s influence could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and, consequently, materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nNegative press regarding the debt collection industry may have a negative impact on a customer\u2019s willingness to pay the debt we acquire.\nConsumers are exposed to information from a number of sources that may cause them to be more reluctant to pay their debts or to pursue legal actions against us. Online, print and other media publish stories about the debt collection industry which cite specific examples of abusive collection practices. These stories can lead to the rapid dissemination of the story, adding to the level of exposure to negative publicity about our industry. Various Internet sites are maintained where consumers can list their concerns about the activities of debt collectors and seek guidance from other website posters on how to handle the situation. Advertisements by debt relief attorneys and credit counseling centers are becoming more common, adding to the negative attention given to our industry. As a result of this negative publicity, customers may be more reluctant to pay their debts or could pursue legal action against us regardless of whether those actions are warranted. These actions could impact our ability to collect on the receivables we acquire and affect our revenues and profitability.\nClass action suits and other litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention from operating our business and increase our expenses.\nOriginators, debt purchasers and third-party collection agencies and attorneys in the consumer credit industry are frequently subject to putative class action lawsuits and other litigation. Claims include failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and improper or deceptive origination and servicing practices. Being a defendant in such class action lawsuits or other litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may seek to make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources.\nWe may seek to grow through acquisitions of related businesses in the financial services sector. Such acquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance, including:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our everyday business activities;\n\u2022\nthe assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of, and other unanticipated problems arising in, the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nthe need to expand management, administration and operational systems.\nIf we make such acquisitions, we cannot predict whether:\n\u2022\nwe will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses into our business;\n\u2022\nwe will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nthere will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions.\nIn addition, future acquisitions by us may result in:\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of additional debt; and\n\u2022\nthe recognition of significant charges for depreciation and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nIf our technology infrastructure is not operational, our operations could be disrupted and our ability to successfully operate the business could be compromised.\nOur success depends, in part, on sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems. The temporary loss of our computer or telecommunications systems, through casualty, operating malfunction or service provider failure, could disrupt our operations. In addition, we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly bid on prospective acquisitions of receivable portfolios and to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for our collection and monitoring activities. Any failure of our information systems and their backup systems would interrupt our operations. We may not have adequate backup arrangements for all of our operations and we may incur significant losses if an outage occurs. In addition, we rely on third-party collection agencies and attorneys who also may be adversely affected in the event of an outage in which the third-party collection agencies and attorneys do not have adequate backup arrangements. Any interruption in our operations or our third-party collection agencies\u2019 and attorneys\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. However, we are in the process of implementing a disaster recovery program which would mitigate this risk.\nA cyber security incident could have a negative effect on our business as we outsource a significant amount of the collection accounts with personal information electronically.\nA security breach could have a detrimental effect on our business as we maintain a significant amount of personal information in our electronic files. A breach of our system or a leak of the personal information we maintain could leave us vulnerable to, among other things, loss of information and potential litigation each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur organizational documents and Delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our board of directors and management.\nSeveral provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock. Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. The ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current board of directors. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires 15% or more of our common stock.\nWe have adopted a stockholder rights plan which could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us.\nWe adopted a stockholder rights plan which is intended to protect us from efforts to obtain control of us that are inconsistent with our best interests and the interests of our stockholders. The rights will be exercisable ten days following the earlier of the public announcement that a stockholder has acquired 20% or more of our common stock without board approval or the announcement of a tender offer which results in the ownership of 20% or more of our common stock. If the rights become exercisable, all rights holders (other than the person triggering the rights) will be entitled to acquire our securities at a substantial discount. Because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take over the Company without the approval of our board of directors, the rights plan could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock, without first negotiating with the board of directors.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our affiliates or other stockholders may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. We had 12,070,373 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 8, 2015. Of these shares, 4,196,806 are owned by our affiliates. In addition, options to purchase 1,043,566 shares of our common stock were outstanding as of September 30, 2015, of which 860,891 were exercisable. We may also issue additional shares in connection with our business and may grant additional stock options or restricted shares to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our present or future equity compensation plans or we may issue warrants to third parties outside of such plans. As of September 30, 2015, there were 1,511,179 shares available for such purpose with such shares available under the 2012 Stock Option and Performance Award Plan. If a significant portion of these shares were sold in the public market, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe have the ability to issue preferred shares, warrants, convertible debt and other securities without stockholder approval which could dilute the relative ownership interest of current stockholders and adversely affect our share price.\nFuture sales of our equity-related securities in the public market, including sales of our common stock pursuant to our shelf-registration statement, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings. Our common shares may be subordinate to classes of preferred shares issued in the future in the payment of dividends and other distributions made with respect to common shares, including distributions upon liquidation or dissolution. Our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue preferred shares without first obtaining stockholder approval. If we issued preferred shares, these additional securities may have dividend or liquidation preferences senior to our common shares. If we issue convertible preferred shares, a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders\u2019 interest. We have similar abilities to issue convertible debt, warrants and other equity securities.\nClimate change and related regulatory responses may adversely impact our business.\nClimate change as a result of emissions of greenhouse gases is a significant topic of discussion and may generate federal and other regulatory responses in the near future, including the imposition of a so-called \u201ccap and trade\u201d system. It is impracticable to predict with any certainty the impact on our business of climate change or the regulatory responses to it, although we recognize that they could be significant. The most direct impact is likely to be an increase in energy costs, which would increase slightly our operating costs, primarily through increased utility and transportations costs. In addition, increased energy costs could impact consumers and their ability to incur and repay indebtedness. However, it is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact, either directionally or quantitatively, of climate change and related regulatory responses.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline.\nBecause of the nature of our business, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our results may fluctuate as a result of any of the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of collections on our consumer receivable portfolios;\n\u2022\nour inability to identify and acquire additional consumer receivable portfolios;\n\u2022\na decline in the estimated future value of our consumer receivable portfolio recoveries;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating expenses associated with the growth of our operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral and economic market conditions; and\n\u2022\nPrices we are willing to pay for consumer receivable portfolios.", "PERMNO": 82552, "SIC": 6153, "TIC": "ASFI"}
