{"cik": "1394159", "company": "Orbitz Worldwide, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe proposed merger is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder approvals, as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when the merger may be completed.\nAs previously announced, on February 12, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Expedia, Inc. and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Expedia, under which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Expedia. The consummation of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other regulatory clearances, the absence of any governmental order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and compliance with the covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement. If these conditions to the closing of the Merger are not fulfilled, then the Merger cannot be consummated. Several of these required closing conditions are not within Orbitz\u2019s control, including regulatory approval, and we cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise. If the Merger does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearances, or if another event occurs that delays or prevents the Merger, such delay or failure to complete the Merger may cause uncertainty and other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect Orbitz\u2019s business, financial position, and results of operations.\nWe can give you no assurance that the Merger will be consummated, in which case we would not realize the anticipated benefits of having completed the Merger, which may adversely affect us. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of up to $57.5 million if the Merger is not consummated.\nWhile the Merger is pending, we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our operations and the future of our business or result in a loss of employees.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, customers and business partners may negatively impact the Company. These uncertainties could cause customers, business partners and other third parties to modify existing business relationships with the Company. Such uncertainty may also cause potential customers and business partners to decide not to pursue business or other relationships with Orbitz. Additionally, these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract and retain key personnel until the Merger is completed as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key or a high number of employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty, the perceived difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, the Company\u2019s business could be negatively impacted. These factors, either individually or collectively, may negatively impact the financial performance of the Company pending the consummation of the merger.\nIn the event that the pending Merger with Expedia is not completed, the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results may be negatively impacted.\nAs noted above, the conditions to the completion of the Merger with Expedia may not be satisfied. If the Merger with Expedia is not completed for any reason, we would still be liable for significant transaction costs and the focus of our management would have been diverted from seeking other potential opportunities without realizing any benefits of the completed Merger. If we do not complete the Merger, the price of our common stock may decline significantly from the current market price, which may reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nIf the proposed Merger is not completed or we are not otherwise acquired, we may consider other strategic alternatives, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nIf the proposed Merger with Expedia is not completed, our Board of Directors will review and consider various alternatives available to us, including, among others, continuing as a public company with no material changes to our business or capital structure or other alternative transactions. Any alternative transaction may involve various additional risks to our business, including, among others, distraction of our management team and associated expenses similar to those described above in connection with the proposed Merger, our ability to consummate the alternative transaction, the valuation assigned to our business in the alternative transaction, our ability or a potential buyer\u2019s ability to access capital on acceptable terms or at all and other variables that may adversely affect our operations.\nThe travel industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to effectively compete in the future.\nWe operate in the highly competitive travel industry. Our success depends upon our ability to compete effectively against numerous established and emerging competitors, including other OTCs, traditional offline travel companies, suppliers, travel research companies, search engines and meta-search companies, which may have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. Factors affecting our competitive success include price, availability of travel products, ability to package travel products across multiple suppliers, brand recognition, customer service and customer care, fees charged to customers, ease of use, accessibility, reliability and innovation. If we are not able to compete effectively against our competitors, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOnline travel companies: We face significant competition from other online travel companies, such as Priceline, Expedia, Faceportal, TripAdvisor and their related brands, as well as other regional competitors such as Odigeo, Bravofly and e-travel.ie in Europe. We compete with offline travel companies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply.\nTravel suppliers: Suppliers have increasingly focused on distributing their products through their own websites and driving consumers away from OTCs. Suppliers may offer advantages for customers to book directly, such as member-only fares, bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to customers. Some low-cost airlines distribute their online supply exclusively through their own website and other airlines have stopped providing inventory to certain online channels and attempt to drive customers to book directly on their websites by eliminating or limiting sales of certain airline tickets through third-party distributors. Additionally, airline suppliers are increasingly promoting hotel supply on their websites in connection with airline tickets. Our results of operations could be negatively affected by such increased competitive pressure from suppliers.\nSearch engines: We also face increasing competition from search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo!. Search engines have grown in popularity and may offer comprehensive travel planning or shopping capabilities, which may drive more traffic directly to the websites of suppliers or competitors. Google has increased its focus on appealing to travel customers through its launches of Google Places, Google Flights and Google Hotel Price Ads (\u201cHPA\u201d). Google\u2019s efforts around these products, as well as possible future developments, may change or undermine our ability to obtain prominent placement in paid or unpaid search results at a reasonable cost or at all. In addition, we currently license our search functionality, QPX Software, from ITA Software, Inc., a subsidiary of Google.\nTravel meta-search engines and content aggregators: Travel meta-search websites and travel research sites that have search functionality, including Kayak.com (a subsidiary of our competitor Priceline), Trivago.com (a subsidiary of our competitor Expedia), and TripAdvisor, aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier, travel agent and other websites. If these competitors limit our participation within their results, it could affect our traffic-generating arrangements in a negative manner. For example, our agreement with Kayak.com that provided for exclusivity with respect to some of Kayak\u2019s core search results terminated at the end of 2013 and was not renewed. In addition, some meta-search sites, including Kayak.com, offer users the ability to make reservations directly on their websites, which may reduce the amount of traffic and transactions available to us through referrals from these sites. If additional meta-search sites begin to offer the ability to make reservations directly, that will further affect our ability to generate traffic to our sites.\nOther competitors in the broader travel space: We also will continue to face competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as one part of their business model, such as Amazon and Alibaba, \u201cdaily deal\u201d websites, such as Groupon Getaways, or peer-to-peer inventory sources, such as AirBnB and HomeAway. AirBnB and similar websites facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms. The growth of peer-to-peer inventory sources could affect the demand for our services in facilitating reservations at hotels.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against any current and future competitors or on emerging platforms, or provide differentiated products and services to our customer base. Increasing competition from current and emerging competitors, the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies, such as meta-search and other search engine technologies, may force us to make changes to our business models, which could affect our financial performance and liquidity. Increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins, as well as loss of customer, transactions and brand recognition.\nOur business depends on our supplier and distribution partner relationships. Adverse changes in these relationships or our inability to enter into new relationships could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and reduce our revenue.\nWe rely significantly on our relationships with hotels, airlines and other suppliers and travel partners. We enter into agreements with these suppliers and travel partners at varying times and of varying duration. As a result, at any given point in time, one or more of these agreements may be approaching expiration or renewal. Moreover, in order to enhance the competitiveness of our offerings, we are constantly seeking to add new suppliers and travel partners. Adverse changes in any of these relationships (whether upon expiration of an agreement or otherwise) or the inability to enter into new relationships could negatively impact the availability and competitiveness of the travel products we offer on our websites and therefore could adversely affect our revenue. If any of our major suppliers or travel partners significantly reduces their business with us for a sustained period of time or completely withdraws from doing business with us, in favor of one of our competitors or to require consumers to purchase services directly from them, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to retain customers.\nOur suppliers continue to look for ways to decrease their overall distribution costs, which could significantly reduce the net revenue OTCs earn from travel and other travel-related products. As a result, the revenue we and other OTCs earn in the form of mark-ups and commissions from our suppliers is likely to be negatively impacted over the long term as supplier contracts are extended or renegotiated or as we add new suppliers. In particular, airlines continue to look for ways to decrease their overall costs, including the cost of distributing airline tickets through OTCs and GDSs, and to increase their control over distribution. The airlines have negotiated, and we expect they will continue to attempt to negotiate, terms more favorable to themselves whenever possible. To the extent airlines obtain more favorable terms in their agreements with us (which has been a continuing trend for many years) or in their agreements with the GDSs that we use, or if an airline terminates its agreement with us, the net revenue we earn from the distribution of airline tickets would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, although we have recently negotiated new GDS service agreements with more favorable terms than our prior GDS contract, there can be no assurance that the revenue we earn in the form of incentive payments from GDS providers will not be negatively impacted in future contract negotiations.\nBecause we depend on a relatively small number of airlines and car rental companies for a significant portion of our revenue in those areas, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by further consolidation of suppliers in either of these industries. Further consolidation would force the Company to negotiate with a fewer number of total suppliers for the same number of segments, which would weaken our negotiating position and reduce our ability to negotiate favorable rates on segments. Additionally, further consolidation in the airline industry could result in a reduction in the number of airline tickets available for booking on our websites and increased air fares, which may have a negative impact on demand for travel.\nDisruptions or prolonged declines in travel volume, particularly air travel, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue is derived from the worldwide travel industry and is directly related to the overall level of travel activity, particularly air travel and hotel volume. Therefore, our revenue is significantly impacted by declines in or disruptions to travel in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region due to factors entirely outside of our control. Factors that could affect travel activity and materially adversely impact our results of operations, business and revenue include:\n\u2022\ndeterioration, weakness or uncertainty in the global economy;\n\u2022\nglobal security issues, political instability, acts or threats of terrorism, regional hostilities or war, and other political issues that could adversely affect travel volume in our key regions;\n\u2022\nhealth-related concerns, such as epidemics or pandemics;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and droughts;\n\u2022\nsevere weather conditions, or unusual or unpredictable weather patterns;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of suppliers, particularly those in the airline and hotel industry, and the impact of their financial condition on the cost and availability of air travel and hotel rooms;\n\u2022\nchanges in airline distribution policies or increases in airfares;\n\u2022\nchanges to regulations governing the airline and travel industry or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nan increase in fuel prices affecting travel;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or labor unrest at any of the major airlines, airports or major hotel chains;\n\u2022\ntravel-related accidents or safety concerns;\n\u2022\nincreased airport security that could reduce the convenience of air travel;\n\u2022\nchanges in occupancy and room rates achieved by hotels; and\n\u2022\ntravelers\u2019 perceptions of the occurrence of or the scope, severity and timing of the factors described above.\nIf there is a prolonged substantial decrease in travel volumes, particularly for air travel and hotel stays, for these or any other reasons, it would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on search engines, which may change their business models or search engine algorithms in ways that could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe use Google and other internet search engines to generate traffic to our websites, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords. Google and other search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search. These changes could negatively affect the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites. In addition, a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in pay-per-click and display advertising campaigns on search engines, social networking sites, meta-search sites and content properties. Pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can experience rapid change, both technically and competitively. Moreover, any of these providers could, for competitive or other purposes, alter their search algorithms or results, causing our websites to place lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of our websites or that of our third-party distribution partners, or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization, search engine marketing or other traffic generating arrangements in a negative manner, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected, potentially to a material extent.\nWe rely on third-party service providers who may experience disruptions in the services they provide to us or changes in their businesses, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe are dependent upon third-party systems and service providers, and any disruption or adverse change in their businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on certain third-party computer systems, service providers and software companies, including the electronic central reservation systems and GDSs. In particular, our businesses rely on third parties to:\n\u2022\nconduct searches for airfares;\n\u2022\nprocess hotel room transactions;\n\u2022\nprocess credit card and other payments; and\n\u2022\nprovide computer infrastructure critical to our business.\nWe currently utilize GDSs to process a significant portion of our bookings. In addition, we rely on a group of business process outsourcing companies located in various countries to provide us with call center and telesales services, back office administrative services such as ticketing fulfillment, hotel rate loading and quality control, information technology services, and financial services. Any interruption in these third-party services could prevent us from operating certain aspects of our business and damage our reputation. For instance, interruption or deterioration in our GDS partners\u2019 products or services could prevent us from searching and booking airline and car rental reservations.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to maintain relationships with our technology partners. In the event our arrangements with any of these third parties are impaired or terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, which could result in significant additional costs or disruptions to our business. In addition, some of our agreements with third-party service providers can be terminated by those parties on short notice and, in many cases, provide no recourse for service interruptions. A termination or disruption of these services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with data security and credit card fraud.\nThe secure transmission of confidential personal information over the Internet is essential in maintaining customer and supplier confidence in our services. Substantial or ongoing data security breaches, whether instigated internally or externally on our system or on other Internet-based systems, could significantly harm our business. It is possible that a party (whether internal or external) could circumvent our security measures to steal confidential personal information, which could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, and that we may be unsuccessful in implementing our remediation plan to address potential exposures. Data security breaches could also damage our reputation, causing customers, potential customers and suppliers to lose confidence in our data security, which could have a negative effect on the demand for our services. Additionally, we disclose to certain of our third-party service providers, including our GDS providers, our customers\u2019 credit card information in order to process transactions. If such third-party provider incurs a data security breach that causes our customers\u2019 credit card information to be compromised, we could face the same risks as we would to a breach on our own system, including risk of loss and litigation and damage to our reputation. Moreover, it\u2019s possible that public perception concerning security and privacy on the Internet generally could adversely affect customers\u2019 willingness to use the Internet, including our websites, as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Publicized breaches of security affecting other\ncompanies that conduct business over the Internet could cause consumers to be reluctant to use the Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions and therefore reduce the number of consumers using our websites to book travel.\nAdditionally, our results of operations have been negatively affected by purchases made using fraudulent credit cards and we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card information as payment for transactions in the future. Fraudulent schemes are becoming increasingly sophisticated and common, and our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods and new technology platforms. If we are unable to effectively combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites or if we otherwise experience increased levels of disputed credit card payments, our results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business has significant liquidity requirements.\nOur business has significant liquidity requirements. Certain events could have a negative impact on our liquidity, which in turn could affect our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or operate our business as it currently exists, including the following:\n\u2022\ntermination of a major supplier\u2019s participation on our websites;\n\u2022\ndecline in merchant gross bookings due to deteriorating economic conditions or other factors;\n\u2022\ndecline in stand-alone hotel merchant gross bookings due to a shift from the merchant model to the retail model;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of holdbacks or reserves by credit card and other payment processors;\n\u2022\nchanges to payment terms or other requirements imposed by vendors, suppliers, payment processors, consumer protection organizations, taxing authorities or regulatory agencies, such as requiring us to provide letters of credit, cash reserves, deposits or other forms of financial security or increases in such requirements; and\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated operating cash flows from our operations or other unanticipated events, such as unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings (including, in the case of hotel occupancy proceedings, certain jurisdictions\u2019 requirements that we provide financial security or pay a deposit to the municipality in order to challenge the assessment in court).\nIf any of these events occurs in the future, individually or in the aggregate, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our liquidity and the value of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could limit the manner in which we operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $447.8 million of outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement. Our substantial level of indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing or to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nreduce the funds available to us for potential acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes because we are required to use a portion of our cash flows from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nput us at a competitive disadvantage because we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors and reduce our flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in the economy or our industry, including increased competition; and\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nThe Amended Credit Agreement requires us not to exceed a maximum first lien leverage ratio. If we fail to comply with this covenant and we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, our lenders could accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility and could proceed against the collateral securing this indebtedness. If this were to occur, there is no assurance that alternative financing would be available to us or at favorable terms.\nIn addition, restrictive covenants in our Amended Credit Agreement specifically limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or enter into guarantees;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmake new investments, loans or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ngrant or incur liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nsell our assets;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmake distributions or dividend payments or redeem or repurchase our capital stock.\nAs a result, we may operate our business differently than if we were not subject to these covenants and restrictions.\nCertain of our international subsidiaries have a history of significant operating losses and our inability to improve their scale and profitability could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have historically incurred significant operating losses for some of our international subsidiaries and may continue to experience operating losses in the future. As a result, we have made, and may continue to make, significant investments in our international operations by using a portion of the cash flow generated from our domestic operations or funds from other borrowings under our other credit facilities. There can be no assurance that such international subsidiaries will be profitable in the future or that any profits generated by them will be sufficient to recover our investments in them.\nThe profitability of our international subsidiaries depends to a large extent on the scale of their operations. If we fail to achieve the desired scale, we may not be able to effectively compete in the global marketplace, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur international operations are subject to additional risks not usually encountered when doing business in the United States, including foreign exchange risk.\nWe generated 26% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, from our international operations and had employees in over 25 countries. We are subject to certain risks as a result of having international operations and operations in multiple countries generally, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing operations due to distance, time zones, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with establishing management infrastructure in various countries;\n\u2022\nreduced flexibility in our foreign staffing due to more onerous employment law obligations and restrictions;\n\u2022\ndifferences and unexpected changes in local regulatory requirements and exposure to local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nlimits on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\npreference of local populations for local providers;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of non-U.S. investments and earnings back to the United States, including withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ndiminished ability to comply with local legal and licensing requirements due to discriminatory practices against business operators based on nationality or place of establishment; and\n\u2022\ndiminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights.\nWe expect that our exposure to the foregoing risks will increase as we attempt to expand our international operations. To the extent we are not able to effectively mitigate or eliminate these risks, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, our international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international regulations, including, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K.\u2019s Bribery Act 2010. Any failure by us to adopt and continue to practice appropriate compliance procedures to ensure that our employees and agents comply with the FCPA and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could affect our ability to compete and harm our business.\nWe depend upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including technologies and systems utilized for reservations, communications, procurement and administrative systems. Certain of our businesses also utilize third-party fare search solutions and GDSs or other technologies. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer our customers enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. Our future success depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving industry standards while continuing to improve the performance and features of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings and the changing demands of the marketplace. In particular, we will need to commit additional financial, operational and technical resources in order to expand our systems and infrastructure to meet any potential increases in business volume.\nIn addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems, obtain new technologies and systems, or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost-effective manner. We may fail to achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system, or we may be unable to devote financial resources to new\ntechnologies and systems in the future. Furthermore, our use of this technology could be challenged by claims that we have infringed upon the patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others. If any of these events occur, our business could suffer.\nSystem interruptions and the lack of redundancy may cause us to lose customers or business opportunities.\nWe rely on computer and information technology systems to operate our business and process transactions. If we are unable to maintain and improve our information technology systems and infrastructure, we may experience extended system interruptions, which could significantly curtail our ability to conduct business, provide services to our customers and generate revenue. System interruptions may include slow delivery times, unreliable service levels, prolonged or frequent service outages, or insufficient capacity in our systems and the systems of critical third parties on which we rely. In addition to the risks associated with inadequate maintenance or upgrading, our information technologies and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes, including:\n\u2022\npower losses, computer systems failure, Internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses and corruption of data, and similar events;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses, penetration by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other physical or electronic breaches of security;\n\u2022\nthe failure of third-party systems or services that we rely upon to maintain our own operations; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, war and acts of terrorism.\nAlthough we have identified and tested redundancy of critical systems and services in an effort to mitigate the above noted risks, it is possible that our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in the face of these threats. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption, and remediation may be costly and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Any extended interruption in our technologies or systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and financial performance could be negatively impacted by adverse tax events.\nNew sales, use, occupancy or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Such enactments could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. These events could require us to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us to pay fees, penalties and/or interest for past amounts deemed to be due. In addition, our revenue may decline because we may have to charge more for our services.\nNew, changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could also increase our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our products or services. Further, these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nWe and other providers of travel in the online travel industry are currently subject to various lawsuits related to hotel occupancy tax in numerous jurisdictions in the United States, and other jurisdictions may be considering similar lawsuits. An adverse ruling in the existing hotel occupancy tax cases could require us to pay tax retroactively and prospectively, and possibly penalties, interest and/or fees. We have also been contacted by several municipalities or other taxing bodies concerning our possible obligation with respect to local hotel occupancy or related taxes, and certain municipalities have begun audit proceedings and some have issued assessments against us. If we are found to be subject to the hotel occupancy tax ordinance by a taxing authority and we appeal the decision in court, certain jurisdictions may attempt to require us to provide financial security or pay the assessment to the municipality in order to challenge the tax assessment in court. The proliferation of new hotel occupancy tax cases or audit proceedings could result in substantial additional defense costs. These events could also adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nOur businesses are regulated and any failure to comply with applicable regulations or any changes in those regulations could adversely affect us.\nWe operate in a regulated industry both in the United States and internationally. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or the enactment of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, which could decrease demand for our products and services, increase costs or subject us to additional liabilities. Moreover, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, these regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current\nregulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, the various regulatory regimes to which we are subject may conflict so that compliance with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may create regulatory issues in another.\nBecause we process, store and use customer information, we are subject to additional risks as a result of governmental regulation and conflicting legal requirements regarding customer information. In the processing of customer transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information. This information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. This legislation and regulation is generally intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information, including credit card information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. If domestic or international legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, we could be adversely affected. Travel companies have also been subjected to investigations, lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of passenger information. As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel data. These and other privacy concerns could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is also subject to laws and regulations relating to our revenue generating and marketing activities, including those prohibiting unfair and deceptive advertising or practices. Our travel services are subject to regulation and laws governing the offer of travel products and services, including laws requiring us to register as a \u201cseller of travel\u201d in various jurisdictions and to comply with certain disclosure requirements. As an OTC that offers customers the ability to book air travel in the United States, we are also subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation, which has authority to enforce economic regulations and may assess civil penalties or challenge our operating authority.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes, which could affect our financial position.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, in particular patent infringement claims against us, tax disputes throughout the United States, employment law and other negligence, breach of contract and fraud claims, which involve claims, in the aggregate, for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations. The defense of these actions is both time consuming and expensive. In addition, historically, our insurers have reimbursed us for a significant portion of costs we incurred to defend cases related to use or occupancy tax of hotel accommodations that some states and localities impose (\u201chotel occupancy tax\u201d). We will not receive any additional insurance reimbursements in future periods as our insurance coverage has now been exhausted. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur. While we generally cannot estimate our range of loss, except for tax matters, if any of these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not be effectively protecting our intellectual property, which would allow competitors to duplicate our products and services. This could make it more difficult for us to compete with them.\nOur success and ability to compete depend, in part, upon our technology and other intellectual property, including our brands. Among our significant assets are our software and other proprietary information and intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and patent laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect these assets. However, we have a limited number of patents, and our software and related documentation are protected principally under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection, and the laws of some jurisdictions provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the United States. We have granted Travelport an exclusive license to our supplier link technology, including our patents related to that technology. Under the exclusive license, Travelport has the first right to enforce those patents, and so we will only be able to bring actions to enforce those patents if Travelport declines to do so. Unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the legal remedies available to us may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by unauthorized use.\nFurther, intellectual property challenges have been increasingly brought against members of the travel industry. These legal actions have in the past, and might in the future, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, we may need to take legal action in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, and these enforcement actions could result in the invalidation or other impairment of intellectual property rights we assert.\nOur ability to attract, train and retain executives and other qualified employees is critical to our results of operations and future growth.\nWe depend substantially on the continued services and performance of our key executives, senior management and skilled personnel, particularly our professionals with experience in our industry and our information technology and systems. Any of these individuals may choose to terminate their employment with us at any time. The specialized skills we require can be difficult and time-consuming to acquire and, as a result, these skills are often in short supply. A significant period of time and expense may be required to hire and train replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart the Company. Our inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by, for example, delaying our ability to bring new products and services to market or impairing the success of our operations or prospects for future growth.\nWe have granted Travelport perpetual licenses to use certain of our intellectual property, which could facilitate Travelport\u2019s ability to compete with us.\nWe are party to a Master License Agreement with Travelport under which we and Travelport each have rights to use certain of the other\u2019s intellectual property. The Master License Agreement permits Travelport and its affiliates to use and, in some cases, to sublicense to third parties certain of our intellectual property, including:\n\u2022\nour supplier link technology;\n\u2022\nportions of ebookers\u2019 booking, search and vacation package technologies;\n\u2022\ncertain of our products and online booking tools for corporate travel;\n\u2022\nportions of our private label vacation package technology; and\n\u2022\nour extranet supplier connectivity functionality.\nTravelport and its affiliates may use these technologies as part of, or in support of, their own products or services, including in some cases to compete directly with us.\nThe Master License Agreement permits Travelport to sublicense our intellectual property (other than our supplier link technology) to a party that is not an affiliate of Travelport, except that Travelport may not sublicense our intellectual property to a third-party for a use that competes with our business, unless Travelport incorporates or uses our intellectual property with Travelport products or services to enhance or improve Travelport products or services (other than to provide our intellectual property to third parties on a stand-alone basis). Travelport and its affiliates are permitted to use our intellectual property to provide their own products and services to third parties that compete with us. With respect to our supplier link technology, Travelport has an unrestricted license. These Travelport rights could facilitate Travelport\u2019s, its affiliates\u2019 and third parties\u2019 ability to compete with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.", "PERMNO": 92183, "SIC": 4700, "TIC": "OWW"}
