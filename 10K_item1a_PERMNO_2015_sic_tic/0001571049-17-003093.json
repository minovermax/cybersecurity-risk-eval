You should carefully consider the following information about these risks before buying shares of our common stock. If any of these risks occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the Annual Report) or incorporated herein by reference, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements. See also Forward-Looking Statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of losses and are uncertain as to our future profitability.\nWe have had mixed success with regard to generating net income. After generating net income in each of the years 2011 to 2014, we have incurred net losses in 2015 and 2016. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we began to concentrate on selling higher margin, integrated managed service subscriptions that include the full suite of our devices, networks, applications and platform while moving away from the sale of individual components - especially hardware only. Because of this strategic change, our hardware revenue declined significantly in 2016 and we expect hardware revenue to remain relatively modest as compared to historical levels thereafter. Our new sales strategy may not be effective.\nAs a holding company, our primary material assets are our ownership interests in our subsidiaries and in certain intellectual property rights. Consequently, our operating results derive from our subsidiaries and we depend on accumulated cash flows, distributions, and other inter-affiliate transfers from our subsidiaries. In view of our limited and inconsistent history of generating net income, unproven new sales strategy, level of operating costs, and all other risk factors discussed in this annual report, we may not be profitable in the future.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe sell our products in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do. Existing or new products and services that provide alternatives to our products and services could materially impact our ability to compete in these markets. As the markets for our products and services continue to develop, additional companies, including companies with significant market presence in the IoT industry, could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a further result of such competition, our new solutions and sales strategy could fail to gain market acceptance. We have recently introduced several managed services including but not limited to: iManage, a supply chain and logistics optimization solution, iTank, a bulk tank liquid monitoring and distribution optimization solution, and mySHIELD, a mobile personal emergency people tracking solution for lone workers. If these solutions and services, or any of our other existing solutions and services, do not perform as expected, or if our sales fall short of expectations, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe operate in new and rapidly evolving markets where rapid technological change can quickly make hardware solutions and services, including those that we offer, obsolete.\nThe markets in which we operate are subject to rapid advances in technology, continuously evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements, and ever-shifting customer requirements. The IoT industry, in particular, is currently undergoing profound and rapid technological change. For example, many of the current subscribers we host connect to cellular networks using 2G-based devices. Several GSM-based wireless carriers have announced their intention to discontinue their 2G networks and fully deploy 3G/4G/LTE networks between 2016 and 2020. CDMA-based carriers have announced their 2G sunset for as early as 2018. While we have begun to market, sell, and support 3G/4G/LTE-based devices and service, we may not be successful in transitioning all of our 2G-based subscribers to 3G/4G/LTE and have lost, and may continue to lose customers as a result. In addition to the carriers\u2019 migrations away from 2G technology and our need to respond to that change, the introduction of unanticipated new technologies by carriers, or the development of unanticipated new end applications by our customers, could render our current solutions obsolete. In that regard, we must discern current trends and anticipate an uncertain future. We must engage in product development efforts in advance of events that we cannot be sure will happen and time our production cycles and marketing activities accordingly. If our projections are incorrect, or if our product development efforts are not properly directed and timed, or if the demands of the marketplace shift in directions that we failed to anticipate, we may lose market share and revenues as a result. To remain competitive, we continue to support engineering and development efforts intended to bring new hardware solutions and services to the markets that we serve. However, those efforts are capital intensive. If we are unable to adequately fund our engineering and development efforts, we may not be successful in keeping our product line current and in sync with advances in technology and evolving customer requirements. Even with adequate funding, our development efforts may not yield any appreciable short-term results and may never result in hardware solutions and services that produce revenues over and above our cumulative development costs or that gain traction in the marketplace, causing us to either lose market share or fail to increase and forego increased sales and revenues as a result.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have significant intangible assets, including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. The most significant intangible assets, other than goodwill, are customer relationships, patents and core technology, completed technology and trademarks. Customer relationships are amortized on a staight line basis, which approximates the pattern over which the economic benefits are being utilized. Other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We assess the potential impairment of intangible assets on an annual basis as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded charges of $12.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nFactors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include the following:\n\u00b7 significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or cash flows;\n\u00b7 significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n\u00b7 significant negative industry or economic trends;\n\u00b7 significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period;\n\u00b7 a decline in our market capitalization below net book value; and\n\u00b7 changes in our organization or management reporting structure that could result in additional reporting units, which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit.\nFuture adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in additional material impairment charges that would negatively impact our results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not be effective.\nDuring the process of completing the audit of our financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2015, management became aware of the existence of material weaknesses in the design and operation of the internal control over financial reporting related to the evaluation process for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and capitalization of internally developed software that could adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data consistent with our assertions in the financial statements. These material weaknesses were remediated as of December 31, 2016. We may also identify additional material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in the future. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing required new or improved controls, our business and results of operations could be harmed, the results of operations we report could be subject to adjustments, we could incur further remediation costs, we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or the effectiveness of our internal controls, or fail to meet our reporting obligations under SEC regulations on a timely basis and there could be a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIf our efforts, or those of third party service providers, to maintain the privacy and security of our customer, confidential, or sensitive information are not successful at preventing a significant data breach or cyber-attack, we could incur substantial additional costs, become subject to litigation, enforcement actions or regulatory investigation, and suffer reputational damage.\nOur business, like that of many others, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of personal information and payment card information of our customers, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property (confidential information). In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third party service providers when it is necessary to pursue business objectives.\nThe methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. Cyber-attacks, such as denial of service, advanced persistent threats, other malicious attacks, unauthorized access or distribution of confidential information by third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third party suppliers, or other breaches of security could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, and protect the privacy and confidentiality of our sensitive information. Such attacks against companies are occurring with greater frequency and may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where U.S. law enforcement is or has been unable to effectively address such attacks.\nAlthough we regularly review our processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data and to prevent data loss, the ever-evolving threat landscape requires us to continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes. We cannot assure you that the security measures and preventive actions we take will be adequate to repel a significant attack, prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third party supplier environments. We may incur significant costs, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or may suffer damage to our reputation that negatively impacts customer confidence as a consequence of such attacks. Although we and our third party service providers have been subjected to unsuccessful cyber-attacks in the past that have not caused significant harm to our company future cyber-attacks may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could diminish our ability to provide service and hardware to our customers and our revenues may be impacted by weather patterns and climate change.\nEvents such as severe storms, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, solar flares, industrial accidents, and terrorist attacks including, without limitation, the actions of computer hackers, could damage or destroy both our primary and redundant facilities as well as the facilities and operations of third party cellular and satellite carriers and hardware suppliers we are reliant on, which could result in a significant disruption of our operations. Further, in the event of an emergency, the telecommunications networks that we rely upon may become capacity constrained or preempted by governmental authorities. We may also be unable, due to loss of personnel or the inability of personnel to access our facilities, to provide some services to our customers or maintain all of our operations for a period of time. With respect to our satellite-based mobile asset tracking solution in particular, sales may be influenced by weather patterns and climate change. For example, if government agencies and emergency responders anticipate relatively \u201cmild\u201d weather over one or more storm seasons on account of cyclical weather patterns or long-term climate change, they may buy fewer of our mobile asset tracking units for deployment in support of disaster response operations.\nWe are dependent on third party telecommunications service providers and other suppliers, including domestic and international cellular and satellite carriers and hardware manufacturers, the loss of any one of which could adversely impact our ability to supply or service our customers.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to operate, manage, and maintain a reliable and cost effective network, as well as our ability to keep pace with changes in technology. As described above, several wireless carriers have announced their intention to discontinue their 2G networks and fully deploy 3G, 4G and LTE networks. We, through select network service providers, intend to continue supporting 2G through at least 2020. The loss or disruption of key telecommunications infrastructure and key wireless and satellite-based network services supplied to us by carriers in the U.S., Canada, and other locations would unfavorably impact our ability to adequately service our customers. If we experience technical or logistical impediments to our ability to transfer traffic to third party facilities, or if our third party carriers experience technical or logistical difficulties of their own, such as disruptions to their supply chains caused by weather events, natural disasters, or terrorism, and are unable to carry our network traffic, we may not achieve our revenue goals or otherwise be successful in growing our business. We may not be able to continue providing service to 2G customers and may not be able to successfully transition 2G customers to other services. Given our dependence on cellular and satellite telecommunications service providers, risks specific or unique to their technologies should also be viewed as having the potential to impair our ability to provide services. For example, the loss or malfunction of a cell tower, a satellite, or a satellite ground station, could impair our ability to provide services.\nWe outsource our hardware manufacture to independent companies and do not have internal manufacturing capabilities to meet the demands of our customers. Any delay, interruption, or termination of our hardware manufacture could harm our ability to provide our solutions to our customers and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Our hardware manufacture requires specialized know-how and capabilities possessed by a limited number of enterprises. Consequently, we are reliant on just a few manufacturers. If a key supplier experiences production problems, financial difficulties, or has difficulties with its supply chain as a result of severe weather, a natural disaster, terrorism, or other unforeseen event, we may not be able to obtain enough units to meet demand, which could result in failure to meet our contractual commitments to our customers, further causing us to lose sales and generate less revenue.\nOur operations and systems capabilities are dependent on the use of cloud services and disruptions in access to cloud services could cause both revenue impacts and degradation of our levels of customer service.\nWe rely heavily on both a private cloud service that we have developed and maintain as well as various public cloud services provided by third parties. In all cases, while we and third parties maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software in these redundant sites and we don\u2019t expect to experience downtime during which we or our customers will lack access to the cloud services, it is possible that access to the software capabilities could become impaired if the cloud service goes down and becomes inaccessible. In that event, our customer service would be impaired and this could affect our reputation as well as potentially our revenue generating capability. The extent to which cloud service accessibility could be impaired would depend upon specific facts related to the cause of the downtime which is prospectively indeterminate. However, in the event of a prolonged period of inaccessibility to our cloud services, an unfavorable material impact on our revenues and our financial results from operations may occur.\nWe face substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\nWe record a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrue necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. We also review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If we determine that impairment has occurred, we record a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Although we believe the provisions related to inventory, other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that we will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which we compete. Such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are contractually obligated to provide certain of our manufacturers with forecasts of our demand for components of our hardware solutions. Specific terms and conditions vary by contract, however, if our forecasts do not result in the production of a quantity of units sufficient to meet demand we may be subject to contractual penalties under certain of our contracts with our customers. By contrast, overproduction of units based on forecasts that overestimate demand could result in an accumulation of excess inventory that, under some of our contracts with our customers, would have to be managed at our expense thus adversely impacting our margins.\nExcess inventory that becomes obsolete or that we are otherwise unable to sell would also be subject to write-offs resulting in adverse effects on our margins. Because our markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk that we will forecast incorrectly and order excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Our financial condition and operating results could in the future be materially adversely affected by our ability to manage our inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.\nWe provide product warranties to our customers which could create a substantial demand on operations to process and could result in a material impact on our results.\nWe are required to provide repair or replacement services on our equipment under managed service and warranty programs we offer to our customers. While our warranty obligations are passed through to our vendors who manufacture equipment on our behalf and, in the past, these claims have had an immaterial impact on our financial results from operations, there may be events in the future where we are required to take back equipment from customers for which we may be required to absorb the cost of these returns, especially under customers\u2019 managed service arrangements. Consequently, there could be a financial cost in the future related to such returns that could cause a material impact on our financial results from operations.\nWe may experience quality problems from time to time, resulting in decreased sales and operating margins and the loss of customers.\nWhile we test our products and services, they may still have errors, defects, or bugs that we find only after commercial production has begun. In the past, we have experienced errors, defects, and bugs in connection with new solutions. Our customers may not make purchases from us, or may make fewer purchases, if they are concerned about such problems. Furthermore, correcting problems could require additional capital expenditures, result in increased design and development costs, and force us to divert resources from other efforts. Failure to remediate problems could result in lost revenue, harm our reputation, and lead to costly warranty or other legal claims against us by our customers, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. Historically, the time required for us to correct problems has caused delays in product shipments and has resulted in lower than expected revenues.\nInterruptions in service or performance problems, no matter what their ultimate cause, could undermine confidence in our services and cause us to lose customers or make it more difficult to attract new customers. In addition, because most of our customers are businesses, any significant interruption in service could result in lost profits or other losses to our customers. It may also be difficult to identify the source of the problem due to the overlay of our network with cellular, and/or satellite networks and our network\u2019s reliance on those other networks. The occurrence of hardware or software errors, regardless of whether such errors are caused by our hardware, solutions or services, or our internal facilities, may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our solutions, and any necessary revisions may result in significant and additional expenses. Although we attempt to disclaim or limit our liability in our agreements with our customers, a court may not enforce these limitations, which could expose us to substantial losses. While some portion of these claims and liability may be insured, we could face a material loss that could substantially impact or eliminate earnings and could materially impair cash flow.\nThe quality of our support and services offerings is important to our customers and if we fail to meet our service level obligations under our service level agreements or otherwise fail to offer quality support and services, we would be subject to penalties and could lose customers.\nOur customers generally depend on our service organization to resolve issues relating to the use of our solutions. A high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions. If we are unable to provide a level of support and service to meet or exceed the expectations of our customers, we could experience:\n\u00b7 loss of customers and market share;\n\u00b7 difficulty attracting or the inability to attract new customers, and\n\u00b7 increased service and support costs and a diversion of resources.\nAny of the above results would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nAdverse macroeconomic and market conditions could negatively affect our customers\u2019 current financial condition.\nWe provide enterprise solutions and solutions that are resold by our customers - primarily value-added resellers whose customers are end users of our solutions and distributors who sell to other resellers of our solutions. Many of our customers, especially value-added resellers, operate on narrow margins and are affected by overall economic conditions. Current economic conditions, while having improved recently, may deteriorate and negatively impact demand for our customers\u2019 solutions, reducing their demand for our solutions. Our customers may also face higher financing and operating costs. If current economic conditions do not continue to improve, or alternatively, worsen, we may experience reduced revenue growth or a decrease in revenues and an increase in expenses, particularly in the form of bad debts on the part of our customers. All of these and other macroeconomic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our solutions and on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur operations are also influenced by the economic strength of the housing sector, and to a lesser extent, the oil and gas, and automotive sectors. If improvements in the housing sector are not sustained, sales of our residential and commercial alarm monitoring solutions may be impaired. If overall conditions do not continue to improve, residential and commercial consumers may decide to cancel wireless monitoring services in an effort to eliminate expenses viewed as discretionary or non-critical. Recent declines in the price of oil have depressed demand for certain of our oil and gas products and solutions, and ongoing low oil prices may continue or exacerbate the decline in this market segment. Similarly, a reversal of the recent improvement in vehicle sales would negatively impact sales of our vehicle tracking solutions.\nWe experience long sales cycles for some of our solutions.\nCertain of our product offerings are subject to long sales cycles in view of the need for testing of our hardware solutions and services in combination with our customers\u2019 applications and third parties\u2019 technologies, the need for regulatory approvals and export clearances, and the need to resolve other complex operational and technical issues. For example, in the government contracting arena, longer sales cycles are reflective of the fact that government contracts can take months or longer to progress from a \u201crequest for proposal\u201d to a finalized contract document pursuant to which we are able to sell a finished product or service. Delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period. For that reason, quarter-over-quarter comparisons of our financial results may not always be meaningful.\nA portion of our future revenue, in particular the revenue deriving from our sale of mobile asset and personal tracking solutions, may be derived from contracts with the U.S. government, state governments, or government contractors. Those contracts are subject to uncertain funding.\nThe funding of government programs is uncertain and, at the federal level, is dependent on continued congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds based on an annual budgeting process. We cannot assure that current levels of congressional funding for programs supporting our offerings will continue, particularly as a result of the Budget Control Act and the mandated substantial automatic spending cuts which began in 2013 and will last for ten years, unless Congress modifies these cuts. In particular, a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of satellite-based tracking solutions through our location-based services division has been derived from sales made by us indirectly as a subcontractor to a prime government contractor that has the direct relationship with the U.S. government. In addition, these cuts could adversely affect the viability of the prime contractor of our program. If the prime contractor loses business with respect to which we serve as a subcontractor, our government business would be hurt.\nOur operating results may be negatively affected by developments affecting government programs generally, including the following:\n\u00b7 changes in government programs that are related to our hardware solutions and services;\n\u00b7 adoption of new laws or regulations relating to government contracting or changes to existing laws or regulations; changes in political or public support for programs;\n\u00b7 delays or changes in the government appropriations process; and\n\u00b7 delays in the payment of invoices by government payment offices and the prime contractors.\nThese developments and other factors could cause governmental agencies to reduce their purchases under existing contracts, to exercise their rights to terminate contracts at-will or to abstain from renewing contracts, any of which would cause our revenue to decline and could otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment contracts contain provisions that are unfavorable to us.\nGovernment contracts contain provisions, and are subject to laws and regulations, that give the government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. These provisions may allow the government to\n\u00b7 terminate existing contracts for convenience, as well as for default;\n\u00b7 reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts;\n\u00b7 cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u00b7 decline to exercise an option to renew a multi-year contract;\n\u00b7 claim rights in our hardware solutions and services;\n\u00b7 suspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency; and\n\u00b7 control or prohibit the export of our hardware solutions and services.\nIf the government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, we may not recover even those amounts, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. We may experience performance issues on some of our contracts. We may receive show cause or cure notices under contracts that, if not addressed to the government\u2019s satisfaction, could give the government the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts in the future.\nAgreements with government agencies may lead to regulatory or other legal action against us including, without limitation, claims against us under the Federal False Claims Act or other federal statutes. These claims could result in substantial fines and other penalties.\nWe must comply with a complex set of rules and regulations applicable to government contractors and their subcontractors. Failure to comply with an applicable rule or regulation could result in our suspension of doing business with the government, or with the prime government contractors, or cause us to incur substantial penalties. Our agreements with the U.S. government are subject to substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the False Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the False Claims Act\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions. Private enforcement of fraud claims against businesses on behalf of the U.S. government has increased due in large part to amendments to the False Claims Act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by private individuals, known as qui tam actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former employees. The False Claims Act statute provides for treble damages and up to $11,000 per claim on the basis of the alleged claims. Prosecutions, investigations or qui tam actions could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, various state false claim and anti-kickback laws also may apply to us. Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal and/or civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect our business.\nEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect our business and financial performance, as well as our access to financing on favorable terms or at all.\nOur business and financial performance are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs and other macro-economic factors. Difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket volatility, economic uncertainty, and weak economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance in a number of ways. Our services are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service due to an inability to pay.\nWeak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers and customers, some of which may be experiencing cash flow or liquidity problems or are unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.\nIn addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may require additional capital to fund further development, and our competitive position could decline if we are unable to obtain additional capital, or access the credit markets.\nTo address our long-term capital needs, we intend to continue to pursue strategic relationships that would provide resources for the further development of our product candidates. There can be no assurance, however, that these discussions will result in relationships or additional funding. In addition, we may seek to raise capital through the public or private sale of securities, if market conditions are favorable for doing so. If we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, stockholders will likely experience dilution, or the equity securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities, those securities would have rights (directly or indirectly), preferences, and privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nOur loan agreement contains financial and operating restrictions that may limit our access to credit. If we fail to comply with covenants in the loan agreement, we may be required to repay any potential indebtedness thereunder, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have substantial debt obligations. The loan is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets. The loan contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, which, among other things, restrict our ability, and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability, to incur debt, allow liens on assets, make investments, pay dividends or prepay certain other debt. The loan also requires that we comply with certain financial maintenance covenants, including maintaining a minimum adjusted EBITDA, maximum consolidated total net leverage, and minimum liquidity. We were not in compliance with our covenants as of December 31, 2016. We have obtained waivers of non-compliance from Crystal Financial LLC. and amended our financial covenants as of March 31, 2017.\nOur substantial level of debt and related obligations, including interest payments, covenants and restrictions, could have important consequences, including by:\n\u00b7 impairing our ability to invest in and successfully grow our business and make acquisitions;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt obligations and other general corporate requirements;\n\u00b7 hindering our ability to raise equity capital, because, in the event of a liquidation of our business, debt holders have priority over equity holders;\n\u00b7 increasing our vulnerability to general economic downturns, competition and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveraged and therefore we may be unable to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting;\n\u00b7 imposing additional restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our business, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and sell assets; and\n\u00b7 placing us at a possible disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. Our failure to comply with the covenants under the loan could result in an event of default and the acceleration of any debt then outstanding. Any declaration of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause our stock price to decline. Insufficient funds may require us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our activities.\nWe rely on highly-skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture.\nIn our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, and other personnel. If any of our key employees were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Our employment relationships are generally at-will and we have had key employees leave in the past. We cannot assure you that one or more key employees will not leave in the future. We intend to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel, including engineers and operational personnel, but may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future. Any failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain these employees could harm our business.\nWe believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees and to attract new employees. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and in attracting new key personnel, we may not be able to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we achieve our growth goals, we may be unable to manage our resulting expansion.\nTo the extent that we are successful in implementing our business strategy, we may experience periods of rapid expansion and corresponding demand for our products. In order to effectively manage growth, whether organic or through acquisitions, we will need to maintain and improve our operations, including the ability to quickly scale our products, and effectively train and manage our employees. Our expansion through acquisitions is contingent on successful management of those acquisitions, which will require proper integration of new employees, processes and procedures, and information systems, which can be both difficult and demanding from an operational, managerial, cultural, and human resources perspective. We must also expand the capacity of our sales and distribution networks in order to achieve continued growth in our existing and future markets. The failure to manage growth effectively in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to risks associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to fixed and mobile communications devices and associated services.\nLaws and regulations related to fixed and mobile communications devices and associated services and end applications are extensive, vary by jurisdiction, and are subject to change. Such changes, could include, without limitation, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of communications devices, restrictions on the ability to port devices and associated services to new carriers\u2019 networks, requirements to make devices and associated services compatible with more than one carrier\u2019s network, or restrictions on end use could, by preventing us from fully serving affected markets, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nIn particular, communication devices we sell, or which our customers wish us to support, are subject to regulation or certification by governmental agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), industry standardization bodies such as the PCS Type Certification Review Board (PTCRB), and particular carriers for use on their networks. The procedures for obtaining required regulatory approvals and certifications are extensive and time consuming. The process of obtaining regulatory approval may require us to conduct additional testing, make modifications to our hardware solutions and services, or cause a delay in product launch and shipment dates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\nWe are subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, and among us, our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed recent laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. Noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability.\nOur privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on our website. Any failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our posted privacy policies or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.\nChanges in domestic tax regulations or unanticipated foreign tax liabilities could affect our results.\nThe issuance by the Internal Revenue Service and/or state tax authorities of new tax regulations or changes to existing standards and actions by federal, state or local tax agencies and judicial authorities with respect to applying applicable tax laws and regulations could impose costs on us that we are unable to fully recover.\nWe are doing business in, and are expanding into, foreign tax jurisdictions. We believe that we have complied in all material respects with our obligations to pay taxes in these jurisdictions. If the applicable taxing authorities were to challenge successfully our current tax positions, or if there were changes in the manner in which we conduct our activities, we could become subject to material unanticipated tax liabilities. We may also become subject, prospectively or retrospectively, to additional tax liabilities following changes in tax laws. The application of existing, new or future laws could have adverse effects on our business, prospects and operating results. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.\nThe loss of intellectual property protection, both in the U.S. and internationally, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur future success and competitive position depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection, especially with regard to our core business. We cannot be sure that steps taken by us to protect our technology will prevent misappropriation of the technology. Our services are highly dependent upon our technology and the scope and limitations of our proprietary rights therein. If our assertion of proprietary rights is held to be invalid, or if another party\u2019s use of our technology were to occur to any substantial degree, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In order to protect our technology, we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, and trade secret laws, as well as certain customer licensing agreements, employee and customer confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and other similar arrangements. Loss of such protection could compromise any advantage obtained and, therefore, impact our sales, market share, and results. To the extent that our licensees develop inventions or processes independently that may be applicable to our hardware solutions and services, disputes may arise as to the ownership of the proprietary rights to this information. These inventions or processes will not necessarily become our property, but may remain the property of these licensees or their full-time employers. We could be required to make payments to the owners of these inventions or processes, in the form of either cash or equity, or a combination of both.\nFurthermore, our future or pending patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all. In addition, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned or licensed by us. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries where we may need protection.\nWe rely on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and our future results could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to secure such access in the future.\nMany of our hardware solutions and services are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future we may need to seek or renew licenses relating to such intellectual property. Although we believe that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms; there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all. Some licenses we obtain may be nonexclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to sell some of our hardware solutions and services, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to design and incorporate alternative technologies, without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur competitors have or may obtain patents that could restrict our ability to offer our solutions and services, or subject us to additional costs, which could impede our ability to offer our solutions and services and otherwise adversely affect us. We may, from time to time, also be subject to litigation over intellectual property rights or other commercial issues.\nSeveral of our competitors have obtained and can be expected to obtain patents that cover solutions and services directly or indirectly related to those offered by us. There can be no assurance that we are aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by its solutions and services. In addition, in some cases, patent applications in the United States are kept confidential until a patent is issued and, accordingly, we cannot fully evaluate the extent to which our solutions and services may infringe on future patent rights held by others.\nEven with technology that we develop independently, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by their patents and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, such as engineering and development and the sale of any of our solutions and services. Furthermore, because of technological changes in the IoT industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our solutions, services, and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing such rights.\nIn the highly competitive and technology-dependent telecommunications field in particular, litigation over intellectual property rights is a significant business risk, and some entities are pursuing a litigation strategy the goal of which is to monetize otherwise unutilized intellectual property portfolios via licensing arrangements entered into under threat of continued litigation. Regardless of merit, responding to such litigation can consume significant time and expense. In certain cases, we may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If we are found to be infringing such rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain solutions and services or a successful claim of infringement against us requires us to pay royalties to a third party, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether we can develop non-infringing technology. While in management\u2019s opinion we do not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should we fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate internationally, which subjects us to international regulation and business uncertainties that create additional risk for us.\nWe have been doing business directly, or via our distributors, primarily in the United States and North America, and are expanding, directly or via our distributors, into additional countries worldwide. Accordingly, we or our distributors are subject to additional risks, such as:\n\u00b7 an international economic downturn;\n\u00b7 export control requirements, including restrictions on the export of critical technology;\n\u00b7 restrictions imposed by local laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 restrictions imposed by local product certification requirements;\n\u00b7 currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 generally longer receivable collection periods and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 trade restrictions and changes in tariffs;\n\u00b7 difficulties in repatriating earnings;\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n\u00b7 potential insolvency of channel partners.\nWe have only limited experience in marketing and operating our services in certain international markets. Moreover, we have in some cases experienced and expect to continue to experience in some cases higher costs as a percentage of revenues in connection with establishing and providing services in international markets versus the U.S. In addition, certain international markets may be slower than the U.S. in adopting the outsourced communications solutions and so our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investments.\nFurthermore, because regulatory schemes vary by country, we may also be subject to regulations in foreign countries of which we are not presently aware. If that were to be the case, we could be subject to sanctions by a foreign government that could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate in that country. We cannot assure that any current regulatory approvals held by us are, or will remain, sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities, or that any additional necessary approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all, in all jurisdictions in which we operate or wish to operate, or that applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions will not be unduly burdensome. The failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to operate satellites internationally could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and our overall competitive position. We, our customers and companies with which we do business may be required to have authority from each country in which we or they provide services or provide our customers use of our hardware solutions and services. Because regulations in each country are different, we may not be aware if some of our customers and/or companies with which we do business do not hold the requisite licenses and approvals.\nWe purchase from vendors located outside of the United States and consequently rely upon transportation from such vendors that is outside our control.\nSeveral of the products we sell are manufactured by vendors who are located outside of the United States. Transportation time varies considerably for these products, especially in the case of transport involving ocean freight and local customs clearing processes in the country of origin. Both transportation and customs issues which may cause delays are especially relevant and complicated for products sourced from manufacturers located in Asia. As a result, we may face delays in committed deliveries that could either result in charges from our customers or, at times, cancelled orders. While we have not had any incidence of meaningful cost related to such exposure to date, there can be no assurance that there will not be a financial impact from such events in the future.\nResults of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. In recognition of these considerations, we may enter into material settlements. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially affect our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nBecause our stock is held by a relatively small number of investors and is thinly traded, it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell our shares or buy additional shares when they desire and share prices may be volatile.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ. Our stock is thinly traded and we cannot guarantee that an active trading market will develop, or that it will maintain its current market price. A large number of shares of our common stock are held by a small number of investors. An attempt to sell a large number of shares by a large holder could materially adversely affect the price of our stock. In addition, it may be difficult for a purchaser of our shares of our common stock to sell such shares without experiencing significant price volatility. Because our shares are thinly traded, in some cases attempts to sell a large number of shares may be unsuccessful at any price due to insufficient buy side demand to complete a sell side trade.\nThe exercise or conversion of outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights into common stock will dilute the percentage ownership of our other shareholders and the sale of such shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of March 30, 2017, there are outstanding stock options and stock-settled stock appreciation rights to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock and more stock options and stock appreciation rights will likely be granted in the future to our officers, directors, employees and consultants. We may issue warrants in connection with acquisitions, borrowing arrangements or other strategic or financial transactions. The exercise of outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and warrants will dilute the percentage ownership of our other shareholders. The exercise of these stock options, stock appreciation rights and warrants and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a decline in our stock price.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:\n\u00b7 our or our competitors\u2019 actual or anticipated operating and financial results; introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u00b7 entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war;\n\u00b7 our performance, including subscriber growth, and our financial and operational metric performance;\n\u00b7 market perceptions relating to our services, devices, network, applications and platform;\n\u00b7 market perceptions of the wireless communications industry and valuation models for us and the industry;\n\u00b7 the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated consolidation, or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors or market speculations regarding such activities; and\n\u00b7 disruptions of our operations or service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations; the general state of the U.S. and world economies.\nIn addition, the stock market has been volatile in the recent past and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which may continue for the foreseeable future. This volatility has had a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. These changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe structure of our company limits the voting power of our stockholders and certain factors may inhibit changes in control of our company.\nThe concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control, merger, consolidation, or tender offer that could involve a premium over the price of our common stock. Currently, our executive officers, directors and greater-than-five percent stockholders and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 49% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if they vote together, are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions and matters. The interests of these stockholders may be different than those of our unaffiliated stockholders and our unaffiliated stockholders may be dissatisfied with the outcome of votes that may be controlled by our affiliated stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation generally limit holdings by persons of our common stock to no more than 10% without prior approval by our Board. Except as otherwise permitted by the Board, no stockholder has the right to cast more than 10% of the total votes regardless of the number of shares of common stock owned. In addition, if a person acquires holdings in excess of this ownership limit, our Board may terminate all voting rights of the person during the time that the ownership limit is violated, bring a lawsuit against the person seeking divestiture of amounts in excess of the limit, or take other actions as the Board deems appropriate. Our articles of incorporation also have a procedure that gives us the right to purchase shares of common stock held in excess of the ownership limit. In addition, our articles of incorporation permit our Board to authorize the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval. Any future series of preferred stock may have voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interests of our common stockholders. In addition to inhibiting changes of control, the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation may suppress the price of our shares.", "PERMNO": 82541, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "NMRX"}
