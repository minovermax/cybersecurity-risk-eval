Risk Factors.\nOur financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global petrochemical, specialty wax and mining businesses (due to our investment in AMAK). Many of these risk factors are not within our control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and operating results or our financial condition. We discuss some of these risks in more detail below in no particular order of priority.\nDependence on a limited number of customers could adversely impact profitability\nDuring 2014 sales to two customers each exceeded 10 percent of the South Hampton\u2019s revenues. See the information regarding dependence on a limited number of customers set forth in Part I, Item I Business under the caption \u201cUnited States Specialty Petrochemical Operation\u201d. The total loss of a large volume customer could adversely affect our ability to market products on a competitive basis and generate a profit.\nClimate change and greenhouse gas restrictions\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.\nVarying economic conditions could adversely impact demand for products\nThe demand for our products and metals correlates closely with general economic growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates or periods of civil unrest, also impact the demand for our products and metals. Economic conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to us, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to us. In addition, the revenue and\nprofitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes future financial results less predictable. Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our products, customer groups and geographic markets; and therefore, will likely be different in future periods than currently. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period\u2019s net revenue. In addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures. Market trends, competitive pressures, increased raw material or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations.\nEnvironmental regulation\nOur industries are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal and state regulations. Such environmental legislation imposes, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. Legislation also requires us to operate and maintain our facilities to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Costs to comply with these regulations are significant to our business. Failure to comply with these laws or failure to obtain permits may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in operations that could be material to our results of operations. In addition, some of the finished goods our customers produce, such as expandable polystyrene (EPS), are subject to increasing scrutiny and regulation, which could lead to a reduction in demand for our products.\nSafety, business controls, environmental and cyber risk management\nOur results depend upon management\u2019s ability to minimize the inherent risks of our operations, to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error. We apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoid spills or other adverse environmental events. Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our systems and controls do not function as intended. Business risks also include the risk of cyber security breaches. If our systems for protecting against cyber security risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by having our business systems compromised, our proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our business operations disrupted.\nRegulatory and litigation\nEven in countries with well-developed legal systems where we do business, we remain exposed to changes in law that could adversely affect our results, such as increases in taxes, price controls, changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance, and government actions to cancel contracts or renegotiate items unilaterally. We may also be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other legal proceedings, especially in countries such as the United States in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur. AMAK\u2019s Al Masane mining lease is subject to the risk of termination if AMAK does not comply with its contractual obligations. Further, our investment in AMAK is subject to the risk of expropriation or nationalization. If a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or panel or may have to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or panel in that foreign jurisdiction. Because of our substantial international investment, our business is affected by changes in foreign laws and regulations (or interpretation of existing laws and regulations) affecting our industries, and foreign taxation. We will be directly affected by the adoption of rules and regulations (and the interpretations of such rules and regulations) regarding the exploration and development of mineral properties for economic, environmental and other policy reasons. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with non-U.S. governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or may significantly limit our business activities. Additionally, our ability to compete in the international market may be adversely affected by non-U.S. governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of leases, concessions and other contracts or exploration licenses to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. We are not currently aware of any specific situations of this nature, but there are always opportunities for this type of difficulty to arise in the international business environment.\nLoss of key personnel and management effectiveness\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial, technical, sales, and marketing positions. We must also keep employees focused on our strategies and goals. The failure to hire or loss of key employees could have a significant adverse impact on operations. An important\ncomponent of our competitive performance is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and minimize the production of low margin products on an on-going basis. This requires continuous management focus including technological improvements, cost control and productivity enhancements. The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition.\nRisk associated with extraordinary transactions\nAs part of our business strategy, we sometimes engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and outsourcing transactions (\u201cextraordinary transactions\u201d) and enter into agreements relating to such extraordinary transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete extraordinary transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. Integration and other risks of extraordinary transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. If we fail to identify and complete successfully extraordinary transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and profitability. Integration issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. The challenges involved in integration include:\n\u2022\nCombining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;\n\u2022\nConvincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus, preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers (which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty), and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u2022\nMinimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nPersuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired company\u2019s non-U.S. employees, integrating employees into the Company, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;\n\u2022\nCoordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;\n\u2022\nAchieving savings from supply chain integration; and\n\u2022\nManaging integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.\nWe periodically evaluate and enter into significant extraordinary transactions on an ongoing basis. We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any extraordinary transaction, and the timeframe for achieving benefits of an extraordinary transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, suppliers or other third parties. In addition, the pricing and other terms of our contracts for extraordinary transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to achieve contractual obligations could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable. Managing extraordinary transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. These extraordinary transactions also have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings. Moreover, we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with extraordinary transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with an extraordinary transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. In order to complete an acquisition, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders, or borrow, affecting our financial condition and potentially our credit ratings. Any prior or future downgrades in our credit rating associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow\nand result in more restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and extraordinary transactions could impact our effective tax rate. We also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing an extraordinary transaction and the risk that an announced extraordinary transaction may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment community\u2019s expectations in a given quarter.\nGuaranteeing performance by others including third parties and others\nFrom time to time, we may be required or determine it is advisable to guarantee performance of loan agreements by others in which we maintain a financial interest. In such instances, if the primary obligor is unable to perform its obligations, we might be forced to perform the primary obligor\u2019s obligations which could negatively impact our financial interests.\nEconomic and political instability; terrorist acts; war and other political unrest\nThe potential for future terrorist acts and other recent events, including ISIL activities in the Middle East and the on-going Iranian nuclear confrontation have caused uncertainty in the world\u2019s financial markets and have significantly increased global political, economic and social instability, including in Saudi Arabia, a country in which we have a substantial investment. It is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the United States domestically or abroad, and such acts of terrorism could be directed against our investment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Such economic and political uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars. Our future revenue, gross margin, expenses and financial condition also could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:\n\u2022\nOngoing instability or changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u2022\nLonger accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers;\n\u2022\nTrade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products;\n\u2022\nLocal labor conditions and regulations;\n\u2022\nGeographically dispersed workforce;\n\u2022\nChanges in the regulatory or legal environment;\n\u2022\nDiffering technology standards or customer requirements;\n\u2022\nImport, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for labor and raw materials or lead to penalties or restrictions;\n\u2022\nDifficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022\nFluctuations in freight costs and disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.\nBusiness disruption\nBusiness disruptions could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade\ndisasters or business interruptions, for some of which we may be self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nDependence on AMAK management\nWe rely upon AMAK\u2019s management and Board to employ various respected engineering and financial advisors to assist in the development and evaluation of the mining projects in Saudi Arabia. During 2014 AMAK utilized the services of Uhuru International Consulting Ltd. for guidance regarding plant operations and Ocean Partners for assistance regarding marketing of the copper and zinc concentrate. In March 2014 AMAK hired a very experienced Chief Executive Officer. Notwithstanding the utilization of these consultants or hiring of experienced personnel, our risk will continue to and will ultimately depend upon AMAK\u2019s ability to use consultants and experienced personnel to manage the operation in Saudi Arabia.\nInability to control AMAK activities\nAlthough we believe that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of AMAK, we do not control AMAK\u2019s activities. The extent to which we are able to influence specific operating and financial decisions depends on our ability to persuade other AMAK board members and management regarding these policies. Our ability to persuade them may be adversely affected by cultural differences, differing accounting and management practices, differing governmental laws and regulations, and the fact that the AMAK mining project is halfway around the world from our main base of operations in the United States.\nInability to recoup investment in AMAK\nWe will only recover our investment in AMAK through the receipt of dividends from AMAK or the sale of part or all of our interest in AMAK. There is a risk that we will be unable to recover our investment in AMAK if AMAK is not profitable, or if AMAK\u2019s Board of Directors chooses not to declare dividends even if AMAK is profitable. With respect to the sale of part or all of our interest in AMAK, under Saudi Arabian law, AMAK must sell a portion of its equity to the public once AMAK has been profitable for two years. While the proceeds of such a sale might allow us to recover our investment in AMAK, there is no assurance that AMAK will achieve the profitability required for such a public sale, or that the market conditions for any such public sale will be favorable enough to allow us to recover our investment.\nCancellation of the current mining lease held by AMAK\nIn the event that the Saudi Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals cancels the current lease, AMAK shareholders including us could lose their investment or be forced to sell for a loss.\nAMAK could suffer sustained operational difficulties\nOperating difficulties are many and various, ranging from unexpected geological variations that could result in significant ground or containment failure to breakdown of key capital equipment. Reliable roads, rail networks, ports, power generation and transmission, and water supplies are required to access and conduct AMAK\u2019s operations. AMAK transports all of its products first by truck and then by sea. Limitations or interruptions in transport infrastructure could impede its ability to deliver products.\nAMAK may have fewer mineral reserves than its estimates indicate\nAMAK\u2019s reserves estimations may change substantially if new information subsequently becomes available. Fluctuations in the price of commodities, variation in production costs or different recovery rates may ultimately result in AMAK\u2019s estimated reserves being revised. If such a revision were to indicate a substantial reduction in proven or probable reserves at one or more of AMAK\u2019s projects, it could negatively affect our investment in AMAK.\nExcess Products\nAs noted previously, an important component of our competitive performance is our ability to minimize the production of low margin products on an on-going basis. Although the hydrocarbon constituents comprising the petrochemical feedstock we use may vary somewhat over time, they tend to fall into relatively narrow percentage bands as compared to overall feedstock composition. By nature of the fractionation process that we utilize, if we make one product, we make\nthem all; therefore, when we receive a significant order for a particular finished product, additional products may be manufactured necessitating sales into secondary, lower margin markets. We continue to investigate options to maintain or improve margins.", "PERMNO": 14761, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "TREC"}
