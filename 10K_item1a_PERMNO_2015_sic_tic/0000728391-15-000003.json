RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should consider carefully the following risk factors that could cause our business, operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning IPALCO and IPL set forth in the Notes to audited Consolidated Financial Statements in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.\nOur electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and/or maintenance expenses, increased fuel or purchased power costs and other significant liabilities for which we may or may not have adequate insurance coverage.\nWe operate coal, oil and natural gas generating facilities, which involve certain risks that can adversely affect energy costs, output and efficiency levels. These risks include:\n\u00a7\nincreased prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts expire or as such contracts are adjusted through price re-opener provisions or automatic adjustments;\n\u00a7\nunit or facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes;\n\u00a7\ndisruptions in the availability or delivery of fuel and lack of adequate inventories;\n\u00a7\nlabor disputes;\n\u00a7\nreliability of our suppliers;\n\u00a7\ninability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements;\n\u00a7\ndisruptions in the delivery of electricity;\n\u00a7\nthe availability of qualified personnel;\n\u00a7\noperator error; and\n\u00a7\ncatastrophic events such as fires, explosions, cyber-attacks, terrorist acts, acts of war, pandemic events, or natural or man-made disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, severe winds, ice or snow storms, droughts, or other similar occurrences affecting our generating facilities.\nThe above risks could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and/or maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures, and/or increased fuel and purchased power costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. If unexpected plant outages occur frequently and/or for extended periods of time, this could result in adverse regulatory action and/or reduced wholesale revenues.\nAdditionally, as a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation industry, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, severe winds, ice or snow storms and droughts, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or certain external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.\nThe hazardous activities described above can also cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. In addition, except for IPL\u2019s large substations, transmission and distribution assets are\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nnot covered by insurance and are considered to be outside the scope of property insurance. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any such losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not always be able to recover our costs to provide electricity to our retail customers.\nWe are currently obligated to supply electric energy to retail customers in our service territory. From time to time and because of unforeseen circumstances, the demand for electric energy required to meet these obligations could exceed our available electric generating capacity. When our retail customer demand exceeds our generating capacity for units operating under MISO economic dispatch, recovery of our cost to purchase electric energy in the MISO market to meet that demand is subject to a stipulation and settlement agreement. The agreement includes a benchmark which compares hourly purchased power costs to daily natural gas prices. Purchased power costs above the benchmark must meet certain criteria in order for us to fully recover them from our retail customers, such as consideration of the capacity of units available but not selected by the MISO economic dispatch. As a result, we may not always have the ability to pass all of the purchased power costs on to our customers, and even if we are able to do so, there may be a significant delay between the time the costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered. Since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand, the market price for electric energy at the time we purchase it could be very high under these circumstances, and we may not be allowed to recover all of such costs through our FAC. Even if a supply shortage was brief, we could suffer substantial losses that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters - FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income\u201d for additional details regarding the benchmark and the process to recover fuel costs.\nSubstantially all of our electricity is generated by coal and approximately 45% of our supply of coal comes from one supplier.\nApproximately 99% of the total kWh we generated was from coal in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. Our existing coal contracts provide for all of our current projected requirements in 2015 and approximately 84% for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017. Although we have long-term coal contracts with four suppliers, pricing provisions in some of our long-term coal contracts allow for price changes under certain circumstances. Accordingly, because of our substantial dependence on coal to meet customer demand for electricity, our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by continued price volatility in the coal market, price increases pursuant to the provisions of certain of our long-term coal contracts, and the continued regulatory and political scrutiny of coal. As discussed below, regulators, politicians and non-governmental organizations have expressed concern about GHG emissions and are taking actions which, in addition to the potential physical risk associated with climate change, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, substantially all of our coal supply is currently mined in the state of Indiana, and all of our coal supply is mined by unaffiliated suppliers or third parties. Our goal is to carry a 25-50 day system supply of coal to offset unforeseen occurrences such as equipment breakdowns and transportation or mine delays. Moreover, approximately 45% of our existing coal under contract for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017 comes from a single supplier. Any significant disruption in the ability of our suppliers, particularly our most significant supplier, to mine or deliver coal, or any failure on the part of our suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations to deliver coal, particularly disruptions in the ability or failures on the part of our suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event of disruptions or failures, there can be no assurance that we would be able to purchase power or find another supplier of coal on similarly favorable terms, which could also limit our ability to recover fuel costs through the FAC proceedings.\nCommodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive position of our business.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in the price of coal, the primary fuel we use to produce electricity, and to a lesser extent, to the changes in the prices of natural gas, purchased power and emissions allowances. In addition,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nchanges in the prices of steel, copper and other raw materials can have a significant impact on our costs. Any changes in coal prices could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position with respect to our products and services. While we have approximately 84% of our current coal requirements for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017 under long-term contracts, the balance is yet to be purchased and will be purchased under a combination of long-term contracts, short-term contracts and on the spot market. Prices can be highly volatile in both the short-term market and on the spot market. Pricing provisions in some of our long-term coal contracts allow for price changes under certain circumstances. We are also dependent on purchased power, in part, to meet our seasonal planning reserve margins. Our exposure to fluctuations in the price of coal is limited because pursuant to Indiana law, we may apply to the IURC for a change in our FAC every three months to recover our estimated fuel costs, which may be above or below the levels included in our basic rates. In addition, we may generally recover the energy portion of our purchased power costs in these quarterly FAC proceedings subject to a benchmark (as discussed in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters\u201d). We must present evidence in each proceeding that we have made every reasonable effort to acquire fuel and generate or purchase power or both so as to provide electricity to our retail customers at the lowest fuel cost reasonably possible.\nRegulators, politicians and non-governmental organizations have expressed concern about GHG emissions and are taking actions which, in addition to the potential physical risks associated with climate change, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOne byproduct of burning coal and other fossil fuels is the emission of GHGs, including CO2. At the federal, state and regional levels, policies are under development or have been developed to regulate GHG emissions, including by effectively putting a cost on such emissions to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2014, IPL emitted approximately 17 million tons of CO2 from our power plants. IPL uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by \u201cThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol\u201d reporting standard on GHG emissions. Our CO2 emissions are calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors.\nAny existing or future federal, state or regional legislation or regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance. The actual impact on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market-based compliance options are available, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on our ability to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nFurthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect our business and operations. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at our electric power generation facilities and our support facilities. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity, would also be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease our revenues. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of our fossil-fuel fired electric power generation facilities. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition to the rules already in effect, regulatory initiatives regarding GHG emissions may be implemented in the future, although at this time we cannot predict if, how, or to what extent such initiatives would affect us. Generally, we believe costs to comply with any regulations implemented to reduce GHG emissions, including those already promulgated, would be deemed as part of the costs of providing electricity to our customers and as such, we would seek recovery for such costs in our rates. However, no assurance can be given as to whether the IURC will approve such requests. Finally, concerns over GHG emissions and their effect on the environment could lead to reduced demand for coal-fired power, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfinancial condition and cash flows. Please see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters\u201d for a more comprehensive discussion of environmental matters impacting us, including those relating to regulation of GHG emissions.\nWe could incur significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations and/or material fines for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, regional and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous and other materials into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining and renewing permits and other governmental authorizations from federal, state and local agencies. A violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines, other sanctions, permit revocation and/or facility shutdowns. The amount of capital expenditures required to comply with environmental laws or regulations could be impacted by the outcome of the EPA\u2019s NOV described in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters - New Source Review,\u201d in which the EPA alleges that several physical changes to IPL\u2019s generating stations were made in noncompliance with existing environmental laws. This NOV from the EPA may also result in a fine, which could be material.\nIn addition to the five oil-fired peaking units that were retired in the second quarter of 2013, the combination of existing and expected environmental regulations make it likely that we will temporarily or permanently retire or repower several other generating units by 2017, as described in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters - Unit Retirements and Replacement Generation.\u201d These units are primarily coal-fired and not equipped with the advanced environmental control technologies needed to comply with existing and expected regulations.\nFrom time to time we are subject to enforcement actions for claims of noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. IPL cannot assure that it will be successful in defending against any claim of noncompliance. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. We could also be held liable for human exposure to such hazardous substances or for other environmental damage. We cannot assure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters\u201d for a more comprehensive discussion of environmental matters impacting us.\nThe use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business could result in losses that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe sometimes use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity and financial risks. Losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, if a counterparty fails to perform, or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management\u2019s judgment or the use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or the use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nOur business is sensitive to weather and seasonal variations.\nOur business is affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. As a result of these factors, the operating revenues and associated operating expenses are not generated evenly by month during the year. We forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal weather (such as warmer winters and cooler summers) could have a material impact on our revenue, operating income and net income and cash flows. Storms that interrupt services to our customers have required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to incur significant costs to restore services.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur participation in MISO involves risks.\nWe are a member of MISO, a FERC approved regional transmission organization. MISO serves the electrical transmission needs of a 15-state area including the Midwest and maintains functional operational control over our electric transmission facilities as well as that of the other utility members of MISO. We retain control over our distribution facilities. As a result of membership in MISO and its operational control, our continued ability to import power, when necessary, and export power to the wholesale market has been, and may continue to be, impacted. We offer our generation and bid our load into this market on a day-ahead basis and settle differences in real time. Given the nature of MISO\u2019s policies regarding use of transmission facilities, and its administration of the energy and ancillary services markets, it is difficult to predict near-term operational impacts. We cannot assure MISO\u2019s reliable operation of the regional transmission system, nor the impact of its operation of the energy and ancillary services markets.\nAt the federal level, there are business risks for us associated with multiple proceedings pending before the FERC related to our membership and participation in MISO. These proceedings involve such issues as transmission rates, construction of new transmission facilities, the allocation of costs of transmission expansion due to the renewable mandates of other states, and the evolving tariff requirements for resource adequacy.\nTo the extent that we rely, at least in part, on the performance of MISO to maintain the reliability of our transmission system, it puts us at some risk for the performance of MISO. In addition, actions taken by MISO to secure the reliable operation of the entire transmission system operated by MISO could result in voltage reductions, rolling blackouts, or sustained system-wide blackouts on IPL\u2019s transmission and distribution system, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. (See also \u201cItem 1. Business - MISO Operations\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters.\u201d)\nOur ownership by AES subjects us to potential risks that are beyond our control.\nAll of IPL\u2019s common stock is owned by IPALCO, all of whose common stock is owned by AES U.S. Investments, except for 100 shares owned by CDPQ. Due to our relationship with AES, any adverse developments and announcements concerning them may affect our ability to access the capital markets and to otherwise conduct business. In particular, downgrades in AES\u2019s credit ratings could likely result in IPL or IPALCO\u2019s credit ratings being downgraded.\nIf we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates.\nAs an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, IPL is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures. Although we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the IURC will approve full recovery in a timely manner. If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on access to the capital markets. General economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all, and cause increases in our interest expense.\nFrom time to time we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. It is possible that our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all could be adversely\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\naffected by future market conditions, and we may be unable to access adequate funding to refinance our debt as it becomes due or finance capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the overall supply and demand in the credit markets, our credit ratings, credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions. It may also depend on the performance of credit counterparties and financial institutions with which we do business.\nSee Note 9, \u201cIndebtedness\u201d to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of IPALCO in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Form 10-K for information regarding indebtedness. See also \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\u201d for information related to market risks.\nThe level of our indebtedness, and the security provided for this indebtedness, could adversely affect our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had on a consolidated basis $2.0 billion of indebtedness and total common shareholder\u2019s equity of $151.3 million. IPL had $1,155.3 million of first mortgage bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2014, which are secured by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of IPL under the terms of IPL\u2019s mortgage and deed of trust. IPL also had $50 million of secured indebtedness pursuant to a receivables sale facility. This level of indebtedness and related security could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u00a7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00a7\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund other corporate purposes;\n\u00a7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00a7\nlimiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, as needed.\nWe expect to incur additional debt in the future, subject to the terms of our debt agreements and regulatory approvals for any IPL debt. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. For a further discussion of outstanding debt, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur transmission and distribution system is subject to reliability and capacity risks.\nThe ongoing reliable performance of our transmission and distribution system is subject to risks due to, among other things, weather damage, intentional or unintentional damage, fires and/or explosions, plant outages, labor disputes, operator error, or inoperability of key infrastructure internal or external to us. The failure of our transmission and distribution system to fully deliver the energy demanded by customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and if such failures occur frequently and/or for extended periods of time, could result in adverse regulatory action. In addition, the advent and quick adaptation of new products and services that require increased levels of electrical energy cannot be predicted and could result in insufficient transmission and distribution system capacity. As with all utilities, potential concern with the adequacy of transmission capacity on IPL\u2019s system or the regional systems operated by MISO could result in the MISO, the NERC, the FERC or the IURC requiring us to upgrade or expand our transmission system through additional capital expenditures or share in the costs of regional expansion.\nCatastrophic events could adversely affect our facilities, systems and operations.\nCatastrophic events such as fires, explosions, cyber-attacks, terrorist acts, acts of war, pandemic events, or natural or man-made disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, severe winds, ice or snow storms, droughts, or other similar occurrences could adversely affect our generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, operations, earnings and cash flow. Our Petersburg Plant, which is our largest source of generating capacity, is\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nlocated in the Wabash Valley seismic zone, adjacent to the New Madrid seismic zone, which are areas of significant seismic activity in the central U.S.\nCurrent and future conditions in the economy may adversely affect our customers, suppliers and counterparties, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and will continue to be affected by general economic conditions. As a result of slowing global economic growth, credit market conditions, fluctuating consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, and other challenges currently affecting the general economy, some of our customers have experienced and may continue to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing customers may reduce their electricity consumption and may not be able to fulfill their payment obligations to us in the normal, timely fashion. In addition, some existing commercial and industrial customers may discontinue their operations. Furthermore, projects which may result in potential new customers may be delayed until economic conditions improve. In particular, the projected economic growth and total employment in Indianapolis are important to the realization of our forecasts for annual energy sales.\nAt times, we may utilize forward contracts to manage the risk associated with power purchases and wholesale power sales, and could be exposed to counterparty credit risk in these contracts. Further, some of our suppliers, customers and other counterparties, and others with whom we transact business may be experiencing financial difficulties, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. For example, our counterparties on forward purchase contracts and financial institutions involved in our credit facility may become unable to fulfill their contractual obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements. If the general economic slowdown continues for significant periods or deteriorates significantly, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWholesale power marketing activities may add volatility to earnings.\nWe engage in wholesale power marketing activities that primarily involve the offering of utility-owned or contracted generation into the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. As part of these strategies, we may also execute energy contracts that are integrated with portfolio requirements around power supply and delivery. The earnings from wholesale marketing activities may vary based on fluctuating prices for electricity and the amount of electric generating capacity, beyond that needed to meet firm service requirements. In order to reduce the risk of volatility in earnings from wholesale marketing activities, we may at times enter into forward contracts to hedge such risk. If we do not accurately forecast future commodities prices or if our hedging procedures do not operate as planned we may experience losses. We did not use such hedges in 2014, 2013 or 2012.\nIn addition, the introduction of additional renewable energy into the MISO market could have the effect of reducing the demand for wholesale energy from other sources. The additional generation produced by renewable energy sources could have the impact of reducing market prices for energy and could reduce our opportunity to sell coal- fired and gas generation into the MISO market, thereby reducing our wholesale sales. Additionally, decreases in natural gas prices in the U.S. have the impact of reducing market prices for electricity, which can reduce our ability to sell excess generation on the wholesale market, as well as reduce our profit margin on wholesale sales.\nEconomic conditions relating to the asset performance and interest rates of the \u201cPension Plans could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nPension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, level of employer contributions, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of our Pension Plans\u2019 assets compared to pension obligations under the Pension Plans. We are responsible for funding any shortfall of our Pension Plans\u2019 assets compared to pension obligations under the Pension Plans, and a significant increase in our pension liabilities could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We are subject to the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which requires plans that are less than 100% funded to fully fund any funding shortfall in amortized level\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ninstallments over seven years, beginning in the year of the shortfall. In addition, we must also contribute the normal service cost earned by active participants during the plan year. Each year thereafter, if the plan\u2019s underfunding increases to more than the present value of the remaining annual installments, the excess is separately amortized over a new seven-year period.\nPlease see Note 11, \u201cPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\u201d to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of IPALCO in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nParties providing construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations, which could harm our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur construction program calls for extensive expenditures for capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades, improvements to generation, transmission and distribution facilities, as well as other initiatives. As a result, we have engaged, and will continue to engage, numerous contractors and have entered into a number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain the required construction related services. This exposes us to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could fail to perform, or take longer than anticipated to complete projects. In addition, some contracts provide for us to assume the risk of price escalation and availability of certain metals and key components. This could force us to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and cause construction delays. It could also subject us to enforcement action by regulatory authorities to the extent that such a contractor failure resulted in a failure by IPL to comply with requirements or expectations, particularly with regard to the cost of the project. Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions. This could adversely affect our financial results, and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe may be subject to material litigation, regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, audits, settlements, investigations and claims from time to time. There can be no assurance that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see Note 3, \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d and Note 12, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of IPALCO in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d included in this Form 10-K for a summary of significant regulatory matters and legal proceedings involving us.\nThe electricity business is highly regulated and any changes in regulations, adverse regulatory actions, deregulation, or new legislation could reduce revenues and/or increase costs.\nAs an electric utility, we are subject to extensive regulation at both the federal and state level. At the federal level, we are regulated by the FERC and the NERC and, at the state level, we are regulated by the IURC. The regulatory power of the IURC over IPL is both comprehensive and typical of the traditional form of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. We face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action. Regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in Indiana. We are subject to regulation by the IURC as to our services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of securities (other than evidences of indebtedness payable less than twelve months after the date of issue), the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters.\nOur tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges and various adjustment mechanisms which are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings. Pursuant to statute, the IURC is to conduct a periodic review of the basic rates and charges of all Indiana utilities at least once every four years, but the IURC has the authority to review the rates of any Indiana utility at any time. Proceedings to review our basic rates and charges involve IPL, the IURC, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and other interested stakeholders. Our basic rates and charges were last adjusted in 1996; however, IPL filed a petition with the IURC on December 29, 2014, for authority to increase its basic rates and charges by approximately $67.8 million annually, or\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n5.6%. An order on this proceeding will likely be issued by the IURC in the fourth quarter of 2015 with any rate change expected to become effective by early 2016. No assurances can be given as to the outcome of this proceeding. In addition, we must seek approval from the IURC through such public proceedings of our tracking mechanism factors to reflect changes in our fuel costs to generate electricity or purchased power costs and for the timely recovery of costs incurred during construction and operation of CCT facilities constructed to comply with environmental laws and regulations, recovery of costs associated with providing mandatory DSM programs, and for certain other costs. There can be no assurance that we will be granted approval of tracking mechanism factors that we request from the IURC. The failure of the IURC to approve any requested relief, or any other adverse rate determination by the IURC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn recent years, federal and state regulation of electric utilities has changed dramatically, and the pace of regulatory change is likely to pick up in coming years. As a result of the EPAct and subsequent legislation affecting the electric utility industry, we have been required to comply with new rules and regulations in areas including mandatory reliability standards, cyber security, transmission expansion and energy efficiency. These rules and regulations are, for the most part, still in their infancy. Regulatory agencies at the state and federal level are in the process of implementation. We are currently unable to predict the long-term impact, if any, to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIndependent of the IURC\u2019s ability to review basic rates and charges, Indiana law requires electric utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC to meet operating expense and income test requirements as a condition for approval of requested changes in the FAC. Additionally, customer refunds may result if a utility\u2019s rolling twelve-month operating income, determined at quarterly measurement dates, exceeds a utility\u2019s authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income and there are not sufficient applicable cumulative net operating income deficiencies against which the excess rolling twelve-month jurisdictional net operating income can be offset.\nFuture events, including the advent of retail competition within IPL\u2019s service territory, could result in the deregulation of part of IPL\u2019s existing regulated business. Upon deregulation, adjustments to IPL\u2019s accounting records may be required to eliminate the historical impact of regulatory accounting. Such adjustments, as required by FASB ASC 980 \u201cRegulated Operations,\u201d could eliminate the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities. Required adjustments could include the expensing of any unamortized net regulatory assets, the elimination of certain tax liabilities, and a write down of any impaired utility plant balances. We expect IPL to meet the criteria for the application of ASC 980 for the foreseeable future.\nWe are subject to employee workforce factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to employee workforce factors, including, among other things, loss or retirement of key personnel (approximately 59% of our employees are over the age of 50 and have an average of 25 years of experience), availability of qualified personnel, and collective bargaining agreements with employees who are members of a union. Approximately 66% of our employees are represented by the IBEW in two bargaining units: a physical unit and a clerical-technical unit. We may not be able to successfully train new personnel as current workers with significant knowledge and expertise retire. We also may be unable to staff our business with qualified personnel in the event of significant absenteeism related to a pandemic illness. Work stoppages or other workforce issues could affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nInformation technology security vulnerabilities could have a material adverse impact on our reputation and/or our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe require access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business. If a significant breach of our information technology security system occurred, our reputation could be adversely affected, customer confidence could be diminished, customer information could be used for identity theft purposes, or we could be subject to costs associated with the breach. In the event of any such breach, we could be subject to fines and legal claims, which could affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIPALCO is a holding company and is dependent on dividends from IPL to meet its debt service obligations.\nIPALCO is a holding company with no material assets other than the common stock of its subsidiaries, and accordingly all cash is generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries, principally IPL. IPL\u2019s mortgage and deed of trust, its amended articles of incorporation and its $250 million revolving credit facilities agreement contain restrictions on IPL\u2019s ability to issue certain securities or pay cash dividends to IPALCO. For example, there are restrictions that require maintenance of a leverage ratio which could limit the ability of IPL to pay dividends. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of these restrictions. See Note 9, \u201cIndebtedness\u201d to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of IPALCO in \u201cItem 8.
