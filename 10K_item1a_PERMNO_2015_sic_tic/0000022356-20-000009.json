If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price for your securities could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Commerce Bancshares, Inc.\nDifficult market conditions may affect the Company\u2019s industry.\nThe concentration of the Company\u2019s banking business in the United States particularly exposes it to downturns in the U.S. economy. While current economic conditions are favorable, there remain risks in that environment.\nIn particular, the Company may face the following risks in connection with market conditions:\n\u2022\nIn 2019, the United States economy entered the longest expansion in its history. Despite some weakness in consumer confidence in late 2019, the expansion keeps progressing, seemingly boosted by tax reform in 2018 and a lower interest rate environment. Unemployment levels remain low and the stock market has performed well in 2019 and early 2020.\n\u2022\nThe U.S. economy is affected by global events and conditions, including U.S. trade disputes and renewed trade agreements with various countries. Although the Company does not directly hold foreign debt or have significant activities with foreign customers, the global economy, the strength of the U.S. dollar, international trade conditions, and oil prices may ultimately affect interest rates, business import/export activity, capital expenditures by businesses, and investor confidence. Unfavorable changes in these factors may result in declines in consumer credit usage, adverse changes in payment patterns, reduced loan demand, and higher loan delinquencies and default rates. These could impact the Company\u2019s future loan losses and provision for loan losses, as a significant part of the Company\u2019s business includes consumer and credit card lending.\n\u2022\nIn addition to the results above, a slowdown in economic activity may cause declines in financial services activity, including declines in bank card, corporate cash management and other fee businesses, as well as the fees earned by the Company on such transactions.\n\u2022\nThe process used to estimate losses inherent in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including consideration of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. If an instance occurs that renders these predictions no longer capable of accurate estimation, this may in turn impact the reliability of the process.\n\u2022\nCompetition in the industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions, thereby reducing market prices for various products and services which could in turn reduce the Company\u2019s revenues.\nThe performance of the Company is dependent on the economic conditions of the markets in which the Company operates.\nThe Company\u2019s success is heavily influenced by the general economic conditions of the specific markets in which it operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides financial services primarily throughout the states of Missouri, Kansas, central Illinois, Oklahoma, and Colorado. It also has a growing presence in additional states through its commercial banking offices in: Texas, Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. As the Company does not have a significant banking presence in other parts of the country, a prolonged economic downturn in these markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nThe Company operates in the financial services industry and has numerous competitors including other banks and insurance companies, securities dealers, brokers, trust and investment companies, mortgage bankers, and financial technology companies. Consolidation among financial service providers and new changes in technology, product offerings and regulation continue to challenge the Company's marketplace position. As consolidation occurs, larger regional and national banks may enter the Company's markets and add to existing competition. Large, national financial institutions have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources. These new competitors may lower fees to grow market share, which could result in a loss of customers and lower fee revenue for the Company. They may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than the Company, and may have higher loan limits, both of which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively. The Company must continue to make investments in its products and delivery systems to stay competitive with the industry, or its financial performance may suffer.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institution counterparties. Financial services institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with these institutions include overnight and term borrowings, interest rate swap agreements, securities purchased and sold, short-term investments, and other such transactions. Because of this exposure, defaults by, or rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and defaults by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client, while other transactions expose the Company to liquidity risks should funding sources quickly disappear. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.\nAs part of the financial services industry, the Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system, not shareholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nSignificant changes in federal monetary policy could materially affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and interest rates earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits. Credit conditions are influenced by its open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the member bank discount rate, and bank reserve requirements. Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies are beyond the Company\u2019s control and difficult to predict, and such changes may result in lower interest margins and a lack of demand for credit products.\nThe Company is subject to both interest rate and liquidity risk.\nWith oversight from its Asset-Liability Management Committee, the Company devotes substantial resources to monitoring its liquidity and interest rate risk on a monthly basis. The Company's net interest income is the largest source of overall revenue to\nthe Company, representing 61% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The interest rate environment in which the Company operates fluctuates in response to general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence loan originations, deposit generation, demand for investments and revenues, and costs for earning assets and liabilities, and could significantly impact the Company\u2019s net interest income.\nAfter raising rates four times in 2018, the Federal Reserve Board lowered the benchmark interest rate three times during 2019 for a total of 75 basis points. Future economic conditions or other factors could shift monetary policy resulting in increases or additional decreases in the benchmark rate. Furthermore, changes in interest rates could result in unanticipated changes to customer deposit balances and funding costs and affect the Company\u2019s source of funds for future loan growth.\nThe impact of the phase-out of LIBOR is uncertain.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that LIBOR would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021 as panel banks would no longer be required to submit estimates that are used to construct LIBOR. U.S. regulatory authorities have voiced similar support for phasing out LIBOR. The Company has a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The impact of alternatives to LIBOR on the valuations, pricing and operation of the Company's financial instruments is not yet known. The Company is coordinating with industry groups to identify an appropriate replacement rate for contracts expiring after 2021, as well as preparing for this transition as it relates to new and existing contracts and customers. The Company has established a LIBOR Transition Program, which is lead by the LIBOR Transition Steering Committee (Committee) whose purpose is to guide the overall transition process for the Company. The Committee is an internal, cross-functional team with representatives from all relevant business lines, support functions and legal counsel. An initial LIBOR impact and risk assessment has been performed, which identified the associated risks across products, systems, models, and processes. The Committee is assessing the results of the assessment and developing and prioritizing actions. Additionally, LIBOR fallback language has been included in key loan provisions of new and renewed loans in preparation for transition from LIBOR to the new benchmark rate when such transition occurs.\nThe Company may be adversely affected if the interest rates currently tied to LIBOR on the Company's loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments are not able to be transitioned to an alternative rate. Furthermore, the Company may be faced with disputes or litigation with counterparties regarding interpretation and enforcement of fallback language in new and renewed loans as the transition to a new benchmark rate continues to evolve.\nThe Company\u2019s asset valuation may include methodologies, models, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company uses estimates, assumptions, and judgments when certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in greater financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices and/or other observable inputs provided by independent third-party sources, when available. When such third-party information is not available, fair value is estimated primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the Company\u2019s future financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if models used to calculate fair value of financial instruments are inadequate or inaccurate due to flaws in their design or execution, upon sale, the Company may not realize the cash flows of a financial instrument as modeled and could incur material, unexpected losses.\nDuring periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, certain asset valuations may require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio values may be adversely impacted by deterioration in the credit quality of underlying collateral within the various categories of investment securities it owns.\nThe Company generally invests in securities issued by municipal entities, government-backed agencies or privately issued securities, with collateral that are highly rated and evaluated at the time of purchase, however, these securities are subject to changes\nin market value due to changing interest rates and implied credit spreads. While the Company maintains prudent risk management practices over bonds issued by municipalities, credit deterioration in these bonds could occur and result in losses. Certain mortgage and asset-backed securities (which are collateralized by residential mortgages, credit cards, automobiles, mobile homes or other assets) may decline in value due to actual or expected deterioration in the underlying collateral. Under accounting rules, when the impairment is due to declining expected cash flows, some portion of the impairment, depending on the Company\u2019s intent to sell and the likelihood of being required to sell before recovery, must be recognized in current earnings. This could result in significant losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses may be insufficient or future credit losses could increase.\nThe allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019 reflects management's best estimate of probable loan losses that have been incurred within the existing loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. See the section captioned \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report for further discussion related to the Company\u2019s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses at December 31, 2019.\nIn 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard \"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" (ASU 2016-13), which became effective January 1, 2020 and was adopted by the Company at that time. This new standard significantly altered the way the allowance for credit losses is determined. The new standard utilizes a life of loan loss concept and required significant operational changes, especially in data collection and analysis. The level of the allowance will be based on management\u2019s methodology that utilizes historical net charge-off rates, and adjusts for the impacts in the reasonable and supportable forecast and other qualitative factors. Key assumptions include the application of historical loss rates, prepayment speeds, forecast results of a reasonable and supportable period, the period to revert to historical loss rates, and qualitative factors. Although credit losses have been stable during the past several years, an unforeseen deterioration of financial market conditions could result in larger credit losses, which may negatively affect the Company's results of operations and could significantly increase its allowance for credit losses. The Company\u2019s allowance level is subject to review by regulatory agencies, and that review could also result in adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, the Company's provision for credit losses may be more volatile in the future under the new standard, due to macroeconomic variables that influence the Company's loss estimates, and the volatility in credit losses may be material to the Company's earnings.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Company to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and new products or services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business, or new product or service, could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nA successful cyber attack or other computer system breach could significantly harm the Company, its reputation and its customers.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business, and as part of its business, the Company maintains significant amounts of data about its customers and the products they use. Information security risks continue to increase due to new technologies, the increasing use of the Internet and telecommunication technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, and others. The Company makes significant investments in various technology to identify and prevent intrusions into its information system. The Company also has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, offers ongoing training to employees, hosts tabletop exercises to test response readiness, and performs regular audits using both internal and outside resources. However, there can be no assurances that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. In addition to unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks or other operational disruptions could overwhelm Company websites and prevent the Company from adequately serving customers. Should any of the Company's systems become compromised or customer information be obtained by unauthorized parties, the reputation of the Company could be damaged, relationships with existing customers may be impaired, and the Company could be subject to lawsuits, all of which could result in lost business and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on certain external vendors.\nThe Company relies on third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations. For example, the Company outsources a portion of its information systems, communication, data management, and transaction processing to third parties. Accordingly, the Company is exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, or strategic focus. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, which could have a materially adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations. These third parties are also sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If the vendors encounter any of these issues, the Company could be exposed to disruption of service, damage to reputation and litigation. Because the Company is an issuer of both debit and credit cards, it is periodically exposed to losses related to security breaches which occur at retailers that are unaffiliated with the Company (e.g., customer card data being compromised at retail stores). These losses include, but are not limited to, costs and expenses for card reissuance as well as losses resulting from fraudulent card transactions.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including the entrance of financial technology companies offering new financial service products. The Company regularly upgrades or replaces technological systems to increase efficiency, enhance product and service capabilities, eliminate risks of end-of-lifecycle products, reduce costs, and better serve our customers. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may encounter significant problems and may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services and may not be successful in marketing the new products and services to its customers. These problems might include significant time delays, cost overruns, loss of key people, and technological system failures. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry or failure to successfully complete the replacement of technological systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company plans to convert its core customer and deposit systems during 2020 and may encounter significant adverse developments.\nThe Company will replace its core customer and deposit systems and other ancillary systems (collectively referred to as core system). The core system is used to track customer relationships and deposit accounts. The core system is integrated with channel applications that are used to service customer requests by bank personnel or directly by customers (such as online banking and mobile applications). The new core system will provide a new platform based on current technology and will enable the Company to integrate other systems more efficiently, and is a significant improvement compared to our current core system. However, changing the core system will subject the Company to operational risks during and after the conversion, including disruptions to our technology systems, which may adversely impact our customers. We have plans, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the risks of a failure during or after the conversion of our core system. However, there can be no assurance that any such adverse development will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be timely and adequately remediated. The ultimate impact of any adverse development could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possibly financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCommerce Bancshares, Inc. relies on dividends from its subsidiary bank for most of its revenue.\nCommerce Bancshares, Inc. is a separate and distinct legal entity from its banking and other subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiary bank. These dividends, which are limited by various federal and state regulations, are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on its preferred and common stock and to meet its other cash needs. In the event the subsidiary bank is unable to pay dividends, the Company may not be able to pay dividends or other obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company must attract and retain skilled employees.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense, and the Company spends considerable time and resources attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified people for its various business lines and support units. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of the Company\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of the Company\u2019s market, and years of industry experience, as well as the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.", "PERMNO": 25129, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBSH"}
