{"cik": "1361658", "company": "Travel & Leisure Co.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material risks may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe may not be able to achieve the objectives of our acquisition of the Travel + Leisure brand or the future prospects and plans for the Company.\nOn January 5, 2021, we acquired the Travel + Leisure brand and all related assets from Meredith Corporation. On February 17, 2021, Wyndham Destinations, Inc. changed its name to Travel + Leisure Co., and the new Travel + Leisure Co. stock began trading under the ticker symbol NYSE: TNL. See Note 32-Subsequent Events to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning this acquisition.\nThe expected results of the transaction and the future prospects for, and plans of, our company are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including (without limitation) unanticipated costs and/or delays; unfavorable reaction by customers, partners, employees, or suppliers; future revenues being lower than expected; failure or inability to implement growth or expansion strategies in a timely manner or at all; local and global political and economic conditions.\nPromotion activities associated with our new business may not yield increased revenue in the time expected or at all, and, even if revenue does increase, it may not be sufficient to offset the expenses we incur in building our brands. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our new business and brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract or retain customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return with respect to the acquisition and our rebranding efforts, which would adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, a portion of the value associated with the Travel + Leisure brand is derived from the long-standing commitment to high-quality, independent travel journalism by Travel + Leisure magazine and associated media properties, which will continue to be operated by Meredith outside our control. If the quality or reach of such media properties deteriorates in the future, it could negatively impact the perception of the Travel + Leisure brand and adversely impact our business.\nThe timeshare industry is highly competitive and we are subject to risks related to competition that may adversely affect our performance.\nWe will be adversely impacted if we cannot compete effectively in the highly competitive timeshare industry. Our continued success depends upon our ability to compete effectively in markets that contain numerous competitors, some of which may have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Competition in the timeshare industry is based on brand name recognition and reputation as well as location, quality of accommodations, price, service levels and amenities, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, reservation systems, flexibility of members to exchange into other timeshare properties or other travel awards, property size and availability, customer satisfaction, consumer confidence, consumer discretionary spending, and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. New resorts may be constructed and these additions to supply may create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand. Competition may reduce fee structures, potentially causing us to lower our fees or prices, which may adversely impact our profits. New competition or existing competition that uses a business model that is different from our business model may require us to change our model so that we can remain competitive.\nAcquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions may not prove successful and could result in operating difficulties.\nWe regularly consider a wide array of acquisitions and other potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses and real property, joint ventures, business combinations, strategic investments and dispositions. Any of these transactions could be material to our business. We often compete for these opportunities with third parties, which may cause us to lose potential opportunities or to pay more than we may otherwise have paid absent such competition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate strategic transactions and opportunities on favorable terms or that any such\nstrategic transactions or opportunities, if consummated, will be successful. Assimilating any strategic transactions may also create unforeseen operating difficulties and costs.\nOn May 9, 2018, we completed the sale of our European vacation rentals business and, on October 22, 2019, we completed the sale of our North American vacation rentals business. Dispositions of businesses, such as our European and North American vacation rentals transactions, pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including costs or disputes with buyers. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement, as we may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against, credit support obligations, contingent liabilities related to a divested business, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, or other matters. Under these types of arrangements, performance by the divested business or other conditions outside of our control could affect our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 29-Transactions with Former Parent and Former Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our obligations related to the European vacation rentals business and the North American vacation rentals business and Note 7-Held-for-Sale Business to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the North American vacation rentals transaction, both of which are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn August 7, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Alliance Reservations Network, a company that provides private-label travel booking technology solutions, and on January 5, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Travel + Leisure brand of Meredith, as described above in this Item 1A under \u201cWe may not be able to achieve the objectives of our acquisition of the Travel + Leisure brand or the future prospects and plans for the Company\u201d. Acquisitions of businesses, such as the ARN transaction, could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and/or the assumption of contingent liabilities. See Note 32-Subsequent Events and Note 5-Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements, both of which are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of the Travel + Leisure brand from Meredith, and the consideration paid, including the amount of shares of our common stock issued, in connection with the ARN transaction.\nAcquisitions may also be structured in such a way that we will be assuming unknown or undisclosed liabilities or obligations or we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following the acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, unexpected penalties or enforcement actions, and other liabilities. Moreover, we may be unable to efficiently integrate acquisitions, management attention and other resources may be diverted away from other potentially more profitable areas of our business and in some cases these acquisitions may turn out to be less compatible with our growth and operational strategy than originally anticipated. The success of our acquisitions is also subject to other risks, including, among others:\n\u2022failure to realize expected technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions;\n\u2022unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions related to the acquisitions, including those due to regulations;\n\u2022adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers, partners, employees or suppliers;\n\u2022risks associated with entering into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience, including less visibility into demand;\n\u2022inaccurate assumptions regarding the acquired business or integration process;\n\u2022financial and operational results that may differ materially from our assumptions and forecasts;\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties that may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems;\n\u2022higher than expected investments that may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including information technology systems, accounting systems and internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022failure to retain, motivate and integrate any key management and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022higher than expected costs or other impacts resulting from unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental or other regulations in jurisdictions in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and\n\u2022issues with retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into these transactions. Failure to successfully execute these transactions and integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur revenues are highly dependent on the health of the travel industry and declines in or disruptions to the travel industry such as those caused by economic conditions, terrorism or acts of gun violence, political strife, severe weather events and other natural disasters, war, and pandemics may adversely affect us.\nDeclines in or disruptions to the travel industry may adversely impact us. Risks affecting the travel and timeshare industries include: economic slowdown and recession; economic factors such as increased costs of living and reduced discretionary income adversely impacting decisions by consumers and businesses to use and consume travel services and products; terrorist incidents and threats and associated heightened travel security measures; acts of gun violence or threats thereof; political and regional strife; natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods and volcano eruptions; war; concerns with pandemics, contagious diseases or health epidemics; environmental disasters; lengthy power outages; increased pricing, financial instability and capacity constraints of air carriers; airline job actions and strikes; and increases in gasoline and other fuel prices. Further, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of storms and floods, coastal erosion and flooding due to higher sea levels, increased temperatures at winter destinations and other factors that may adversely impact the accessibility or desirability of travel to certain locations, and any regulation related to climate change could have an adverse impact on the travel industry generally. Any such disruptions to the travel or timeshare industries may adversely affect our affiliated resorts, our RCI affiliates and other developers of vacation ownership resorts and timeshare property owner associations, thereby impacting our operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to numerous business, financial, operating and other risks common to the travel and timeshare industries, any of which could reduce our revenues and our ability to make distributions and limit opportunities for growth.\nOur business is subject to numerous business, financial, operating and other risks common to the travel and timeshare industries, including adverse changes with respect to any of the following:\n\u2022consumer travel and vacation patterns and consumer preferences;\n\u2022increased or unanticipated operating costs, including as a result of inflation, energy costs and labor costs such as minimum wage increases and unionization, workers' compensation and health-care related costs and insurance which may not be fully offset by price or fee increases in our business or otherwise;\n\u2022desirability of geographic regions where resorts in our business are located;\n\u2022the supply and demand for vacation ownership services and products and exchange services and products;\n\u2022seasonality in our businesses, which may cause fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022geographic concentrations of our operations and customers;\n\u2022the availability of acceptable financing and the cost of capital as they apply to us, our customers, our RCI affiliates and other developers of vacation ownership resorts and timeshare property owner associations;\n\u2022the quality of the services provided by affiliated resorts and properties in our exchange business or resorts in which we sell VOIs or participants in the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program, which may adversely affect our image, reputation and brand value;\n\u2022overbuilding or excess capacity in one or more segments of the timeshare industry or in one or more geographic regions;\n\u2022our ability to conduct tours of our properties and generate new owners, which has been reduced during the continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022our ability to develop and maintain positive relations and contractual arrangements with VOI owners, current and potential vacation exchange members, resorts with units that are exchanged through our exchange business and timeshare property owner associations;\n\u2022organized labor activities and associated litigation;\n\u2022the bankruptcy or insolvency of customers or other adverse economic factors impacting the financial health of customers, which has impaired and could continue to impair our ability to collect outstanding fees or other amounts due or otherwise exercise our contractual rights;\n\u2022our effectiveness in keeping pace with technological developments, including with respect to social media platforms, which could impair our competitive position;\n\u2022disruptions, including non-renewal or termination of agreements, in relationships with third parties including marketing alliances and affiliations with e-commerce channels;\n\u2022owners or other developers that have development advance notes with us, or who have received loans or other financial arrangements incentives from us, who have experienced and may continue to experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022consolidation of developers could adversely affect our exchange business;\n\u2022decrease in the supply of available exchange accommodations due to, among other reasons, a decrease in inventory included in the system or resulting from ongoing property renovations or a decrease in member deposits could adversely affect our exchange business;\n\u2022decrease in or delays or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects, such as have occurred during the continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the viability of property owners' associations that we manage and the maintenance and refurbishment of vacation ownership properties, which depend on property owners associations levying sufficient maintenance fees and the ability of members to pay such maintenance fees, particularly in times of economic downturn such as caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022increases in maintenance fees, which could cause our product to become less attractive or less competitive;\n\u2022our ability to securitize the receivables that we originate in connection with sales of VOIs;\n\u2022defaults or delinquencies on loans to purchasers of VOIs who finance the purchase price of such vacation ownerships, which increase in times of economic downturn such as during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the level of unlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale schemes, which could damage our reputation and brand value;\n\u2022the availability of and competition for desirable sites for the development of vacation ownership properties, difficulties associated with obtaining required approvals to develop vacation ownership properties, liability under state and local laws with respect to any construction defects in the vacation ownership properties we develop, and risks related to real estate project development costs and completion;\n\u2022private resale of VOIs and the sale of VOIs on the secondary market, which could adversely affect our vacation ownership resorts and exchange business;\n\u2022disputes with owners of VOIs, property owners associations, and vacation exchange affiliation partners, which may result in litigation and the loss of management contracts;\n\u2022laws, regulations and legislation internationally and domestically, and on a federal, state or local level, concerning the timeshare industry, which may make the operation of our business more onerous, more expensive or less profitable;\n\u2022our failure or inability to adequately protect and maintain our trademarks and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022market perception of the timeshare industry and negative publicity from online social media postings and related media reports, which could damage our brands.\nAny of these factors could increase our costs, reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely impact our opportunities for growth.\nThird-party Internet reservation systems and peer-to-peer online networks may adversely impact us.\nConsumers increasingly use third-party internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks to search for and book their lodging accommodations. As the percentage of internet reservations increases, travel intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions and reduced room rates from us to the detriment of our business. Additionally, such travel intermediaries may divert reservations away from our direct online channels or increase the overall cost of internet reservations for our affiliated resorts through their fees. As the use of these third-party reservation channels and peer-to-peer online networks increases, consumers may rely on these channels, adversely affecting our vacation ownership and vacation exchange brands, reservation systems, bookings and rates.\nWe are subject to risks related to our vacation ownership receivables portfolio.\nWe are subject to risks that purchasers of VOIs who finance a portion of the purchase price default or otherwise delay payments on their loans due to adverse macro or personal economic conditions, third-party organizations that encourage defaults, or otherwise, which necessitates increases in loan loss reserves and adversely affects loan portfolio performance. When such defaults or delinquencies occur during the early part of the loan amortization period, we may not have recovered the marketing, selling, administrative and other costs associated with such VOIs. Additional costs are incurred in connection with the resale of\nrepossessed VOIs, and the value we recover in a resale is not in all instances sufficient to cover the outstanding debt on the defaulted loan.\nDuring 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated a program permitting our owners to defer payment on their receivables to us in order to provide financial assistance to these owners during a period of unprecedented economic insecurity. While a majority of owners who participated in this deferral program resumed normal payments to us, not all owners have resumed normal payment schedules, and financial difficulties of owners and customers arising from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased payment defaults and delinquencies both during the continuation of, and following, the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur international operations are subject to additional risks not generally applicable to our domestic operations.\nOur international operations are subject to numerous risks, including exposure to local economic conditions; potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the U.S.; hostility from local populations; political instability; threats or acts of terrorism; the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreak of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult; the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws; restrictions and taxes on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; government policies against businesses or properties owned by non-U.S. citizens; investment restrictions or requirements; diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries; forced nationalization of assets by local, state or national governments; foreign exchange restrictions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; conflicts between local laws and U.S. laws including laws that impact our rights to protect our intellectual property; withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes. Any of these risks or any adverse outcome resulting from the financial instability or performance of foreign economies, the instability of other currencies and the related volatility on foreign exchange and interest rates, could impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nFor risks related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, see \u201cRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\u201d\nChanges in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law, or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate and future cash flows could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, including as a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, and our ability to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. This includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nWe are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to our indebtedness, hedging transactions, securitization of certain of our assets, surety bond requirements, the cost and availability of capital and the extension of credit by us.\nWe are a borrower of funds under credit facilities, credit lines, senior notes, a term loan and securitization financings. We use financial instruments to reduce or hedge our financial exposure to the effects of currency and interest rate fluctuations. We are required to post surety bonds in connection with our development and sales activities. In connection with our debt obligations, hedging transactions, securitization of certain of our assets, surety bond requirements, the cost and availability of capital and the extension of credit by us, we are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022our cash flows from operations or available lines of credit may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, which could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions;\n\u2022we may be unable to comply with the terms of the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility or other debt, including a breach of the financial ratio tests, which could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying revolver debt and under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions;\n\u2022our leverage may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022our leverage may require the dedication of a significant portion of our cash flows to the payment of principal and interest thus reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases or other operating needs;\n\u2022a minimum liquidity covenant under our amended credit agreement is impacted by 50% of the amount of aggregate dividends paid after the July 2020 effective date of the amended credit agreement, which covenant will affect the amount of dividends, if any, we declare and pay to our shareholders;\n\u2022increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financing costs and the costs of our VOI financing and associated increases in hedging costs;\n\u2022during the second quarter of 2020, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) downgraded our secured debt rating from Ba2 to Ba3 with a \u201cnegative outlook\u201d, and our secured debt is rated BB- with a \u201cnegative outlook\u201d by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services (\u201cS&P\u201d) and BB+ with a \u201cnegative outlook\u201d by Fitch Rating Agency; negative ratings and/or downgrades of our debt by rating agencies could increase our borrowing costs and prevent us from obtaining additional financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022failure or non-performance of counterparties to foreign exchange and interest rate hedging transactions could result in losses;\n\u2022an inability to securitize our vacation ownership loan receivables on terms acceptable to us because of, among other factors, the performance of the vacation ownership loan receivables, adverse conditions in the market for vacation ownership loan-backed notes and asset-backed notes in general and the risk that the actual amount of uncollectible accounts on our securitized vacation ownership loan receivables and other credit we extend is greater than expected;\n\u2022breach of portfolio performance triggers under securitization transactions which if violated may result in a disruption or loss of cash flow from such transactions;\n\u2022a reduction in commitments from surety bond providers, which may impair our vacation ownership business by requiring us to escrow cash in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states;\n\u2022prohibitive cost, or inadequate availability, of capital could restrict the development or acquisition of vacation ownership resorts by us and the financing of purchases of VOIs;\n\u2022the inability of developers of vacation ownership properties that have received mezzanine and other loans from us to pay back such loans;\n\u2022increases in interest rates, which may prevent us from passing along the full amount of such increases to purchasers of VOIs to whom we provide financing; and\n\u2022disruptions in the financial markets, including potential financial uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d and the failure of financial institutions that support our credit facilities, general economic conditions and market liquidity factors outside of our control, which may limit our access to short- and long-term financing, credit and capital.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.\nThe chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, including when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR and the other alternative LIBOR rate markets. During 2020, the LIBOR rate administrator announced its intention to extend publication of LIBOR rates for most USD LIBOR tenors through June 30, 2023. Our intention is to address LIBOR fallback language in all of our debt agreements by the end of 2021.\nCurrently, we have debt and derivative instruments in place that reference LIBOR-based rates. In the transition from the use of LIBOR to SOFR or other alternatives, the level of interest payments we incur may change. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the related interest rate payable (including transition to an alternative benchmark rate) if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than, or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form.\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation.\nWe are subject to a number of claims and legal proceedings and the risk of future litigation as described in these Risk Factors and throughout this report and as may be updated in subsequent SEC filings from time to time, including, but not limited to, with respect to Cendant and the Spin-off. See further discussion in Note 20-Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 29-Transactions with Former Parent and Former Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements, both included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome or related damages and costs of litigation and other proceedings filed or asserted by or against us. Unfavorable rulings or outcomes in litigation and other proceedings may harm our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect us.\nOur operations are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we operate. In addition, U.S. and international, federal, state and local regulators may enact new laws and regulations that may reduce our revenues, cause our expenses to increase or require us to modify our business practices substantially. If we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including, among others, those governing timeshare (including required government registrations), consumer financings and other lending, information security, data protection and privacy (including the General Data Protection Regulation \u201cGDPR\u201d), credit card and payment card security standards, marketing, sales, consumer protection and advertising, unfair and deceptive trade practices, fraud, bribery and corruption, telemarketing (including do-not-call and call-recording regulations), licensing, labor, employment, anti-discrimination, health care, health and safety, accessibility, immigration, gaming, environmental (including climate change) and remediation, intellectual property, securities, stock exchange listing, accounting, tax and regulations applicable under the Dodd-Frank Act, Office of Foreign Asset Control, Americans with Disabilities Act, the Sherman Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local equivalents in international jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or actions, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties, injunctions and potential criminal prosecution. In the past, when we have been subjected to regulatory investigations, the amount of the fines involved were not material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, we cannot predict whether any future fines that regulators might seek to impose would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and proprietary information, non-compliance with our contractual obligations or other legal obligations regarding such information or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with our business, we and our service providers collect and retain large volumes of certain types of personal and proprietary information pertaining to our guests, shareholders and employees. Such information includes, but is not limited to, large volumes of guest credit and payment card information, guest travel documents, other identification documents, account numbers and other personally identifiable information. We are subject to attack by cyber-criminals operating on a global basis attempting to gain access to such information, and the integrity and protection of that guest, shareholder and employee data is critical to us.\nWhile we maintain what we believe are reasonable security controls over personal and proprietary information, including the personal information of guests, shareholders and employees, any breach of or breakdown in our systems that results in the theft, loss, fraudulent use or other unauthorized release of personal or proprietary information or other data could nevertheless occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection, which could have a material adverse effect on our brands, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant regulatory actions and fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities. Such a breach or a breakdown could also materially increase our costs to protect such information and to protect against such risks. Our and our third-party service providers\u2019 vulnerability to attack exists in relation to known and unknown threats. As a consequence, the security measures we deploy are not perfect or impenetrable, and despite our investment in and maintenance of such controls, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent all unauthorized access attempts made on our systems or those of our third-party service providers.\nAdditionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy in the U.S. and international jurisdictions is constantly evolving. For example, in the U.S., California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA provides to California consumers certain new access, deletion and opt-out rights related to their personal information, imposes civil penalties for violations and affords, in certain cases, a private right of action for data breaches. Regulations implementing the CCPA continue to be under development. Complying with the CCPA could increase our compliance cost. Similar legislation has been proposed or adopted in other states. Aspects of the CCPA and these other state laws and regulations, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them. Moreover, foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive or burdensome than those in the United States. For example, the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) GDPR imposes significant obligations to businesses that sell products or services to E.U. customers or otherwise control or process personal data of E.U. residents. Complying with GDPR caused us to update certain business practices and systems and incur costs related to continued compliance with GDPR and other international laws and regulations. In addition, should we violate or not comply with the CCPA, GDPR or any other applicable laws or regulations, contractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, or with our own privacy and security policies, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries, it could have a material adverse effect on our brands, marketing, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities.\nOur information technology infrastructure, including but not limited to our, and our third-party service providers\u2019, information systems and legacy proprietary online reservation and management systems, has been and will likely continue to be vulnerable to system failures such as server malfunction or software or hardware failures, computer hacking, phishing attacks, user error, cyber-terrorism, loss of data, computer viruses and malware installation, and other intentional or unintentional interference, negligence, fraud, misuse and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with these systems and our personal and proprietary information. In addition, as we continue to transition from our legacy systems to new, cloud-based technologies, we may continue to face start-up issues that may negatively impact guests. The increased scope and complexity of our information technology infrastructure and systems could contribute to the potential risk of security breaches or breakdown.\nThe insurance we carry may not always pay, or be sufficient to pay or reimburse us, for our liabilities, losses or replacement costs.\nWe carry insurance for general liability, property, business interruption, cyber security, and other insurable risks with respect to our business operations. We also self-insure for certain risks up to certain monetary limits. The terms and conditions or the amounts of coverage of our insurance may not at all times be sufficient to pay or reimburse us for the amount of our liabilities, losses or replacement costs, and there may also be risks for which we do not obtain insurance in the full amount or at all concerning a potential loss or liability, due to the cost or availability of such insurance. As a result, we may incur liabilities or losses in the operation of our business that are substantial, which are not sufficiently covered by the insurance we maintain, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Following the significant casualty losses incurred by the insurance industry due to hurricanes, fires and other events, property insurance costs have been and in the future may be higher, and availability may be lower, in future periods, particularly in certain geographies.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and on uninterrupted operation of service facilities.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and on uninterrupted operation of service facilities, including those used for reservation systems, payments systems, vacation exchange systems, property management, communications, procurement, member record databases, call centers, operation of our loyalty programs and administrative systems. We also maintain physical facilities to support these systems and related services. Any natural disaster, cyberattack, disruption or other impairment in our technology capabilities and service facilities or those of our third-party service providers could result in denial or interruption of service, financial losses, customer claims, litigation or damage to our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, any failure of our ability to provide our reservation systems, as a result of failures related to us or our third-party providers, may deter prospective resort owners from entering into agreements with us, and may expose us to liability from other parties with whom we have contracted to provide reservation services. Similarly, failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.\nThe growth of our business and the execution of our business strategies depend on the services of our senior management and our associates.\nWe believe that our future growth depends, in part, on the continued services of our senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael D. Brown, and on our ability to successfully implement succession plans for\nmembers of our senior management team. The loss of any members of our senior management team, or the failure to identify successors for such positions, could adversely affect our strategic and customer relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies. In addition, insufficient numbers of talented associates could constrain our ability to maintain and expand our business. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we cannot recruit, train, develop or retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency or internal control failures.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nMany factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers and other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas, such as safety and security, responsible tourism, environmental stewardship and sustainability, supply chain management, climate change, diversity, human rights and modern slavery, philanthropy and support for local communities.\nCurrent and future international operations expose us to additional challenges and risks that may not be inherent in operating solely in the U.S. due to different social or cultural norms and practices that are not customary in the U.S., distance and language, including, but not limited to, our ability to sell products and services, enforce intellectual property rights and staff and manage operations.\nWe are responsible for certain of Cendant's contingent and other corporate liabilities.\nUnder the separation agreement and the tax sharing agreement that we executed with Cendant (now Avis Budget Group) and former Cendant units, Realogy and Travelport, Travel + Leisure and Realogy generally are responsible for 37.5% and 62.5% of certain of Cendant's contingent and other corporate liabilities and associated costs including certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of Cendant or its subsidiaries to the extent incurred on or prior to August 23, 2006. As a result of the completion of the Spin-off, Wyndham Hotels agreed to retain one-third of Cendant\u2019s contingent and other corporate liabilities and associated costs; therefore, we are responsible for 25% of these liabilities and costs subsequent to the Spin-off. These liabilities include those relating to certain of Cendant's terminated or divested businesses, the Travelport sale, certain Cendant- related litigation, actions with respect to the separation plan and payments under certain contracts that were not allocated to any specific party in connection with the separation.\nIf any party responsible for the liabilities described above were to default on its obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay an equal portion of the amounts in default. Accordingly, we could under certain circumstances be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our share of the assumed obligations related to such liabilities including associated costs.\nWe may incur impairment charges related to the fair value of our assets.\nChanges to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates may cause us to incur impairment losses and require us to write-off all or a portion of the remaining value of our goodwill or other intangibles of companies we have acquired.\nOur total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. We may be required to record a significant non-cash impairment charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets or other assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations and shareholders' equity.\nIn 2020, we recorded $56 million of asset impairment charges, primarily associated with the impact of COVID-19 on our business. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to impact the U.S. and global economy and our business, we cannot assure that these charges will be adequate in response to these unprecedented events or that additional asset impairment charges may not be required in the future related to COVID-19 concerns or events or otherwise.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly negatively affected our operations and may significantly negatively affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has led, and will likely continue to lead, to disruptions in the global and U.S. economy, in the timeshare and leisure travel industries and in our business. Tourism and travel-related industries continue to\nface significant disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the U.S. government and individual states and local jurisdictions as well as foreign countries have taken, and in light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, will likely continue to take, actions to curb the spread of COVID-19, including encouraging or mandating social distancing and quarantines, mandating certain business closures, limiting the number of individuals that may gather in one location and implementing travel restrictions. COVID-19 has also caused, and will likely continue to cause, volatility in the equity markets and the capital markets, generally.\nOur business has been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19. In response to COVID-19, we temporarily closed our resorts in mid-March 2020 across the globe and suspended our vacation ownership sales and marketing operations. Our temporary resort and sales center closures led to significant declines in our VOI sales during this closure period. We also experienced an increase in cancellations and a decrease in bookings for our travel and membership business. As a result of these closures, we reduced our workforce and furloughed or laid off approximately 9,000 employees in March 2020, and an additional 1,400 employees during the remainder of the year. Given the magnitude of these events, our revenues were negatively impacted and we incurred $385 million of charges directly related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had reopened 81% of our resorts and the majority of these resorts have re-opened to full capacity following local health guidelines. Approximately 5,300 employees remained laid off or furloughed at December 31, 2020. We have reopened 86% of our sales offices; however, revenue has not returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. While the levels of restrictions on operations imposed by governmental authorities have reduced in most locations, there is continued uncertainty regarding restrictions going forward, which could cause additional resort and sales center closures or other restrictions or interruptions, increases in cancellations or reduction in bookings and reluctance of customers to travel.\nThe duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our resort and sales centers and our ability to implement our growth strategy is uncertain, as the impact and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve. Continued closure and/or reclosure of resorts and sales centers could result in additional COVID-19 charges, including idle pay for certain sales and marketing employees, and could result in potential further impairment of assets. If the impact of COVID-19 continues or worsens, our revenues will continue to be negatively impacted.\nThe actions we have taken to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency, including the layoff and furloughing of a substantial number of our employees and further changes we may make in the future to reduce costs, have caused and may continue to cause us to experience operational challenges, including as a result of furloughed employees not returning to employment because they have obtained alternative employment or otherwise, and may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain associates, our reputation and market share. In addition, the increase in the number of our employees working remotely has increased certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, greater potential for phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, and any failure to effectively manage these risks and to timely identify and respond to any cyberattacks may adversely affect our business. The pandemic may also have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working, which may present operational challenges that could adversely affect our business. Working remotely has caused strain for, and may adversely impact the productivity of, certain employees, which conditions, if prolonged, could harm our business. Additionally, efforts to re-open our offices safely may not be successful, could expose our personnel to health risks and will involve additional financial burdens.\nIn addition, increases in unemployment due to COVID-19 as well as decreases in consumer confidence and the continuation of the measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus may continue to negatively impact our VOI owners\u2019 ability to repay their contract receivables. If unemployment rates increase and/or our collection experience for our vacation ownership contract receivables (\u201cVOCRs\u201d) declines more than we estimated, we may need to further increase our allowance for loan losses for VOCRs. The additional $205 million allowance recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, provided our estimated impact of a prolonged recession, but we cannot assure that additional charges may not be required in the future.\nThere remains significant uncertainty concerning the current and future impact of the pandemic on the U.S. and global economy, consumer confidence, leisure travel, the timeshare industry and our business. Some of these uncertainties and risks may include the following:\n\u2022resurgences, continued high rates of infection, and increased death rates related to COVID-19, including in regions and locations where we have a significant number of resorts;\n\u2022uncertainty regarding the ongoing length and severity of the economic downturn caused by COVID-19;\n\u2022changes in federal, state and local policies, rules and regulations which could change or otherwise impact our safety protocols and measures intended to protect our owners, guests, and team members;\n\u2022continued significant governmental restrictions, recommendations and warnings against travel, including in or to areas or locations where we have a significant number of resorts, as well as between the U.S. and other countries, including restrictions placed by foreign governments on U.S. citizens traveling to their countries;\n\u2022continued closures and/or curtailment of operations at many popular tourist and entertainment center destinations, reducing the demand for leisure travel;\n\u2022changing behavior of individuals and decrease in willingness to travel and stay at resorts, timeshares and other lodging facilities due to the pandemic, which may continue beyond when global health and safety conditions improve and vaccines become generally available;\n\u2022whether the steps we have taken, and in the future may continue to take, to reduce our operating costs and improve operating efficiencies, including furloughs and headcount reductions, may negatively impact the image of our brands, sales of VOIs, and our near-term and long-term financial results;\n\u2022our inability to predict the length of time it will take for our properties to return to normal operations;\n\u2022whether certain of the operating practices and efficiencies we have adopted in response to the pandemic, such as virtual tours, will be successful during the continuance of the pandemic or thereafter;\n\u2022our in-person tours materially decreased during 2020 and we expect will continue to be at depressed levels into 2021, and our VOI sales can be expected to be negatively impacted until in-person tours return to normal levels;\n\u2022we reduced project inventory and capital expenditures in 2020 in response to the pandemic, which may adversely impact future revenues;\n\u2022average number of members in our Travel and Membership segment was down significantly in 2020, and we expect this trend to continue into 2021;\n\u2022we raised FICO requirements for new owners, which is expected to strengthen our portfolio but which may adversely impact VOI sales;\n\u2022continued increased unemployment levels resulting from the pandemic may continue to impact consumer confidence and leisure travel;\n\u2022leisure travel may take longer to recover than expected following a return to normalcy, and we may see increases in cancellations or reductions in bookings, even after all government restrictions and recommendations are no longer in effect, the risks associated with the pandemic decrease and vaccines become generally available, due to reluctance to engage in discretionary spending or otherwise;\n\u2022our telesales activities during the continuance of the pandemic may not be as successful as we expect;\n\u2022owner defaults, delinquencies and payment delays may increase if the U.S. and global economies and consumer confidence do not rebound to pre-pandemic levels;\n\u2022there is no assurance that, post-pandemic, owner upgrades will return to levels which existed pre-pandemic;\n\u2022our urban resort locations may be slower to recover to pre-pandemic levels than resorts in other locations;\n\u2022potential cases of infection and transmission at our resorts despite the implementation of our safety measure efforts, which would be disruptive and may lead to exposure to assertions of liability; and\n\u2022other actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic that may result in investigations, legal claims (regardless of merit) or litigation against us.\nEach of these uncertainties, risks and events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may cause a significantly negative impact on our future business and financial results, and we are unable to predict the full extent or nature of these impacts at this time. While we have made and continue to make efforts to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, and as a result, our future business, financial condition and results of operations may be significantly negatively impacted. The volatile conditions stemming from COVID-19, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this Item 1A, which in turn could significantly negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Further, COVID-19 may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our credit facilities and securitization facilities.\nGiven a range of different scenarios related to the COVID-19 impact on our business, we expect to maintain adequate liquidity. However, the effects of COVID-19 may negatively affect our ability to comply with existing covenants under our debt agreements, increase our cost of capital or make additional capital more difficult to obtain or available only on terms less favorable to us, if at all. Subject to the provisions of the amendment to our credit agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement Amendment\u201d), our secured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least 2.5 to 1.0 as of the measurement date and a maximum first lien leverage ratio not to exceed 4.25 to 1.0 as of the measurement date. However, the Credit Agreement Amendment establishes a relief period with respect to our secured revolving credit facility, which began on July 15, 2020, and will last until the earlier of April 1, 2022, and the termination by us of the relief period, subject to certain conditions (\u201cRelief Period\u201d). The Credit Agreement Amendment increases the leverage-based financial covenant by varying levels for each applicable quarter during the Relief Period, in each case which represents an increase to the existing leverage-based financial covenant of 4.25 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2020, the Credit Agreement Amendment increased the maximum first lien leverage ratio to 7.50 to 1.0. Following the Relief Period, the Credit Agreement Amendment re-establishes the existing leverage-based financial covenant of 4.25 to 1.0, tested on the basis of trailing 12-month consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). In addition, the Credit Agreement Amendment, among other things, increases the interest rate applicable to borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility based on our first lien leverage ratio in any quarter if it exceeds 4.25 to 1.0, until the end of the Relief Period; adds a new minimum liquidity covenant, tested quarterly until the end of the Relief Period, of (i) $250 million plus (ii) 50% of the aggregate amount of dividends paid after the Amendment Effective Date and on or prior to the last day of the relevant fiscal quarter and requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of not less than 2.00 to 1.0, which shall increase to 2.50 to 1.0 after the Relief Period, the level existing prior to the Amendment Effective Date. Finally, the Credit Agreement Amendment amends the definition of \u201cMaterial Adverse Effect\u201d in the credit agreement to take into consideration the COVID-19 pandemic during the Relief Period, to the extent disclosed prior to July 15, 2020, in our public filings and certain other specified materials. The continued impact of COVID-19 on our industry and business may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these debt covenants in the future. If we fail to comply with our debt covenants, including as amended by the Credit Agreement Amendment during the Relief Period, the lenders under our secured revolving credit facility and term loan B, subject to our right to cure, would have the right to terminate and declare the outstanding loans to be immediately due and payable, and any such default could trigger a cross-default, acceleration or other consequences under other indebtedness or financial instruments to which we are a party. Any continued impact of COVID-19 on our industry and business will also lead to a higher first lien leverage ratio in the future.\nThe interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) by consolidated interest expense (as defined in the credit agreement), both as measured on a trailing 12-month basis preceding the measurement date. As of December 31, 2020, our interest coverage ratio was 3.0 to 1.0. The first lien leverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated first lien debt (as defined in the credit agreement) as of the measurement date by consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) as measured on a trailing 12-month basis preceding the measurement date. As of December 31, 2020, our first lien leverage ratio was 5.4 to 1.0. These ratios do not include interest expense or indebtedness related to any qualified securitization financing (as defined in the credit agreement). As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants described above. Under the credit agreement, if our first lien leverage ratio exceeds 4.25 to 1.0, the interest rate on revolver borrowings would increase, and we would be subject to higher fees associated with our letters of credit. Given the first lien leverage ratio at December 31, 2020 the interest rate on the revolver borrowings will increase 25 basis points effective March 1, 2021.\nCOVID-19 has also impacted the public asset-backed securities market, and thus impacts our ability to issue asset-backed securities. In April 2020, we successfully closed on a $325 million private securitization financing at a higher cost compared to transactions we have completed in the past, though it was favorable to similar transactions completed in the public market at that time. In August 2020, we successfully closed on a $575 million securitization financing at a similar cost compared to transactions we have completed in the past. The impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets may have an impact on the availability of this type of funding and other types of financing in the near term or longer term and terms for hospitality/travel-related companies may command a higher interest rate. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 on our operations could have a significant negative impact on our financial results, capital and liquidity, as well as our credit rating, and such negative impact could continue well beyond the containment of such outbreak.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $690 million of availability under our asset-backed conduit facilities. Any further disruption to the asset-backed securities market could negatively impact our ability to obtain asset-backed financings or the terms of such financings. Our liquidity, as it relates to our VOCRs securitization program, could be adversely affected if we were to fail to renew or replace our conduit facilities on their expiration dates, or if a particular receivables pool were to fail to meet certain ratios, which could occur in certain instances if the default rates or other credit metrics of the underlying VOCRs deteriorate as a result of the COVID-19 crisis or otherwise. Our ability to sell securities backed by our VOCRs depends on the continued\nability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities, which may be negatively affected by COVID-19 and its impact on economic conditions and the credit of our VOCRs pools.\nIn connection with the sale of our European vacation rentals business, Wyndham Hotels provided certain post-closing credit support in the form of guarantees. As part of this agreement Wyndham Hotels is required to maintain minimum credit ratings which increased to Ba1 for Moody\u2019s and BB+ for S&P. In April 2020, S&P downgraded Wyndham Hotels\u2019 credit rating from BB+ to BB. Although any ultimate exposure relative to indemnities retained from the European vacation rentals sale will be shared two-thirds by Travel + Leisure and one-third by Wyndham Hotels, as the selling entity, we are responsible for administering additional security to enhance corporate guarantees in the event either company falls below a certain credit rating threshold.\nAs a result of the Wyndham Hotels credit ratings downgrade, we posted \u00a358 million surety bond and a \u00a336 million letter of credit ($79 million and $48 million as of December 31, 2020) and we will maintain them until such time that either companies\u2019 S&P and Moody\u2019s credit rating improves to BB+/Ba1. In addition, as a result of Moody\u2019s downgrading our credit rating from Ba2 to Ba3 in May 2020, the coupon rate on the 5.65% notes due 2024, the 6.60% notes due 2025, and the 6.00% notes due 2027 each increased by 25 basis points per annum, effective October 1, 2020. Since issuance, the interest rates on these notes have increased 150 basis points as of December 31, 2020, with the maximum potential additional increase at 50 basis points.\nWe utilize surety bonds in our vacation ownership business for sales and development transactions in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states. The availability, terms and conditions and pricing of bonding capacity are dependent on, among other things, continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing the bonding capacity, general availability of such capacity and our corporate credit rating. As a result of COVID-19, we could see a reduction in commitments from our surety providers. Any such reduction in commitments or reduced availability of bonding capacity, or a negative change to the terms and conditions and pricing of the bonding capacity, may negatively impact our vacation ownership business.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nThe Spin-off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nWhile we did receive a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that we and Wyndham Hotels were adequately capitalized immediately after the Spin-off, the Spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor could claim that we did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Spin-off, and that the Spin-off left us insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that we intended or believed we would incur debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the Spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning the assets or the shares of common stock in Wyndham Hotels being distributed as part of the Spin-off or providing us with a claim for money damages against the spun-off business in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by us and the fair market value of Wyndham Hotels at the time of the Spin-off.\nFollowing completion of the Spin-off, our success depends in part on our ongoing relationship with Wyndham Hotels.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a number of agreements with Wyndham Hotels that govern the ongoing relationships between Wyndham Hotels and Travel + Leisure following the Spin-off. Our success will depend, in part, on the maintenance of these ongoing relationships with Wyndham Hotels as well as Wyndham Hotels\u2019 performance of its obligations under these agreements. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Wyndham Hotels, or if Wyndham Hotels does not perform its obligations under these agreements, fails to protect the trademarks, trade names and intellectual property that we license from it or if these brands deteriorate or materially change in an adverse manner, or the reputation of these brands declines, our brand may be negatively affected, our profitability and revenues could decrease and our growth potential may be adversely affected.\nWe are responsible for certain contingent and other corporate liabilities incurred prior to the Spin-off.\nIn accordance with the agreements we entered into with Wyndham Hotels in connection with the Spin-off, Wyndham Hotels assumed one-third and Travel + Leisure assumed two-thirds of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of Wyndham Worldwide incurred prior to the distribution, including liabilities of Wyndham Worldwide related to certain terminated or divested businesses, certain general corporate matters, and any actions with respect to the separation plan. See Note 29-\nTransactions with Former Parent and Former Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our obligations related to Wyndham Hotels.\nIf Wyndham Hotels was to default on its obligations, we would be required to pay the amounts in default. Accordingly, we could under certain circumstances be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our share of the assumed obligations related to such liabilities including associated costs.\nCertain directors who serve on our Board also serve on the board of directors of and own common stock of Wyndham Hotels.\nCertain directors who serve on our Board currently serve as directors of and own shares of common stock of Wyndham Hotels following the Spin-off, which may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest, in particular when our or Wyndham Hotels\u2019 management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Wyndham Hotels, including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Spin-off and the relationship between us and Wyndham Hotels after the Spin-off or any other commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and Wyndham Hotels.\nIf the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, then our shareholders, we and Wyndham Hotels might be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nIn conjunction with the Distribution, we received opinions of our Spin-off tax advisors to the effect that, subject to the assumptions and limitations described therein, the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code in which no gain or loss is recognized by us or our shareholders, except, in the case of our shareholders, for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The opinions of our Spin-off tax advisors were based on and relied on, among other things, certain assumptions as well as on the continuing accuracy of certain factual representations and statements that we and Wyndham Hotels made to the Spin-off tax advisors and certain covenants that Travel + Leisure and Wyndham Hotels entered into, including covenants contained in the Tax Matters Agreement described below. If any of these representations or statements are or become inaccurate or incomplete, or if Travel + Leisure or Wyndham Hotels breach any of such covenants, the Distribution and such related transactions might not qualify for such tax treatment. The opinions of the Spin-off tax advisors are not binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the validity of the distribution and such related transactions as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code eligible for tax-free treatment, or that any such challenge ultimately will not prevail.\nIn addition, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax aspects of transactions related to the Spin-off (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d). Although the IRS Ruling generally is binding on the IRS, the continued validity of the IRS Ruling will be based upon and subject to the continuing accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by us. The IRS Ruling is limited to specified aspects of the Spin-off under Sections 355 and 361 of the Code and does not represent a determination by the IRS that all of the requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied.\nIf the Distribution does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including as a result of a breach of a representation or covenant, we would recognize a substantial gain attributable to Wyndham Hotels for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of our consolidated group at the time of the Spin-off (including the hotel business) would be jointly and severally liable for the entire resulting amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability. Additionally, if the distribution of the common stock of Wyndham Hotels does not qualify as tax-free under Section 355 of the Code, our shareholders will be treated as having received a taxable distribution equal to the value of the stock distributed, treated as a taxable dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, and then would have a tax-free basis recovery up to the amount of their tax basis in their shares, and then would have taxable gain from the sale or exchange of the shares to the extent of any excess.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our shares of common stock may continue to fluctuate.\nThe trading price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control including our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to seasonality and other factors related to our business; our ability or perceived ability\nto realize the benefits of the Spin-off; our credit ratings, including the impact of the Spin-off and the global COVID-19 pandemic on such ratings; changes in accounting principles or rules; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; the lack of securities analysts covering our common stock; changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; overall market fluctuations; and general economic conditions. Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and under Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of Travel + Leisure which could impact the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions include that shareholders do not have the right to act by written consent, rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings, the right of our Board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors. Delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program.\nThere can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash or surplus under Delaware law to be able to continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or lack of available capital. Our Board may also suspend the payment of dividends or our share repurchase program if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our shareholders. During 2020, in response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, our Board, acting prudently, reduced our dividend and suspended our share repurchase program. While we expect to continue to pay dividends to shareholders during the continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a continuance of dividends is permitted under our modified credit facilities subject to certain conditions, we cannot assure that our Board may not need to consider further dividend reductions in the future in response to continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 91392, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "WYND"}
