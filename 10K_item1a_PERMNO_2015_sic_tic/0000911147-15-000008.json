{"cik": "911147", "company": "CENTURY CASINOS INC /CO/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur short and long-term success is subject to many factors beyond our control. If any of the following risks, or any risks described elsewhere in or incorporated by reference in this report, actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nWe face significant competition, and if we are not able to compete successfully, our results of operations will be harmed.\nWe face intense competition from other casinos in jurisdictions in which we operate and from destination venues. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do. We seek to compete through promotion of our players\u2019 clubs and other marketing efforts. For example, for our casino in Edmonton, Canada we emphasize the casino\u2019s showroom, heated parking, players\u2019 club program, and superior service. These marketing efforts may not be successful, which could hurt our competitive position. The markets in which we operate are generally not destination resort areas and rely on a local customer base as well as tourists during peak seasons. The number of casinos in our markets may exceed demand, which could make it difficult for us to sustain profitability.\nThe gaming industry is highly fragmented and characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout much of the world. Competitive gaming activities include casinos, video lottery terminals and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Other jurisdictions may legalize gaming or liberalize their gaming rules in the near future. Although the future of Internet gaming is still uncertain, there has been increased discussion about potential legalized Internet gaming in the U.S. at the national or state levels, in part due to an interest in raising tax revenue. For example, Nevada recently enacted new regulations to allow the state\u2019s casino companies to operate Internet poker websites limited to players within Nevada\u2019s borders, and the U.S. Department of Justice released an opinion that the Interstate Wire Act of 1961 applies only to sports-related gambling activities in interstate and foreign commerce. This opinion, in conjunction with the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, may increase non-sport related Internet gambling. Currently, Internet gaming is not allowed in the jurisdictions in which we operate. However, any additional gaming opportunities that become available in our markets could attract players that might otherwise have visited our casinos. The resulting loss of revenue at our casinos may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion of existing gaming operations. New or expanded operations by other entities in any of the markets in which we operate will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. We are particularly vulnerable to competition in Colorado and Poland. If other gaming operations were permitted to open closer to Colorado Springs or Denver, our operations in Cripple Creek and Central City, respectively, could be substantially harmed, which would have a material adverse effect on us. The Polish Minister of Finance has granted a number of additional gaming licenses in recent years, and these and any additional gaming licenses could adversely affect our Polish operations.\nIn addition, capital expenditures, such as room refurbishments, amenity upgrades and new gaming equipment may be necessary from time to time to preserve the competitiveness of our properties. The gaming industries in which we operate are competitive and we expect them to become more competitive in the future. If cash from operations is insufficient to provide for needed levels of capital expenditures and we are unable to raise funds for such purposes elsewhere, we may be unable to make necessary improvements and our facilities may be less attractive to our visitors than those of our competitors, causing us to lose our competitive position.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities, which involve considerable expense and could harm our business.\nAs owners and operators of gaming facilities, we are subject to extensive state, local, and international provincial regulation. State, local and provincial authorities require us and our subsidiaries to demonstrate suitability to obtain and retain various licenses and require that we have registrations, permits and approvals to conduct gaming operations. Various regulatory authorities may, for any reason set forth in applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. In Canada, our licenses must be renewed every five years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2018 for our casinos in both Edmonton and Calgary. In Colorado, our licenses must be renewed every two years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2015 for our casinos in both Central City and Cripple Creek. In Poland, our licenses must be renewed every six years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2016 for both the Lim Center casino in Warsaw and the Katowice casino. We may not be able to obtain such renewals or approvals. Regulatory authorities may also levy substantial fines against us or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. Any of these events could force us to terminate operations at an existing gaming facility, either on a temporary or permanent basis, could result in us being fined or could prohibit us from successfully completing a project in which we invest. Closing facilities or an inability to expand may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising.\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.\nWe face extensive taxation from gaming and regulatory authorities. Potential changes to the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe believe that the prospect of significant revenue to a jurisdiction through taxation and fees is one of the primary reasons jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, provincial, local and provincial income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. For instance, the Colorado constitution permits a gaming tax of up to 40% on adjusted gross gaming proceeds. The current gaming tax in Colorado established by the Colorado Gaming Commission is a graduated rate of 0.25% to 20% on adjusted gross gaming proceeds, where casinos pay a higher percentage as their adjusted gross proceeds increase. At our Edmonton and Calgary casinos, the AGLC retains 85% of slot machine net sales, of which the AGLC allocated 15% to licensed charities. For all table games in Alberta, Canada, excluding poker and craps, we are required to allocate 50% of our net win to a charity designated by the AGLC. For poker and craps in Alberta, Canada, we are required to allocate 25% of our net win to the charity. At the REC, the AGLC will retain 33% of slot machine net sales which are allocated to the Alberta Lottery Fund. During the first five years of the REC\u2019s operations, the HRA will retain 23.25% of slot machine net sales to fund animal welfare programs, purses, breed improvement programs, marketing, and administration and backstretch programs. After the first five years of operations at the REC, the HRA will retain 26.25% of slot machine net sales. The Polish Minister of Finance assesses a gaming tax rate on gross gaming revenue of 50%. In addition, negative economic conditions could intensify the efforts of federal, state, provincial and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes or introduction of additional gaming opportunities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPotential changes in the regulatory environment may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nFrom time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or that may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of the gaming industry that results in increased competition and any restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to record an impairment of our assets. In particular, in Colorado, there have been repeated attempts to expand gambling beyond Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek to other towns, racetracks, bingo halls, and tribal gaming through legislation, ballot initiatives, and administrative action by state or local agencies and this is a continued competitive threat to us. Periodic changes in the membership of the Colorado Gaming Commission and turnover in the office of the Governor of Colorado (who appoints both the members of the Gaming Commission and the executive director of the Department of Revenue, which oversees the Gaming Commission) also could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations or potential acquisitions.\nOur operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our casinos and most of our revenue is essentially cash-based. Our industry is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing, fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development. While we have a significant amount of cash currently on hand, we may not be able to obtain funding when we need it on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to finance our current or future expansion projects, we will have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expansion, development and renovation projects and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners, or modifying our bank credit facility. In addition, the amount of capital that we are able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control, such as the share price of our stock and its trading volume. Funding may be impacted by the global economic, credit and stock market conditions. As a result, we may not be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, in a timely manner or at all. If we are able to consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs and may be highly dilutive to our current stockholders. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to reduce, dispose of or eliminate certain operations.\nOur financing agreements in Canada and Poland impose restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility, and a default could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur various credit agreements require us to adhere to a number of significant financial covenants. These restrictions limit the ability of our subsidiaries\u2019 in Canada and Poland to incur additional debt, obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. A breach of any covenant in any of our credit agreements would result in an event of default under that agreement after any applicable grace periods. An event of default, if not waived or cured, could cause the lender to accelerate the repayment of all outstanding amounts due under the agreement, foreclose on the security granted under the agreement and enforce the Company\u2019s obligations under its guarantee. There can be no assurances that we or our subsidiaries would be able to obtain a waiver of an event of default or modification of a covenant if necessary, or otherwise obtain alternative sources of funding to repay the obligation if a default occurred. Any such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have made a loan to the REC project in Calgary, and if the loan defaults, our business may be adversely affected.\nCCE has agreed to loan to CDR up to CAD 24 million for the exclusive use of developing and operating the REC project as various stages of the REC are completed. As of December 31, 2014, CCE has loaned CDR CAD 18.6 million ($16.0 million based on the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2014). The loan is secured by the assets of the project. If the project is not completed and loan advances have been made, CCE would have the right to foreclose on any assets purchased. However, in those circumstances the value of the project assets may not be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding loan amount. In addition, the REC project may not be successful, which would adversely affect CDR\u2019s ability to repay the loan. The failure of CDR to repay the loan could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including limiting our ability to repay additional monies borrowed under the BMO Credit Agreement.\nWe intend to develop and operate additional properties in the future and if our development efforts are not successful, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe regularly review opportunities to develop new properties. We may not be successful in obtaining the rights to develop such properties, and as a result, we may incur significant costs for which we will receive no return. Even if we are successful in obtaining the rights to develop new casino properties, commencing operations at new casino projects may require substantial development capital. This is the case, for example, with the development of the REC project in Calgary. Development activities involve expenses and risks, including expenses involved in securing licenses, permits or authorizations other than those required from gaming regulators, and the risk of potential cost over-runs, construction delays, and market deterioration. Additional risks before commencing operations include the time and expense incurred and unforeseen difficulties in obtaining suitable sites, liquor licenses, building permits, materials, competent and able contractors, supplies, employees, gaming devices and related matters.\nWe may pursue gaming opportunities that would require us to obtain a gaming license. While our management believes that we are licensable in any jurisdiction that allows gaming operations, each licensing process is unique and requires a significant amount of funds and management time. The licensing process in any particular jurisdiction can take significant time and expense through licensing fees, background investigation costs, fees of counsel and other associated preparation costs. Moreover, if we proceed with a licensing approval process with industry partners, such industry partners would be subject to regulatory review as well. We seek to find industry partners that are licensable, but cannot assure that such partners will, in fact, be licensable. Certain licenses include competitive situations where, even if we and our industry partners are licensable, other factors such as the economic impact of gaming, financial and operational capabilities of competitors must be analyzed by regulatory authorities. In addition, political factors may make the licensing process more difficult. If any of our gaming license applications are denied, we may have to write off costs related to our investment in such application processes, which could be significant. In addition, our ability to attract and retain competent management and employees for any new location is critical to our success. One or more of these risks may result in any new gaming opportunity not being successful. If we are not able to successfully commence operations at these properties, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may experience construction delays during our expansion or development projects, including the development costs associated with the REC project in Calgary, which could adversely affect our operations.\nFrom time to time we may commence construction projects at our properties. Construction on the REC project in Calgary, Alberta, Canada commenced in March 2014, and we expect to open the REC in April 2015. In addition, we may engage in additional construction projects as part of our expansion in the future. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Most of these factors are beyond our control.\nOur current and future projects could also experience:\n\u00b7\nfailure to obtain necessary licenses, permits, entitlements or other governmental approvals;\n\u00b7\nchanges to plans and specifications (including changes for the REC project in Calgary, some of which may require the approval of the AGLC);\n\u00b7\ndelays and significant cost increases;\n\u00b7\nshortages of materials;\n\u00b7\nshortages of skilled labor or work stoppages for contractors and subcontractors;\n\u00b7\nlabor disputes or work stoppages;\n\u00b7\ndisputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;\n\u00b7\nhealth and safety incidents and site accidents;\n\u00b7\nengineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;\n\u00b7\npoor performance or nonperformance by our partners or other third parties on whom we place reliance;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming and other facilities, real estate development or construction projects;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental issues, including the discovery of unknown environmental contamination;\n\u00b7\nweather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses; and\n\u00b7\nother unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of our construction projects, including the REC project in Calgary, or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of our construction projects. This could materially adversely affect our plan of operations, financial condition and ability to satisfy our debt obligations. In addition, construction at our operating casinos may disrupt our customer\u2019s experience and cause a decline in our revenue.\nActual costs and construction periods for any of our projects can differ significantly from initial expectations. We can provide no assurance that we will complete any project on time, if at all, or within established budgets, or that any project will result in increased earnings to us. If our initial budgets are not accurate, we may need to pursue additional financing to complete a proposed project, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. The adverse impact on our results of operations resulting from cost overruns on any construction projects we undertake may harm our stock prices.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may face disruption in integrating and managing facilities we open or acquire in the future, which could adversely impact our operations.\nWe continually evaluate opportunities to open new properties, some of which are potentially significant in relation to our size. We expect to continue pursuing expansion opportunities, and we could face significant challenges in managing and integrating expanded or combined operations resulting from our expansion activities. The integration of any new properties we open or acquire in the future will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from the day-to-day business of our existing operations, which may interrupt the activities of those operations and could result in deteriorating performance from those operations. For example, in 2013 we acquired majority ownership in CPL and are currently integrating CPL into our operations, including its internal control structure. Management of new properties, especially in new geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial staff, which would increase our expenses.\nDifficulties in managing our worldwide operations may have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn 2014, we derived our revenue principally from operations located on two continents and on cruise ships operating around the world. Our management is located in the United States and Europe. Our worldwide operations pose risks to our business, especially for a smaller company such as ours. Risks associated with international operations include:\n\u00b7\ndifferent time zones;\n\u00b7\nculture, management and language differences;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws and policies that govern our foreign operations;\n\u00b7\npossible failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in establishing staffing and managing non-United States operations;\n\u00b7\ndifferent labor regulations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in environmental, health and safety laws;\n\u00b7\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u00b7\neconomic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and\n\u00b7\nuncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.\nThese factors make it more challenging to manage and administer a globally-dispersed business and, as a result, we must devote greater resources to operating under several regulatory and legislative regimes (See \u201cGovernmental Regulation and Licensing\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d). This business model also increases our costs.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nInvestments in additional properties that are not wholly-owned by the Company may decrease our ability to manage risk.\nWe have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, as a business partner or co-venturer in certain gaming opportunities. For example, we have a 66.6% ownership interest in CPL, which owns and operates nine casinos throughout Poland, and Polish Airports owns the remaining 33.3% of CPL. In addition, we have a 15% ownership interest in CDR, which will operate the Century Downs Racetrack and Casino upon completion of its construction, and unaffiliated shareholders currently own the remaining 85% of CDR. Under the amended credit agreement with CDR, we control the CDR board of directors and have the right to convert CAD 11 million of a loan to CDR into an additional 60% ownership interest in CDR. Business partners often have shared control over the operation of the business\u2019s assets. Therefore, the operation of a joint venture or similar enterprise is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters and our inability to take action without the approval of our partners. In addition, these investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the business partner or co-venturer might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a business partner or co-venturer might subject assets owned by the business to additional risk.\nOur reputation and business may be harmed by cyber security breaches, and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers', our business partners' or our own information or other breaches of our information security.\nWe make use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for marketing and promotional purposes, is a critical element of our operations. Our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws as well as the applicable laws in other countries in which we operate. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests.\nOur information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, or those of service providers, or our employee or business information may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or by actions or inactions by our employees. As a result, information of our customers, third party service providers or business partners or our business information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their or our consent. Non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in a loss of customers and subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. If a cyber security breach were to occur, it could have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be adversely affected by reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of consumer concerns over economic conditions, homeland security, terrorism and war.\nOur business may be adversely affected by international, national and local economic and political conditions. The volatile global economic environment has had and is continuing to have negative effects on our business because our business is largely impacted by discretionary consumer spending. Reductions in discretionary consumer spending or changes in consumer preferences brought about by factors such as increased unemployment, significant increases in energy prices, perceived or actual deterioration in general economic conditions, housing market instability, bank failures and the potential for additional bank failures, perceived or actual decline in disposable consumer income and wealth, and changes in consumer confidence in the economy could reduce customer demand for the leisure activities we offer and may adversely affect our revenue and operating cash flow. We are unable to predict the frequency, length or severity of economic circumstances.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties and have had a negative impact on travel and leisure expenditures, including gaming, lodging and tourism. For example, our locations in Poland are in close proximity to Ukraine and Russia. While we have not experienced any material impact from the acts of hostility between the two countries, an increase in those hostilities could adversely affect our casinos in Poland. We cannot predict the extent to which terrorism, security alerts or war, or hostilities in countries throughout the world will directly or indirectly affect our business and operating results.\nWe experience seasonal fluctuations that significantly impact our quarterly operating results.\nWeather patterns and holidays affect our operations. For example, our Colorado casinos, which are located in mountain tourist towns, typically experience greater gaming revenue in the summer tourist season than any other time during the year. During the year ended December 31, 2014, net operating revenue attributable to our Colorado operations fluctuated from a low of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter to a high of $7.3 million in the third quarter. If we are not able to offset these seasonal declines with additional revenue from other properties, our quarterly results may suffer.\nInclement weather and other conditions could seriously disrupt our business, which may hamper our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reductions in the number of customers who visit our properties because of severe weather conditions. If weather conditions limit access to our casino properties or otherwise adversely impact our ability to operate our casinos at full capacity, our revenue will suffer, which will negatively impact our operating results. High winds, flooding, blizzards and sub-zero temperatures, such as those experienced in Colorado, Alberta and Poland from time to time, can limit access to our properties.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future.\nWe may suffer damage to our property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism), that could severely disrupt our business or subject us to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although we maintain insurance customary in our industry, including property, casualty, terrorism and business interruption insurance, that insurance is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitations on the coverage period for business interruption. Due to these variables, we may not be able to fully insure such losses, or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from severe weather conditions. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to heavy losses if any damages occur, directly or indirectly, that could have a significant adverse impact on our operations.\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage or self-insure. Among other factors, regional political tensions, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits), additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed by work stoppages and other labor issues.\nThere are 157 employees at our CPL casinos in Poland who belong to trade unions. The trade unions do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with CPL. A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at our casino properties in Poland could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our employees in the U.S. and Canada are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, we have experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees. If a union seeks to organize any of our employees, we could experience disruption in our business and incur significant costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. If a union were successful in organizing any of our employees, we could experience significant increases in our labor costs which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency controls in foreign countries could adversely affect our business.\nOur casinos in Canada and Poland represent a significant portion of our business, and the revenue generated and expenses incurred by these operations are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and Polish zloty, respectively. A decrease in the value of either of these currencies in relation to the value of the U.S. dollar would decrease the operating profit from our foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars, which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. In addition, we may expand our operations into other countries and, accordingly, we could face similar exchange rate risk with respect to the costs of doing business in such countries as a result of any increases in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies of such countries. We do not currently hedge our exposure to fluctuations of these foreign currencies, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully hedge any future foreign currency exposure.\nWe have invested $1 million in capital in the MCE project located in Argentina. In addition, we have a Consulting Services Agreement with MCE in which CCE will receive a service fee consisting of of a fixed fee plus a percentage of MCE\u2019s EBITDA. Argentina has implemented currency controls within the country that could limit our ability to repatriate our initial capital, the consulting service fee, or other funds.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger, our Co Chief Executive Officers, and other members of our senior management team. The employment agreements with Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger provide that, under some circumstances, the departure of one executive could allow the other to leave for cause. Our ability to retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on us.\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from slot machines at our casinos. At our Colorado properties, we own or lease our slot machines through participation agreements. At our Canadian properties, the AGLC owns or leases slot machines through participation agreements. It is important for competitive reasons that we offer popular and up-to-date slot machine games to our guests at all of our casinos.\nSlot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell some slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation agreements in order to acquire the machines. Generally, a participation agreement is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine. Participation agreements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win.\nFor competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation agreements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines in Colorado. In Canada, the AGLC is faced with this same risk. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment and participation costs, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe may be required in the future to record impairment losses related to assets we currently carry on our balance sheet.\nWe have $159 million of tangible and intangible assets, including $12 million of goodwill, $4 million in casino licenses, $2 million in trademarks and $135 million in property and equipment as of December 31, 2014. Accounting rules require that we make certain estimates and assumptions related to our determinations as to the future recoverability of these assets. If we were to determine that the values of these assets carried on our balance sheet are impaired due to adverse changes in our business or otherwise, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the value of these assets, which would adversely affect our results during the period in which we recorded the impairment charge.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe current U.S. administration has made public statements indicating that international tax reform is a priority, and key members of the U.S. Congress have conducted hearings and proposed a wide variety of potential changes. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside of the U.S. until those earnings are repatriated to the U.S., could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. In addition, the cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the U.S. could be affected. Due to our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nUncertainties in Polish tax laws and other Polish laws and regulations may lead to additional liabilities\nPolish tax laws and other Polish laws and regulations change frequently, and often there is no reference to established regulations or cases. The current laws and regulations also have ambiguities that lead to differences in interpretations between authorities and between authorities and companies. Taxes or other payments may frequently be inspected by Polish authorities that are authorized to impose significant fines, extra liabilities and interest for underpayments. As a result, the tax risk is higher in Poland than in countries with better-developed tax systems. For example, in March 2011, the Polish Internal Revenue Service (\u201cPolish IRS\u201d) started conducting a series of tax audits of CPL to review the calculation and payment of personal income tax by CPL employees covering December 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008, January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2011 to January 31, 2011. Based on this audit, the Polish IRS concluded that CPL should calculate, collect and remit to the Polish IRS personal income tax on tips received by CPL employees from casino customers for those periods. After proceedings and appeals between CPL and the Polish IRS, the Director of the Tax Chamber in Warsaw confirmed the opinion of the Polish IRS in November 2012 for the period January 2011 and in December 2013 for the period December 2007 to December 2008 and from January 2009 to December 2009. Because of these decisions, in 2013 CPL paid PLN 3.6 million ($1.3 million) in taxes and interest for January 1, 2011 to January 31, 2011 and for January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and in 2014 CPL paid PLN 2.8 million ($0.9 million) in taxes and interest for January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 to the Polish IRS. CPL continues to appeal the decisions through the Polish court appeals process and expects a final determination in 2015. However, we believe that the Polish IRS may seek to assess a liability for all periods from January 2007 to present. Management has determined that it is reasonably possible that the litigation will be unfavorable for CPL, and we have recorded PLN 12.0 million ($3.4 million based on the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2014) as a contingent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. If the decisions of the Polish IRS are upheld, CPL may require cash injections from its shareholders, including us, or from other sources to pay the tax liabilities.\nPolish tax payments may be inspected for up to five years. As a result, the amounts included in the financial statements for Polish taxes may change at a later date after the final amounts are determined, and other Polish laws and regulations may lead to additional liabilities.\nOur failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we incur substantial expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we have performed system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If in the future, we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements or other errors and we could be required to restate our financial results. In addition, as we consolidate or open new properties we must integrate their processes and procedures into our internal control framework. Further management must evaluate their internal controls to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Integrating and evaluating new properties into our internal control framework requires additional cost and additional risk over our financial reporting.\nA material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could increase our chance of fraud, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures, each of which could negatively impact our business, profitability and financial condition. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Such sanctions or investigations would require significant additional financial and management resources, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, our business and financial condition could be harmed, and the market price of our stock could decline.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits and gaming regulatory proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities or restrictions.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect us. Our properties in Central City and Cripple Creek are located within an area of historic mining activity and near superfund sites that have been the subject of state and federal clean-up actions. Although our properties are not part of a superfund site, it is possible that, as a result of our ownership and operation of our properties (on which mining may have occurred in the past), we may incur costs related to this matter in the future. Furthermore, there may have been soil or groundwater contamination at certain of our properties resulting from current or former operations. None of these matters or other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future.\nWe are dependent upon technology services and electrical power to operate our business, and if we experience damage or service interruptions, we may have to cease some or all of our operations, resulting in a decrease in revenue.\nOur gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security system and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate. Without electrical power or a failure of the technology services needed to run the computers, we may be unable to run all or parts of our gaming operations. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Although we have designed our systems around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.\nEnergy and fuel price increases may adversely affect our costs of operations and our revenue.\nOur casino properties use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy. We expended approximately $2.1 million for utilities for all of our operations in 2014. Substantial increases in the cost of electricity and natural gas will negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, energy and fuel price increases could reduce the disposable income of our customers and cause a corresponding decrease in visitation to our properties, which would negatively impact our revenue. Fuel price increases also could discourage customers from driving to our casinos, particularly at Cripple Creek and Central City, which are not located in metropolitan areas. The extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases, but this impact could be material to our results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile and may decline significantly and unexpectedly.\nOur common stock trades in the U.S. on the NASDAQ Capital Market, which consists of relatively small issuers and a lack of significant trading volumes relative to other U.S. markets. These factors may result in volatility in the price of our common stock. For instance, the trading price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market in 2013 and 2014 varied from a high of $8.21 to a low of $2.61.\nCertain anti-takeover measures we have adopted may limit our ability to consummate transactions that some of our security holders might otherwise support.\nWe have a fair price business combination provision in our certificate of incorporation, which requires approval of certain business combinations and other transactions by holders of 80% of our outstanding shares of voting stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. These provisions generally have the effect of requiring that any party seeking to acquire us negotiate with our board of directors in order to structure a business combination with us. This may have the effect of depressing the price of our common stock due to the possibility that certain transactions that our stockholders might favor could be precluded by these provisions.\nRegulation Risk Related to Stockholders\nStockholders may be required to dispose of their shares of our common stock if they are found unsuitable by U.S. gaming authorities.\nGaming authorities in the U.S. and Canada generally can require that any beneficial owner of our common stock and other securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate an owner's suitability, and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities. Our certificate of incorporation also provides us with the right to repurchase shares of our common stock from certain beneficial owners declared by gaming regulators to be unsuitable holders of our equity securities, and the price we pay to any such beneficial owner may be below the price such beneficial owner would otherwise accept for his or her shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 79791, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "CNTY"}
