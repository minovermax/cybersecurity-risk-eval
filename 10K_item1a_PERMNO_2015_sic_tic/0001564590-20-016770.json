{"cik": "1022646", "company": "ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves certain risks. If any of the following key risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In any such circumstance and others described below, the trading price of our securities could decline and investors could lose part or all of their investment.\nWe have concluded that we need to restructure our balance sheet to continue as a going concern over the long term, and we can provide no assurances of the terms of any such restructuring transaction in which we may engage or how any such transaction will impact\nour security holders. We may need to seek relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, which could result in little or no consideration to our debt and equity holders.\nAs a result of our significant indebtedness and extremely challenging current market conditions, we believe we will require a significant restructuring of our balance sheet in order to continue as a going concern in the long term. We have based this belief on assumptions and estimates which are to some degree subjective and may vary considerably from actual results, and we could spend our available financial resources less or more rapidly than currently expected.\nIn February and March 2020, we entered into confidentiality agreements and commenced discussions with certain holders of the Company\u2019s long-term debt and their legal and financial advisors. Negotiations and discussions with certain debtholders and their advisors are ongoing, although as of the date of this filing no definitive agreements have been reached regarding any amendments, restructurings or other transactions relating to the Company\u2019s indebtedness.\nThere can be no assurance that our efforts will result in any agreement or what the terms of any agreement will be. If an agreement is reached and we pursue a restructuring, it may be necessary for us to file a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act in order to implement an agreement through the confirmation and consummation of a plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court in the bankruptcy proceedings. We also may conclude that it is necessary to initiate proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United State Bankruptcy Code to implement a restructuring of our obligations even if we are unable to reach an agreement with our creditors and other relevant parties regarding the terms of such a restructuring. In either case, such a proceeding could be commenced in the near term. If a plan of reorganization is implemented in a bankruptcy proceeding, it is possible that holders of claims and interests with respect to, or rights to acquire, our equity securities would be entitled to little or no recovery, and those claims and interests may be canceled for little or no consideration. If that were to occur, we anticipate that all or substantially all of the value of all investments in our equity securities would be lost and that our equity holders would lose all or substantially all of their investment. It is also possible that our other stakeholders, including holders of our Second Lien and Unsecured Notes, will receive little or no consideration for their claims.\nThe audit report we received with respect to our fiscal year 2019 consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement require us to deliver audited, consolidated financial statements without a going concern or like qualification or exception. As a result, unless we obtain a waiver of this requirement, subject to a 30-day grace period, we will be in default under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement after we deliver our financial statements to the lenders thereunder. Our failure to obtain a waiver of this requirement under the Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement within the applicable grace period could result in an acceleration of all of our outstanding debt obligations thereunder.\nThe sustained periods of low natural gas prices combined with the recent precipitous drop in crude oil prices and our substantial indebtedness led us to determine that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to maintain adequate liquidity through our borrowing base and commitments thereunder for the twelve month period following the issuance date of our audited, consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph with respect to this uncertainty in its report that is included with our financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnder our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, we are required to deliver audited, consolidated financial statements without a going concern or like qualification or explanation. Because the audit report prepared by our auditors with respect to the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern, we will be in default under each of the Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement on April 14, 2020 when we deliver our financial statements to the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement, respectively. We expect that we will be precluded from drawing additional amounts under the Credit Agreement while the default exists. There is a 30-day grace period related to this covenant in each of the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement. If we do not obtain a waiver or other suitable relief from the lenders under the Credit Agreement or the Term Loan Agreement before the expiration of the 30-day grace period, an event of default under the Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement would occur. At this time, we do not expect to obtain a waiver of this requirement.\nIf an event of default occurs under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, the lenders could accelerate the loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement. In addition, if the lenders under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement accelerate the loans outstanding thereunder, we will then also be in default under the indentures related to our Second Lien Notes and our Unsecured Notes. If we default under those indentures, the holders of the Second Lien Notes and Unsecured Notes could accelerate those notes.\nIf our lenders or our noteholders accelerate the payment of amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, Term Loan Agreement, Second Lien Notes, or the Unsecured Notes, respectively, we do not currently have sufficient liquidity to repay such indebtedness and would need additional sources of capital to do so. It is unlikely that we could obtain additional sources of capital from asset sales, public or private issuances of debt, equity or equity-linked securities, debt for equity swaps, or any combination thereof. If we fail to obtain sufficient additional capital to repay the outstanding indebtedness and provide sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs, it may be necessary for us to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy may be filed against us in the U.S. or in Canada. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt regarding our\nability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of our audited, consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe have significant indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are unable to comply with the financial and non-financial covenants governing our indebtedness or obtain waivers of any defaults that occur with respect to our indebtedness, or amend, replace or refinance any or all of the agreements governing our indebtedness and/or otherwise secure additional capital, we may be unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations.\nAs of April 10, 2020, we had the following principal amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, our Term Loan Facility (as defined in Note 6), our Second Lien Notes, 2022 Notes and our 2025 Notes:\n\u2022\n$43.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility;\n\u2022\n$966.3 million under the Term Loan Facility;\n\u2022\n$586.8 million with respect to the Second Lien Notes;\n\u2022\n$150.4 million with respect to the 2022 Notes; and\n\u2022\n$225.0 million with respect to the 2025 Notes.\nOur indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities, and limiting our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplacing restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to deduct our net interest expense; and\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We depend on our Revolving Credit Facility for future capital and liquidity needs, because we use operating cash flows for investing activities. To the extent future commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement decrease below the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, because of a downward redetermination of the borrowing base and commitments, the Company would be required to enter into a mandatory repayment schedule to satisfy the deficiency. Should the lenders not support such a repayment schedule, intramonth liquidity for the Company could be inadequate to meet obligations on a timely basis. In the event that the borrowing base is reduced to an amount that is less than the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, then commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility would be reduced to zero and Ultra Resources would become subject to additional coverage tests under the Term Loan Facility. Among these new requirements is an asset coverage test and, if not satisfied, Ultra Resources would be required to make mandatory prepayments to the lenders under the Term Loan Facility in order to cure any deficiency. Failure to make such required payments would result in an event of default under the Term Loan Facility.\nThere are covenants in certain agreements governing our indebtedness. In many instances, a default under one of the agreements governing our indebtedness can, if not cured or waived, result in a default under certain of our other indebtedness agreements. A default on our obligations and/or an acceleration of our indebtedness by our lenders or noteholders, as applicable, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our securities.\nThe Fifth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility removed certain financial covenants such that the Company is no longer subject to an interest coverage ratio, a current ratio, a net leverage ratio or an asset coverage ratio. However, the Fifth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility introduced a new maximum capital expenditure covenant, which limits the amount of capital expenditures the Company can make per fiscal quarter, subject to certain carry-forward rights for unused amounts.\nAdditionally, the Sixth Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility dated February 14, 2020 (i) reduced the excess cash threshold, a part of the anti-cash hoarding provisions, from $25 million to $15 million at all times borrowings are outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement and (ii) established quarterly borrowing base redeterminations, with the next redetermination occurring on July 1, 2020, and on each October 1, January 1, April 1 and July 1 thereafter.\nAs previously described, the audit report prepared by our auditors with respect to the financial statements in this Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Such inclusion is a default under the Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement. If our lenders accelerate the payment of amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility or Term Loan Facility following the expiration of the 30-day grace period, we do not currently have sufficient liquidity to repay such indebtedness and would need additional sources of capital to do so. In addition, the acceleration of the payments outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Facility could result in a cross-default under the indentures governing the Second Lien and Unsecured Notes. We could attempt to obtain additional sources of capital from asset sales, public or private issuances of debt, equity or equity-linked securities, debt for equity swaps, or any combination thereof. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in obtaining capital from such transactions on acceptable terms, or at all, and if we were unable to obtain sufficient additional capital to repay the outstanding indebtedness and sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs, it may be necessary for us to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or the Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy may be filed against us in the U.S. or in Canada.\nThe borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility may be reduced, which could limit us in the future and negatively impact our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nBased on the Sixth Amendment, the commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Facility was reduced from $120 million to $100 million with the associated borrowing base being set at $1.075 billion, effective April 1, 2020. Under the Sixth Amendment, the borrowing base is redetermined quarterly and the next borrowing base redetermination date is scheduled to be on July 1, 2020. In addition, either we or the lenders may request an interim redetermination twice per year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties. Our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower commodity prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, the issuance of new indebtedness, or for any other reason.\nAn inadequate borrowing base and/or commitment amount could potentially have an adverse impact on our liquidity and the ability to meet our financial obligations. In the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise, our ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility may be limited and we could be required to pay indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. If we are required to repay the indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility as a result of a downward borrowing base redetermination, we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets, including the market for senior unsecured notes, at commercially reasonable rates to meet our obligations, including any such debt repayment obligations.\nOur common shares were recently delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market and trade in an over-the-counter market. This may negatively affect our stock price and liquidity.\nAs previously disclosed, on August 8, 2019, our common shares were delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market. Trading in our common shares is now conducted in the over-the-counter markets on the OTC Bulletin Board and the liquidity of our common shares may likely be reduced or impaired, not only in the number of shares which could be purchased and sold, but also through delays in the timing of the transactions. There may also be a reduction in our coverage by security analysists and the news media, thereby resulting in potential lower prices for our common shares than might otherwise prevail. The delisting of our common shares may also result in other adverse consequences, including lower demand for our shares, adverse publicity and a reduced interest in our Company from investors, analysts and other market participants.\nInvestments in securities trading on the over-the-counter markets are generally less liquid than investments in securities trading on a national securities exchange. In addition, the trading of our common shares on the over-the-counter markets could have other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence in us by suppliers, customers and employees and the loss of institutional investor interest in our common shares. This could further depress the trading price of our common shares and could also have a long-term adverse effect on our ability to raise capital.\nThere can be no assurance that our common shares will continue to trade on the over-the-counter markets or that any public market for the common shares will exist in the future, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of the common shares on this market, whether the trading volume of the common shares will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market, whether quotes for the common shares may be blocked in the future, or that we will be able to relist the common shares on a national securities exchange. If we fail to remain current in our reporting requirements, the market liquidity of our securities could be harmed by impacting the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.\nIf we cannot obtain sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to continue with our business strategy.\nOur business strategy has historically included maintaining a portfolio of properties that provide long-term, profitable growth through development in areas that support sustainable, lower-risk, repeatable, high-return drilling projects. In the future, we may not be able to obtain financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when needed, which could adversely affect our operating results and prospects. Further. fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices can create fiscal challenges for the oil and gas industry. These conditions have impacted companies in the oil and gas industry and the Company\u2019s spending and operating plans and may continue to do so in the future. There may be unexpected business impacts from market uncertainty, including volatile changes in currency exchange rates, inflation, interest rates, defaults of suppliers and general levels of investing and consuming activity, as well as a potential impact on the Company\u2019s credit ratings, which could\naffect its liquidity and general ability to obtain financing. If we cannot raise the capital required to implement our historical business strategy, we may be required to curtail operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity concerns, the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies and historical emergence from bankruptcy in 2017 could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nOur substantial indebtedness, liquidity concerns, the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies and our historical emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2017 could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, employees, and suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nkey suppliers could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022\nthe ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract, motivate, and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nemployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u2022\ncompetitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial conditions, and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protections will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nTransfers or issuances of our equity may impair our ability to utilize our U.S. federal net operating losses.\nUnder U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from its taxable income net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) carried forward from prior years. We have NOL carryforwards of approximately $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our ability to utilize our U.S. federal NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce income tax liability may be substantially limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d (as defined in section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more shareholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. An \u201cownership change\u201d occurred when our chapter 11 plan of reorganization became effective. Transfers of our stock and future transactions, including potential equity issuances and liability management efforts could ultimately result in another \u201cownership change\u201d occurring in the future. Under section 382 of the Code, absent an applicable exception, if a corporation undergoes an\u201d ownership change,\u201d the amount of its pre-\u201cownership change\u201d NOLs and other tax attributes that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally will be subject to an annual limitation equal to the value of its stock immediately prior to the \u201cownership change\u201d multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate, plus, if we have a so-called \u201cnet unrealized built-in gain\u201d in our assets, an additional amount calculated based on certain actual or \u201cdeemed\u201d \u201crecognized\u201d \u201cbuilt-in gains\u201d in our assets that occur within a 5-year \u201crecognition period\u201d following an \u201cownership change.\u201d By contrast, in the event we were to determine that we will have a so-called \u201cnet unrealized built-in loss\u201d in our assets at the time an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, our \u201crecognized built-in losses\u201d during the 5-year \u201crecognition period\u201d would also become subject limitation. The IRS has proposed regulations that would substantially change the calculations regarding \u201cnet unrealized built-in gains,\u201d \u201crecognized built-in gains,\u201d \u201cnet unrealized built-in losses,\u201d and \u201crecognized built-in losses\u201d in a way that is highly taxpayer-unfavorable, but we cannot predict when and to what extent those proposed regulations will be finalized. The ownership change that occurred as a result of our exit from chapter 11 proceedings should not materially limit our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards, but it may be affected by future \u201cownership changes\u201d. In addition, under the tax reform bill commonly as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, (i) the amount of post-2017 NOLs that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year was generally limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself, and (ii) post-2017 net operating losses were not able to be carried back to prior taxable years. However, utilization of net operating losses has been temporarily expanded under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d). Under the CARES Act, (i) for taxable years beginning before 2021, NOL carryforwards and NOL carrybacks may offset 100% of taxable income, and (ii) NOLs arising in 2018, 2019, and 2020 taxable years may be carried back to each of the five preceding years to generate a refund. There can be no assurance that we will be able to utilize our U.S. federal income tax NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nOur operations and liquidity could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain required bonds or if surety companies require us to secure such bonds with cash collateral or letters of credit.\nFederal and state laws require bonds or cash deposits to secure our obligations with respect to various parts of our operations. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including: (i) our failure to comply with rules and regulations of federal and state governmental agencies, including the BLM, (ii) the lack of availability of bonding, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds; and (iii) the exercise by third-party bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the bonds. If we fail to maintain required bonds, our production may significantly decrease, which would significantly decrease our already constrained cash flow. In addition, surety companies may require us to post letters of credit or secure bonds with cash collateral as a result of our credit rating, which would adversely affect our liquidity.\nLiquidity concerns could result in a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nOur ability to obtain financings and trade credit and the terms of any financings or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit, increase our borrowing costs and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations.\nWe cannot control the future price of oil and natural gas and sustained periods of low prices could hurt our profitability and financial condition and could impair our ability to grow our business or to perform the obligations in our agreements, including the agreements governing our indebtedness.\nSustained periods of low commodity prices will adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Our revenues, profitability, liquidity, ability to raise capital for our business, future growth, ability to operate, develop and explore our properties, and the carrying value of our properties depend heavily on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.\nNatural gas comprised approximately 96% of our total production and 86% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 96% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2019. Historically, natural gas prices have been highly volatile, including in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States where the vast majority of our natural gas is produced. Prices have been affected by actions of federal, state and local governments and agencies, foreign governments, national and international economic and political conditions, levels of consumer demand, weather conditions, domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, the price and availability of equipment, materials and personnel to conduct operations, and the price and availability of alternative fuels. These external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of natural gas. Any substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including reduced cash flow and borrowing capacity, and lower proved reserves. Price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on potential acquisitions and development and exploration projects, and sustained lower gas prices have caused and may, in the future continue to cause, us or the operators of properties in which we have ownership interests to curtail projects and limit or suspend drilling, completion or even production activities.\nCrude oil comprised approximately 4% of our total production and 13% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and represented 4% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2019. In the future, crude oil prices may remain at current levels or fall to lower levels. If crude oil prices remain at current levels or fall to lower levels, this will adversely affect our crude oil operations and our financial condition.\nIn addition, because we are significantly leveraged, a substantial decrease in our revenue due to low commodity prices is currently impairing and may in the future continue to impair our ability to satisfy payment obligations on our indebtedness and reduce funds available for operations and future business opportunities.\nA substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may continue indefinitely, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations, our debt repayment and service obligations, and our financial commitments.\nThe price we receive for our oil and natural gas heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, during the period from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019, the Calendar month average of NYMEX West Texas Intermediate oil prices ranged from a high of $105.15 per Bbl to a low of $30.62 per Bbl. NYMEX Natural Gas settlement prices have ranged from a high of $5.56 per MMBtu to a low of $1.71 per MMBtu during the same period. Additionally, the price differential for natural gas can also vary significantly. Over this same period, monthly prices for NwRox ranged from a high of $5.70 per MMBtu to a low of $1.51 per MMBtu. This near-term volatility may affect future prices in 2020 and beyond. The volatility of the energy markets makes it difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty.\nThe prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d);\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil and natural gas-producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies to discourage use of fuels that emit \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHGs\u201d) and encourage use of alternative energy;\n\u2022\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and natural gas and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe availability of drilling rigs and completion equipment; and\n\u2022\nthe overall economic environment.\nSubstantially all of our production is currently sold at market-based prices. Lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows, borrowing ability and the present value of our reserves. Lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Substantial decreases in oil and natural gas prices could render uneconomic a significant portion of our identified drilling locations, and, may cause us to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or to be unable to claim proved undeveloped reserves at all. If oil and natural gas prices remain at current levels or experience a substantial or extended decline from current levels, our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur reserve estimates may turn out to be incorrect if the assumptions upon which these estimates are based are inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projected future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, drilling, testing and production data acquired subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. Further, the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves and the present value thereof are based upon certain assumptions, including geologic success, the timing and identification of future drilling locations, commodity prices, future production levels, costs and the ability to finance future development that may not prove correct over time. Predictions of future production levels, development schedules (particularly with regard to non-operated properties), participation of joint working interest owners on projects, commodity prices and future operating costs are subject to great uncertainty, and the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based.\nThe present value of net proved reserves included in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the present value, discounted at 10%, of the pre-tax future net cash flows attributable to our net proved reserves on the average oil and natural gas prices during the 12-month period before the ending date of the period covered by this report determined as an un-weighted, arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, adjusted for quality and transportation fees. The costs to produce the reserves remain constant at the costs prevailing on the date of the estimate. Actual current and future commodity prices and costs may be materially higher or lower, and higher future costs and/or lower future commodity prices may impact whether development of our reserves in the future occurs as scheduled or at all. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which the SEC requires us to use in calculating our discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital from time to time and/or the risks associated with our business.\nOur producing properties are located in the Green River Basin in southwest Wyoming, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area.\nAll of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Green River Basin in southwest Wyoming. At December 31, 2019, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we are disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other drought-related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations.\nWe compete with numerous other companies in virtually all facets of our business. Our competitors in development, exploration, acquisitions and production include major integrated oil and natural gas companies as well as numerous independents, including many that have significantly greater resources. Therefore, competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases and evaluate, bid for and purchase a\ngreater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. We also compete for the materials, equipment and services that are necessary for the exploration, development and operation of our properties. Our ability to increase reserves in the future will be dependent on our ability to select and acquire suitable prospects for future exploration and development.\nFactors that affect our ability to compete in the marketplace include:\n\u2022\nour access to the capital necessary to drill and complete wells and acquire properties;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire and analyze seismic, geological and other information relating to a property;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain the personnel necessary to properly evaluate seismic and other information relating to a property;\n\u2022\nour ability to procure materials, equipment and services required to explore, develop and operate our properties;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with administrative, regulatory and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nour ability to access pipelines, and the locations of facilities used to produce and transport oil and natural gas production.\nFactors beyond our control affect our ability to effectively market production and may ultimately affect our financial results.\nThe ability to market oil and natural gas depends on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability of pipeline, rail and refinery capacity, including facilities owned and operated by third parties;\n\u2022\nthe availability of a market for our oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nthe availability of satisfactory transportation arrangements for our oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of natural gas production to natural gas pipelines;\n\u2022\nthe effects of inclement weather;\n\u2022\nthe demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users;\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\nstate and federal regulations of oil and natural gas marketing and transportation; and\n\u2022\nfederal regulation of natural gas sold or transported in interstate commerce.\nBecause of these factors and other factors beyond our control, we may be unable to market all of the oil and natural gas that we produce or obtain favorable prices for such production.\nOur business relies on certain key personnel.\nOur management believes that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of certain of our key personnel. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance on any of our officers or other employees.\nAny derivative transactions we enter into may limit our gains and expose us to other risks such as taxes and royalties.\nWe may enter into financial derivative transactions from time to time to manage our exposure to commodity price risks. These transactions limit our potential gains if commodity prices rise above the levels established by our derivative transactions. These transactions may also expose us to other risks of financial losses, for example, if our production is less than we anticipated at the time we entered into a derivative instrument or if a counterparty to our derivative instruments fails to perform its obligations under a derivatives transaction. We pay royalties and taxes based on physical production; therefore, if we have utilized derivative transactions on a high percentage of our forecast production, we may have royalty and tax burdens that are significantly higher than the derivative price settled for that month\u2019s production.\nLegislation and regulations related to derivative contracts could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) establishes federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives and requires the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) to enact further regulations affecting derivative contracts, including the derivative contracts we use to hedge our exposure to price volatility through the OTC market.\nAlthough the CFTC has issued final regulations in certain areas, final rules in other areas and the scope of relevant definitions and/or exemptions still remain to be finalized. In one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued on November 5, 2013, a proposed rule imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in various commodities (including natural gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain specified types of hedging transactions are exempt from those position limits, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will issue final rules applicable to position limits, depending on the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for the various exemptions available for a commercial end-user using swaps to hedge or mitigate its commercial risks, these rules and regulations may require us to comply with position limits in connection with our financial derivative activities. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s swap regulatory provisions and the related rules of the CFTC on our business will not be known until all of the rules to be adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted and fully implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of future swaps relative to the terms of our existing bilaterally negotiated financial derivative contracts and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against commercial risks we encounter.\nCompliance with environmental and occupational safety and health laws and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact our production.\nOur operations are subject to numerous and complex laws and regulations relating to occupational safety and health aspects of our operations and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations, which are continuously being reviewed for amendment and/or expansion, may:\n\u2022\nrequire that we acquire permits before developing our properties;\n\u2022\nrestrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, completion and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas; and\n\u2022\nrequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, including plugging previously abandoned wells.\nUnder these laws and regulations or under the common law, we could be liable for personal injury and clean-up costs and other environmental, natural resource and property damages, as well as administrative, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could also result in the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects, or the issuance of orders and injunctions limiting or preventing operations relating to our properties in some areas. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of our properties could be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the investigation, removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination. Liability may be imposed regardless of whether the owner or operator was responsible for the release or contamination or whether the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the release or contamination occurred. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which wells are drilled or facilities where petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, to seek damages for contamination or for personal injury or property damage. We maintain limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages, but do not maintain insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by accidental environmental damages. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability in excess of our insurance coverage or may be required to curtail or cease production from properties in the event of material environmental damages.\nWe could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change, engine and other equipment emissions, greenhouse gases and hydraulic fracturing. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and these changes could result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management, or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation or disposal, emission or discharge requirements. Any such changes could require significant expenditures by the Company or other operators of the properties to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, competitive position or financial condition of the Company or such other operators. The oil and natural gas industry faced increased scrutiny as a result of the FY 2017-2019 National Enforcement Initiatives (\u201cNEI\u201d) promulgated by the EPA, through which the EPA purportedly sought to address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health and/or the environment. However, in June 2019, EPA proposed to transition its focus to significant public health and environmental problems without regard to sector, renaming the NEI program and issuing the FY 2020-2023 National Compliance Initiatives, thereby discontinuing the energy extraction activities NEI. Government disruptions, such as an extended federal government shutdown resulting from the failure to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, could delay or halt the granting and renewal of such permits, approvals, and certificates required to conduct our operations.\nA significant percentage of our operations are conducted on federal and state lands. These operations are subject to a wide variety of regulations as well as other permits and authorizations which must be obtained from and issued by state and federal agencies. To conduct these operations, we may be required to file applications for permits, seek agency authorizations and comply with various other statutory and regulatory requirements. Complying with any of these requirements may adversely affect our ability to complete our drilling programs at the costs and in the time periods anticipated.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce.\nMore stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and GHGs may be adopted and could cause us to incur material expenses to comply with such laws and regulations. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA requires the permitting of GHG emissions for certain sources that require permits due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA also requires the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include facilities we operate. Reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. We will continue to incur costs associated with this reporting obligation.\nIn May 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane emissions and VOC from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector; however, in September 2018, under a new administration, the EPA proposed amendments that would relax requirements of the rules. In August 2019, the EPA proposed a significant rollback to the 2016 rule that, if finalized, would rescind the VOC and methane requirements applicable to transmission and storage sources and the methane requirements for production and processing sources, or in the alternative, rescind methane requirements applicable to all oil and natural gas sources. Additionally, in September 2018, the BLM issued a rule that relaxes or rescinds certain requirements of regulations it previously enacted to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands; California and New Mexico have challenged the new rule in ongoing litigation. In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit in federal district court aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is pending (as of October 2019, the EPA had requested a stay of the litigation pending its proposed overhaul of the 2016 methane requirements). Several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the oil and natural gas source category.\nIn addition, the United States Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and many states and regions have already taken legal measures to reduce or measure GHG emission levels, often involving the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to reduce overall GHG emissions. The cost of these allowances could escalate significantly over time. In addition, there are Congressional proposals that could result in significant curtailment of oil and natural gas development and production, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, on BLM lands, where we hold considerable acreage. On an international level, almost 200 nations agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. Although the present administration has announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris accord, several states and local governments remain committed to its principles in their effectuation of policy and regulations. It is not possible at this time to predict if, how or when the United States or states might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the international climate change agreement. The adoption and implementation of any legislation or regulatory programs imposing GHG reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nMoreover, incentives to conserve energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions in product supply chains, or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In addition, parties concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital, restricting or eliminating their investment in or lending to oil and natural gas activities. Finally, growing attention to climate change risks has resulted in increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nPotential physical effects of climate change could adversely affect our operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nMost scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climate events, that could have an adverse effect on our operators\u2019 operations and the production on our properties. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our production activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from powerful winds or floods, or increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process related services provided by midstream companies, service companies, suppliers, or customers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, including with respect to water use and waste disposal, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions; however, the EPA has taken certain actions with respect to regulating hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel fuel in fracturing operations; issued CAA final regulations in 2012 and additional CAA regulations in May 2016 governing performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry, for which the EPA in August 2019 has proposed amendments that would rescind certain requirements of the regulations; issued in June 2016 final effluent limitations guidelines under the CWA that waste water from shale natural gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a publicly-owned treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. However, following years of litigation, the BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017; a lawsuit challenging the rule rescission is pending. The BLM also issued rules in November 2016 which seek to limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands, although the present administration is proposing to delay the implementation dates applicable to the requirements under these rules. The BLM also issued rules in November 2016 to limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands, but subsequently relaxed and rescinded certain requirements of the rules in September 2018; a lawsuit challenging the September 2018 rule revision is pending.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Congress has considered adopting legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Wyoming has adopted regulations requiring producers to provide detailed information about wells they hydraulically fracture in that state. Some states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations requiring disclosure of chemicals in fluids used in hydraulic fracturing or other restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby affect our determination of whether a well is commercially viable. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. We have conducted hydraulic fracturing operations on most of our existing wells, and we anticipate conducting hydraulic fracturing operations on substantially all of our future wells. As a result, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities and adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, hydraulic fracturing operations require the use of a significant amount of water. The inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in drilling and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on the ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the development or production of natural gas.\nFinally, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells for the disposal of waste has been alleged to cause earthquakes. In Oklahoma, for example, such issues have led to orders prohibiting continued injection or the suspension of drilling in certain wells identified as possible sources of seismic activity. Such concerns also have resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells. Although our operations are not located in those jurisdictions, any future orders or regulations addressing concerns about seismic activity from well injection in jurisdictions where we operate could affect our operations.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations, including interpretations thereof, or in our operations may impact our effective tax rate and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTax interpretations, regulations, and legislation in the various jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates operate are subject to measurement uncertainty and the interpretations can impact net income, income tax expense or recovery, and deferred income tax assets or liabilities. In addition, tax rules and regulations, including those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us that may be challenged by the taxation authorities upon audit. In past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such legislative changes have included, but not been limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Although these provisions were largely unchanged in the Tax Act, and the CARES Act, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of future tax reform legislation. Moreover, other more general features of any additional tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted in future legislation and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. Changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate or timing of payments that we are obligated to make, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into U.S. federal law the CARES Act, which is aimed at providing emergency assistance and health care for individuals, families, and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and generally supporting the U.S. economy. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security\npayments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. In particular, under the CARES Act, (i) for taxable years beginning before 2021, net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks may offset 100% of taxable income, (ii) NOLs arising in 2018, 2019, and 2020 taxable years may be carried back to each of the preceding five years to generate a refund and (iii) for taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020, the base for interest deductibility is increased from 30% to 50% of EBITDA. We are analyzing the different aspects of the CARES Act to determine whether any specific provisions may impact us.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, including technologies operated by or under the control of third parties, to conduct certain exploration, development, production and financial activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third-party partners. Unauthorized access to (or the loss of Company access to) our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport our production to market. A cyber-attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.\nWhile our operations and financial condition have not been materially and adversely affected by cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks and resulting losses in the future. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber-attacks.\nOur business and the trading prices of our securities could be negatively impacted by the actions of so-called \u201cactivist\u201d stockholders.\nIf we become the subject of activity by activist shareholders, this could disrupt our business, distract our management and board of directors, and negatively impact our business and the trading prices of our securities, including our common shares. Responding to shareholder activism can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees from our strategic initiatives. Furthermore, activist campaigns can create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy, or leadership and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new employees, investors, customers, and joint venture partners, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\nConcerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash available for distribution.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit in the European, Asian and the U.S. markets contribute to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatile prices of oil, NGL and natural gas, volatility in consumer confidence and job markets, may result in an economic slowdown or recession. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other countries. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which oil, NGL and natural gas from our properties are sold, affect the ability of vendors, suppliers and customers associated with our properties to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash available for distribution.\nIf a sustained financial or economic downturn occurs domestically or internationally, capital market conditions and commodity prices may deteriorate, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and ability to execute our business.\nGlobal and domestic economic conditions are difficult for us to forecast and impossible for us to control. Similarly, conditions in global and domestic capital markets, including debt and equity markets, are difficult for us to forecast and impossible for us to control. Adverse changes, even material adverse changes, in global and domestic economic conditions and in domestic and international capital markets may occur without warning. Although there are steps we can take to anticipate and mitigate such changes, we may fail to do so. If we fail to successfully anticipate or mitigate such matters, adverse changes in global or domestic economic conditions or capital markets, especially materially adverse changes, could increase our costs, limit our financial flexibility, and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOutbreaks of communicable diseases could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, can negatively impact the global economy and, therefore, demand and pricing for oil and natural gas products. For example, there have been recent outbreaks on a global basis, including in the United States, of COVID-19. The outbreak of communicable diseases, or the perception that such an outbreak could occur, could result in a widespread public health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that would negatively impact the demand for oil and natural gas products. Furthermore, uncertainty regarding the impact of any outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, including COVID-19, could lead to increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices. Additionally,\nif a pandemic or epidemic, including COVID-19, were to impact a location where we have a high concentration of our business and resources, the workforce we depend on could be affected by such occurrence, which could also significantly disrupt our results of operations. The duration of such a disruption and the related financial impact from COVID-19 and other such pandemics cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The occurrence or continuation of any of these events could lead to decreased revenues and limit our ability to execute on our business plan, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ability or willingness of OPEC and other oil exporting nations to set and maintain production levels has a significant impact on oil and natural gas commodity prices.\nOPEC is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to manage the price and supply of oil on the global energy market. Actions taken by OPEC members, including those taken alongside other oil exporting nations, have a significant impact on global oil supply and pricing. For example, OPEC and certain other oil exporting nations have previously agreed to take measures, including production cuts, to support crude oil prices. In March 2020, members of OPEC and Russia considered extending and potentially increasing these oil production cuts. However, these negotiations were unsuccessful. As a result, Saudi Arabia announced an immediate reduction in export prices and Russia announced that all previously agreed oil production cuts will expire on April 1, 2020. These actions led to an immediate and steep decrease in oil prices. There can be no assurance that OPEC members and other oil exporting nations will agree to future production cuts or other actions to support and stabilize oil prices, nor can there be any assurance that they will not further reduce oil prices or increase production. Uncertainty regarding future actions to be taken by OPEC members or other oil exporting countries could lead to increased volatility in the price of oil, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we are able to replace reserves that we have produced, our cash flows and production will decrease over time.\nOur future success depends on our ability to find, acquire, develop and produce additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Without successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline. As we assess our business operations in light of our need for liquidity and the current natural gas price environment, we currently have no immediate plans to drill additional wells in our leasehold position in the Green River Basin in southwest Wyoming. This suspension of drilling activity will lead to a decline in our reserves as has been evidenced by our decision to suspend drilling operations in September 2019, due to the low commodity price environment and the expected investment returns in the current commodity price environment. We can give no assurance that we will be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs or at all.\nWe may not be able to replace our reserves or generate cash flows if we are unable to raise capital. We will be required to make substantial capital expenditures to develop our existing reserves and to discover new oil and gas reserves.\nOur ability to resume exploration and development of our properties and to replace reserves depends upon our ability to comply with our debt covenants, renegotiate our debt agreements, raise significant additional financing, or to seek and obtain other arrangements with industry participants in lieu of raising additional financing. Any arrangements that may be entered into could be expensive to us if such arrangements can be made at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital in light of factors such as our financial condition, the market demand for our securities, the general condition of financial markets for independent oil and gas companies (including the markets for debt), oil and natural gas prices and general market conditions. See Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of our capital budget. Continued periods of depressed commodity prices or further commodity price decreases could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to obtain other satisfactory arrangements to allow further exploration and development of our properties if we are unable to raise additional capital.\nWe expect to use our cash from operations, cash from draws on the Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand to fund our capital budget, our operating costs and our interest service obligations during 2020. The loan commitment and the aggregate amount of money that we can borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility and from other sources is revised from time to time based on certain restrictive covenants. A change in our ability to meet the restrictive covenants may limit our ability to borrow. If this occurred, we may have to sell assets or seek substitute financing. We can make no assurances that we would be successful in selling assets or arranging substitute financing. See Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for information about our liquidity, available cash on hand, and the description of the current debt agreements.\nOur operations may be interrupted by severe weather or drilling restrictions.\nOur operations are conducted exclusively in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. The weather in this area can be extreme and can cause interruption in our exploration and production operations. Severe weather can result in damage to our facilities entailing longer operational interruptions and significant capital investment. Likewise, our operations are subject to disruption from winter storms and severe cold, which can limit operations involving fluids and impair access to our facilities.\nWe are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including blowouts, fire, explosion, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations, and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, discharges of toxic gases, underground migration and surface spills or mishandling of fracture fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events with respect to any property we own or operate (in whole or in part) could have a material adverse impact on us. We and the operators of our properties maintain insurance in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be reasonable. However, insurance coverage is not always economically feasible and is not obtained to cover all types of operational risks. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThere are risks associated with our drilling activity that could impact our results of operations.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with drilling, completion, production and transportation of, oil and natural gas. These risks include the necessity of spending large amounts of money for identification and acquisition of properties and for drilling and completion of wells. In the drilling and completing of wells, failures and losses may occur before any deposits of oil or natural gas are found and produced. The presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations, blow-outs or accidents may cause such activity to be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our investment in such activity and possible liabilities. If oil or natural gas is encountered, there can be no assurance that it can be produced in quantities sufficient to justify the cost of continuing such operations or that it can be marketed satisfactorily.\nOur decision to drill a prospect is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all.\nA prospect is an area in which our geoscientists have identified what they believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications of hydrocarbons. Our prospects are in various stages of review. Whether or not we ultimately drill our prospects depends on many factors, including but not limited to: the availability and cost of capital; receipt of additional seismic data or reprocessing of existing data; material changes in current of future expected oil or natural gas prices; the costs and availability of drilling and completion equipment; the success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations or which would use the same production facilities and equipment; changes in the estimates of costs to drill or complete wells; decisions of our joint working interest owners; and regulatory, permitting and other governmental requirements. It is possible these factors and others may cause us to alter our drilling schedule or determine that a prospect should not be pursued at all.\nWe have limited control over activities conducted on properties we do not operate.\nWe own interests in properties that are operated by third parties. The success, timing and costs of drilling, completion, and other development activities on our non-operated properties depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control. Because we have only a limited ability to influence and control the operations of our non-operated properties, we can give no assurances that we will realize our targeted returns with respect to those properties.\nOur business depends on gathering and transportation facilities owned by others. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production will depend in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems owned by third parties. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity, or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may fail to fully identify problems with any properties we acquire.\nWe acquired a portion of our acreage position through property acquisitions and acreage trades, and we may acquire additional acreage in these or other regions in the future. Although we conduct a review of properties we acquire which we believe is consistent with industry practices, we can give no assurance that we have identified or will identify all existing or potential problems associated with such properties or that we will be able to mitigate any problems we do identify.\nOur acquisitions may perform worse than we expected or prove to be worth less than what we paid because of uncertain factors and matters beyond our control. In addition, our acquisitions could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.\nWhen we make acquisitions of oil and gas properties, we make assumptions about many uncertain factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, expected timing of recovering acquired reserves, future commodity prices, expected development and operating costs,\nand other matters, many of which are beyond our control. Assumptions about uncertain factors may be wrong, and the properties we acquire may perform worse than we expect, materially and adversely affecting our operations and financial condition.\nConservation measures and improvements in or new discoveries of alternative technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSince our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any fuel conservation measures, improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy, transportation, or materials technologies and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and alternative feedstocks, and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations.\nAny future implementation of price controls on oil and natural gas would affect our operations.\nThe United States Congress may in the future impose some form of price controls on either oil, natural gas, or both. Any future limits on the price of oil or natural gas could negatively affect the demand for our services and consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA negative shift in investor sentiment of the oil and gas industry could adversely affect our ability to raise debt and equity capital.\nCertain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas and related infrastructure projects.\nSuch developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, impacting our future financial results.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, seismic activity, climate change, explosions of natural gas transmission lines and the development and operation of pipelines and other midstream facilities may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. Additionally, environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates may oppose our operations through organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations or those of our midstream transportation providers, intervene in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets or those of our midstream transportation providers, or file lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our assets and business or those of our midstream transportation providers. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention towards sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in energy-related activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities.\nA low ESG or sustainability score could result in the exclusion of our common shares from consideration by certain investment funds and a negative perception of us by certain investors.\nCertain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) or \u201csustainability\u201d metrics. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. Many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG disclosure or performance. Moreover, certain members of the broader investment community may consider a company\u2019s sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of the Company\u2019s common shares from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of the Company by certain investors.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nOur reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with employees, investors, customers, suppliers and joint venture partners. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, we could significantly harm our reputation. Our reputation may also be damaged by how we respond to corporate crises. Corporate crises can arise from catastrophic events as well as from incidents involving unethical behavior or misconduct; allegations of legal noncompliance; internal control failures; corporate governance issues; data breaches; workplace safety incidents; environmental incidents; media statements; the conduct of our suppliers or representatives; and other issues or incidents that, whether actual or perceived, result in adverse publicity. If we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address such crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions.\nDamage to our reputation could negatively affect the demand for our services and consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It could also reduce investor confidence in us, adversely affecting our stock price. Moreover, repairing our reputation may be difficult, time-consuming and expensive.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are currently a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset- backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a non-affiliated public float of less than $250 million or annual revenues of less than $100 million and public float of less than $700 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. At such time as we cease being a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we will be required to provide additional disclosure in our SEC filings. \u201cSmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified disclosures in their filings, including with respect to, among other things, executive compensation and financial statement information and are also exempt from certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
