{"cik": "1420800", "company": "Colfax CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but may not be the only risks to which Colfax might be exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties, which are currently unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to be material, may materially affect the business of Colfax and could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected, the value of our Common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of the value of their investment in Colfax shares.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nAcquisitions have formed a significant part of our growth strategy in the past and are expected to continue to do so. If we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete any proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate the businesses we acquire, our growth strategy may not succeed and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.\nWe intend to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in our existing markets. However, our ability to do so will depend on a number of steps, including our ability to: obtain debt or equity financing that we may need to complete proposed acquisitions; identify suitable acquisition candidates; negotiate appropriate acquisition terms; complete the proposed acquisitions; and integrate the acquired business into our existing operations. If we fail to achieve any of these steps, our growth strategy may not be successful.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, systems, controls, technologies, personnel, services and products of the acquired company, the potential loss of key employees, customers, suppliers and distributors of the acquired company, and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. The failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses in a timely manner, or at all, or the incurrence of significant unanticipated expenses associated with integration activities, including information technology integration fees, legal compliance costs, facility closure costs and other restructuring expenses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than we expect. Actual operating, technological, strategic and sales synergies, if achieved at all, may be less significant than we expect or may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If we are not able to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from our acquisitions within a reasonable time, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we may underestimate or fail to discover liabilities relating to acquisitions during our due diligence investigations, and we, as the successor owner of an acquired company, might be responsible for those liabilities. Such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may require additional capital to finance our operating needs and to finance our growth, including acquisitions. If the terms on which the additional capital is available are unsatisfactory, if the additional capital is not available at all or if we are not able to fully access credit under our credit agreement, we may not be able to pursue our growth strategy.\nOur growth strategy will require additional capital investment to complete acquisitions, integrate the completed acquisitions into our existing operations and expand into new markets. We intend to pay for future acquisitions using cash, capital stock, notes, assumption of indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing. To the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash internally to provide the capital we require to fund our growth strategy and future operations, we will require additional debt or equity financing. This additional financing may not be available or, if available, may not be on terms acceptable to us. Further, high volatility in the capital markets and in our stock price may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets at attractive prices, if at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future, it may limit our ability to fully implement our growth strategy. Even if future debt financing is available, it may result in (i) increased interest expense, (ii) increased term loan payments, (iii) increased leverage and (iv) decreased income available to fund further acquisitions and expansion. It may also limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns. If future equity financing is available, issuances of our equity securities may significantly dilute our existing stockholders.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nWe have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness. We are also party to letter of credit facilities with total capacity of $340.5 million, of which $76.4 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nOur debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; increasing our leverage and reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions; making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates.\nAdditionally, the credit agreement governing our term loan and revolving credit facilities (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) and the indentures governing our notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; make certain investments; create liens on certain assets to secure debt; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all our assets; and refinance our indebtedness.\nIn addition, under the Credit Facility we are required to satisfy and maintain compliance with a total leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. Limitations imposed by the various covenants contained in the Credit Facility or in the indentures governing our notes could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we may incur or assume more debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our existing debt agreements, and if we do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may face substantial liquidity problems and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, including material assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful or yield adequate proceeds and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Credit Facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds of dispositions and the Credit Facility and the indentures governing our notes restrict our ability to refinance our indebtedness. In addition, any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers and suppliers operate, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations, financial condition, and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis, and the resulting impact on governments, businesses and individuals and actions taken by them in response to the situation have resulted in widespread economic disruptions, significantly affecting broader economies, financial markets, and overall demand for our products. It is uncertain when and to what extent these conditions will subside and whether and how quickly businesses will return to levels that existed before the outbreak of the pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions that severely impact and may continue to severely impact our businesses including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Material delays and cancellations of elective medical procedures; orthopedic clinics and physical therapy centers operating at reduced capacity and only serving critical patients; and cancellation of professional, college, high school and youth sports programs impacting our Medical Technology business; and\n\u2022Reductions in levels of new capital investment and maintenance expenditures or a sustained industrial downturn impacting our Fabrication Technology business.\nAs a result of such impacts, we experienced significant decreases in sales at each of our Medical Technology and Fabrication Technology businesses in 2020 and expect pressures to continue into at least the first quarter of 2021 and possibly beyond. To the extent there is a resurgence of COVID-19 or restrictions are reinstated, our businesses could be further negatively impacted. Ultimately, we expect that the longer the period of economic disruption and sharper the declines in customer demand, the more material the adverse impact will be on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a prolonged period of generating lower cash from operations could adversely affect our financial condition and the achievement of our strategic objectives. Conditions in the financial and credit markets may also limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe degree to which the COVID-19 situation continues to impact our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including the duration and magnitude of such impacts, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, including any resurgences, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the availability and public acceptance of approved vaccines and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. Even to the extent conditions begin to improve, the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts and/or the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and line of business. Additionally, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions by governments, businesses and individuals in response, could give rise or contribute to or amplify many of the risks discussed in our other risk factors, included in this Part 1, Item A of this Form 10-K.\nA continued significant or sustained decline in the levels of new capital investment and maintenance expenditures by certain of our customers could reduce the demand for our fabrication technology products and services and harm our operations and financial performance.\nDemand for our fabrication technology products and services depends significantly on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by certain of our customers. The level of new capital expenditures by our fabrication technology customers is dependent upon many factors, including general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions and investment activities within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. In addition, volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these new activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. A reduction in demand for our fabrication technology products and services has resulted in the past, and in the future could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. For example, in 2020, we experienced a decline in customer demand for our fabrication technology products and services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur restructuring activities may subject us to additional uncertainty in our operating results.\nWe have implemented, and plan to continue to implement, restructuring programs designed to facilitate key strategic initiatives and maintain long-term sustainable growth. As such, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses relating to restructuring activities. We may not achieve or sustain the anticipated benefits, including any anticipated savings, of these restructuring programs or initiatives. Further, restructuring efforts are inherently risky, and we may not be able to predict the cost and timing of such actions accurately or properly estimate their impact.\nAny impairment in the value of our intangible assets, including Goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization.\nOur Total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily Goodwill. The Goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired. As a result of our acquisition of DJO, the amount of Goodwill on our consolidated financial statements increased. We assess at least annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions for\nan acquired business decline, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for Goodwill impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.\nCertain of our businesses, particularly our Medical Technology business, subject us to the possibility of product liability lawsuits, which could harm our business.\nOur Medical Technology business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Additionally, as the manufacturer of equipment for use in industrial markets, we may be subject to product liability claims. Component failures, manufacturing nonconformances, design defects, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our products could result in unsafe conditions, injury or death. In addition, some of our products contain components manufactured by third parties, which may also have defects. From time to time, DJO has historically been, and is currently, subject to a number of product liability claims alleging that the use of its products resulted in adverse effects. Our product liability insurance policies have limits that may not be sufficient to cover claims made. In addition, this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost. With respect to components manufactured by third-party suppliers, the contractual indemnification that we seek from our third-party suppliers may be limited and thus insufficient to cover claims made against us. If insurance coverage or contractual indemnification is insufficient to satisfy product liability claims made against us, the claims could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Even claims without merit could harm our reputation, reduce demand for our products, cause us to incur substantial legal costs and distract the attention of our management. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to certain of our medical device products, the Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) and certain foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products under certain circumstances. Accordingly, a government mandated recall or a voluntary recall initiated by us could occur as a result of actual or potential component failures, manufacturing errors, or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall would divert managerial and financial resources and could harm our reputation with customers and with the healthcare professionals that use, prescribe and recommend our products and result in significant costs. Correcting product deficiencies and defects may also require submission of additional marketing authorizations before we may continue marketing the corrected device.\nOur information technology infrastructure could be subject to service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, which could result in the disruption of operations or the loss of data confidentiality.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, cloud-based services and third-party service providers, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d), personally identifiable information, credit card and other financial information), and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, collection, communication with our employees, customers, dealers and suppliers, business acquisitions and other corporate transactions, compliance with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, and research and development. For example, in the ordinary course of business, our Medical Technology segment collects, stores, and transmits certain sensitive data, including PHI, personally identifiable information, and patient data. These information technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components, power outages, hardware failures or computer viruses. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, our information technology networks and systems are subject to security threats and sophisticated cyber-based attacks, including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, or physical breaches, that can cause deliberate or unintentional damage, destruction or misuse, manipulation, denial of access to or disclosure of confidential or important information by our employees, suppliers or third-party service providers. Additionally, advanced persistent attempts to gain unauthorized access or deny access to, or otherwise disrupt, our systems and those of third-party service providers we rely on are increasing in sophistication and frequency. We have experienced, and expect to continue to confront, efforts by hackers and other third parties to gain unauthorized access or deny access to, or otherwise disrupt, our information technology systems and networks. Any such future attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We can provide no assurance that our efforts to actively manage technology risks potentially\naffecting our systems and networks will be successful in eliminating or mitigating risks to our systems, networks and data or in effectively resolving such risks when they materialize. A failure of or breach in information technology security of our own systems, or those of our third-party vendors, could expose us and our employees, customers, dealers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. Any of these events in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, including loss of customers and revenue, business, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, including liability under federal or state laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPAA or HITECH, as well as the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nAdditionally, to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, some of the data we handle and aspects of our operations are subject to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and provides for significant potential penalties and remedies for violations. Other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nA material disruption at any of our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.\nIf operations at any of our manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of a significant equipment failure, natural disaster, power outage, fire, explosion, terrorism, cyber-based attack, health epidemic or pandemic or other contagious outbreak, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, labor dispute or other reason, our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result of our inability to meet customer demand for our products.\nInterruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales. Any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation or rely on third-party manufacturers, which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. Any recovery under our property damage and business interruption insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our sales are derived from international operations. We are subject to specific risks associated with international operations.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 58% of our sales from operations outside of the United States and we have principal manufacturing facilities in 16 countries in addition to the United States. Sales from international operations, export sales and the use of manufacturing facilities outside of the United States by us are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the United States. These risks include: economic or political instability; partial or total expropriation of international assets; limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises; trade protection measures by the United States or other nations including China, including tariffs or import-export restrictions or licensing requirements, and other changes in trade relations; currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation; labor and employment laws that may be more restrictive than in the United States; changes in laws and regulations, including taxation policies, or in how such provisions are interpreted or administered; difficulties in enforcing our rights outside the United States, including intellectual property rights; difficulties in hiring and maintaining qualified staff and managing geographically diverse operations; the disruption of operations from natural disasters, world health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, labor or political disturbances, terrorist activities, insurrection or war; the imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations on the sale of our products; increased costs of transportation or shipping; the transition away from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a benchmark reference for short-term interests; and uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize, they may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, changes in U.S. policy regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could also negatively impact our business. In 2018, the United States imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in\nretaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and its full effects are still uncertain and will depend on among other things, the financial, trade, regulatory, and legal implications of the trade and cooperation agreement the United Kingdom and the European Union enter into and any future agreements. This uncertainty regarding the economic outlook of the United Kingdom has caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in foreign exchange rates, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth in future periods. Any trade barriers resulting from the exit may disrupt distribution channels, increase our Cost of sales, and limit our ability to achieve future product margin growth. We may also face new regulatory costs, employee retention, and other challenges that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we implement policies, procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies, which could result in civil or criminal enforcement actions and penalties, create a substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market.\nIf our associates represented by trade unions or works councils engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown or if the representation committees responsible for negotiating with such trade unions or works councils are unsuccessful in negotiating new and acceptable agreements when the existing agreements with associates covered by collective bargaining expire, we could experience business disruptions or increased costs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 50% of our associates were represented by a number of different trade unions and works councils. Further, as of that date, we had approximately 12,300 associates, representing 80% of our worldwide associate base, in foreign locations. In Canada, Australia and various countries in Europe, Asia, and Central and South America, by law, certain of our associates are represented by a number of different trade unions and works councils, which subject us to employment arrangements very similar to collective bargaining agreements. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries may place restrictions on our ability to take certain employee-related actions or require that we conduct additional negotiations with trade unions, works councils or other governmental authorities before we can take such actions.\nIf our associates represented by trade unions or works councils were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. Such disruption could interfere with our business operations and could lead to decreased productivity, increased labor costs and lost revenue. The representation committees that negotiate with the foreign trade unions or works councils on our behalf may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or other employment arrangements when the current ones expire. Furthermore, future labor negotiations could result in significant increases in our labor costs. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights or challenges to these rights by third parties may affect our operations and financial performance.\nThe market for many of our products, including our medical device products, is, in part, dependent upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, agreements with employees, customers and other third parties, including confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements and proprietary information agreements, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights, and the Goodwill engendered by our trademarks and trade names. The protection and enforcement of these intellectual property rights is therefore material to our business. The failure to protect these rights may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. It may be particularly difficult to enforce our intellectual property rights in countries where such rights are not highly developed or protected. Any action we take to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights.\nIn addition, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in the medical technology industry. Any claims of intellectual property infringement may subject us to costly and\ntime-consuming defense actions and, should our defenses not be successful, may result in the payment of damages, redesign of affected products, entry into settlement or license agreements, or a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products. It is also possible that others will independently develop technology that will compete with our patented or unpatented technology. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical and death benefit plans are or may become subject to funding requirements or obligations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical and death benefit plans for current and former employees worldwide. Each plan\u2019s funding position is affected by the investment performance of the plan\u2019s investments, changes in the fair value of the plan\u2019s assets, the type of investments, the life expectancy of the plan\u2019s members, changes in the actuarial assumptions used to value the plan\u2019s liabilities, changes in the rate of inflation and interest rates, our financial position, as well as other changes in economic conditions. Furthermore, since a significant proportion of the plans\u2019 assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities, they are, and will be, affected by market risks. Any detrimental change in any of the above factors is likely to worsen the funding position of each of the relevant plans, and this would likely require the plans\u2019 sponsoring employers to increase the contributions currently made to the plans to satisfy our obligations. Any requirement to increase the level of contributions currently made could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 58% of our sales were derived from operations outside the United States. A significant portion of our revenues and income are denominated in foreign currencies. Large fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the currency exchange rates may impact our financial results positively or negatively in one period and not another, which may make it difficult to compare our operating results from different periods. For example, during 2018, Argentina became a highly inflationary economy, resulting in the remeasurement of our Argentinian operations. Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Argentina on our Consolidated Financial Statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates.\nWe also face exchange risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Although we use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for reporting purposes, we have manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred and sales are generated in foreign currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. Further, we may be subject to foreign currency translation losses depending upon whether foreign nations devalue their currencies.\nWe are dependent on the availability of raw materials, as well as parts and components used in our products.\nWhile we manufacture many of the parts and components used in our products, we purchase a substantial amount of raw materials, parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels, trade disputes and increased tariffs. Additionally, FDA regulations may require additional testing of any raw materials or components from new suppliers prior to the use of those materials or components in certain medical device products. In addition, in the case of a device which is the subject of a pre-market approval, we may also be required to obtain prior FDA permission (which may or may not be given), which could delay or prevent access or use of such raw materials or components. Any significant change in the supply of, or price for, these raw materials, parts or components could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, delays in the delivery of raw materials, parts or components by suppliers could cause delays in our delivery of products to our customers.\nCertain of our products use components obtained from single sources. For example, the microprocessor used in our OL1000 and SpinaLogic devices is from a single manufacturer. Establishment of additional or replacement suppliers for these components cannot be accomplished quickly and the loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a\nsingle-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we rely on third parties to manufacture some of our medical device products. For example, we use a single source for many of the consumer devices our Medical Technology segment distributes in one country. If our agreements with these manufacturing companies were terminated, we may not be able to find suitable replacements within a reasonable amount of time or at all. Any such cessation, interruption or delay may impair our ability to meet scheduled deliveries of our products to our customers and may cause our customers to cancel orders.\nAdditionally, political and economic instability and changes in government regulations in China and other parts of Asia or any health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect our ability to continue to receive materials from suppliers there. The loss of suppliers in these areas, any other interruption or delay in the supply of required materials or our inability to obtain these materials at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time could impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could hurt our reputation and cause customers to cancel orders.\nThe markets we serve are highly competitive and some of our competitors may have superior resources. If we are unable to respond successfully to this competition, this could reduce our sales and operating margins.\nOur businesses operate in highly fragmented and competitive markets. In order to maintain and enhance our competitive position, we intend to, among other things, continue investing in manufacturing quality, marketing, customer service and support, distribution networks, and research and development. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments and we may not be able to maintain our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or more widely accepted, develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services, adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or have a larger product portfolio. Some of our competitors may also have greater financial, marketing and research and development resources than we have or stronger name recognition. As a result, those competitors may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. In addition, pricing pressures could cause us to lower the prices of some of our products to stay competitive. The development of new technologies by competitors that may compete with our technologies could reduce demand for our products and affect our financial performance. For example, our present and future medical device products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies. Should we not be able to maintain or enhance the competitive values of our products or develop and introduce new products or technologies successfully, or if new products or technologies fail to generate sufficient revenues to offset research and development costs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our medical device products depends heavily on acceptance by healthcare professionals who prescribe and recommend these products, and our failure to maintain relationships with key healthcare professionals or maintain a high level of confidence by key healthcare professionals in our products could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. If we fail to compete successfully, the failure may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please see Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Industry and Competition\u201d for additional information about the competitive markets in which we operate.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur future effective income tax rates could be unfavorably affected by various factors, including, among others, changes in the tax rates, rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we generate income. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. Moreover, the recent change in the U.S. presidential administration may increase the likelihood of changes to U.S. federal income tax law. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country\u2019s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution. For example, an outgrowth of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) original Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project is an ongoing project undertaken by the 139 member countries of the expanded OECD Inclusive Framework focused on \u201cAddressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy,\u201d which may impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights with Pillar One and Pillar Two blueprints. As these and other tax laws, regulations and norms change or evolve, our financial results could\nbe materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, our future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.\nRisk Related to Our Medical Technology Business\nIf coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors for our medical device products are not obtained, healthcare providers and patients may be reluctant to use our medical device products, our margins may suffer and revenue and profits may decline.\nThe sales of our medical device products depend largely on whether there is coverage and adequate reimbursement by government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and by private payors. Surgeons, hospitals, physical therapists and other healthcare providers may not use, purchase or prescribe our products and patients may not purchase these products if these third-party payors do not provide satisfactory coverage of and reimbursement for the costs of our medical device products or the procedures involving the use of such products. Reduced reimbursement rates will also lower our margins on product sales and could adversely impact the profitability and viability of the affected products.\nThird-party payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully and can, without notice, reduce or eliminate reimbursement for our medical device products or treatments that use these products. For instance, they may attempt to control costs by (i) authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures, including joint reconstructive surgeries, (ii) requiring the use of the least expensive product available, (iii) reducing the reimbursement for or limiting the number of authorized visits for rehabilitation procedures, (iv) bundling reimbursement for all services related to an episode of care, or (v) otherwise restricting coverage or reimbursement of our medical device products or procedures using these products.\nMedicare payment for Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (\u201cDMEPOS\u201d) also can be impacted by the DMEPOS competitive bidding program, under which Medicare rates are based on bid amounts for certain products in designated geographic areas, rather than the Medicare fee schedule amount. Only those suppliers selected through the competitive bidding process within each designated competitive bidding area (\u201cCBA\u201d) are eligible to have their products reimbursed by Medicare. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) also has adopted regulations to adjust national DMEPOS fee schedules to take into account competitive bidding pricing. If any of our medical device products are included in competitive bidding and we are not selected as a contract supplier (or subcontractor) in a particular region, or if contract or fee schedule prices are significantly below current Medicare fee schedule reimbursement levels, it could have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability.\nBecause many private payors model their coverage and reimbursement policies on Medicare, other third-party payors\u2019 coverage of, and reimbursement for, our medical device products also could be negatively impacted by legislative, regulatory or other measures that restrict Medicare coverage or reduce Medicare reimbursement.\nInternational sales of medical device products also depend in part upon the coverage and eligibility for reimbursement of our products through government-sponsored healthcare payment systems and third-party payors, the amount of reimbursement, and the cost allocation of payments between the patient and government-sponsored healthcare payment systems and third-party payors. Coverage and reimbursement practices vary significantly by country, with certain countries requiring products to undergo a lengthy regulatory review in order to be eligible for third-party coverage and reimbursement. In addition, healthcare cost containment efforts similar to those we face in the United States are prevalent in many of the foreign countries in which our products are sold, and these efforts are expected to continue in the future, possibly resulting in the adoption of more stringent reimbursement standards relating to our international operations.\nAdditionally, federal and state legislatures and regulators have periodically considered proposals to limit the types of orthopedic professionals who can fit or sell our orthotic products or who can seek reimbursement for them. Several states have adopted legislation imposing certification or licensing requirements on the measuring, fitting and adjusting of certain orthotic devices, and additional states may do so in the future. Although some of these state laws exempt manufacturers\u2019 representatives, others do not. Such laws could reduce the number of potential customers by restricting our sales representatives\u2019 activities in those jurisdictions or reduce demand for our products by reducing the number of professionals who fit and sell them. In\naddition, legislation has been adopted, but not implemented to date, requiring that certain certification or licensing requirements be met for individuals and suppliers furnishing certain custom-fabricated orthotic devices as a condition of Medicare payment. Medicare currently follows state policies in those states that require the use of an orthotist or prosthetist for furnishing of orthotics or prosthetics.\nFederal and state health reform and cost control efforts include provisions that could adversely impact our business and results of operations, and federal and state legislatures continue to consider further reforms and cost control efforts that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) was enacted in the United States. The ACA is a sweeping measure designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control health care spending, and improve health care quality. Several provisions of the ACA specifically affect the medical equipment industry. The ACA also implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. The ACA also established enhanced Medicare and Medicaid program integrity provisions, including expanded documentation requirements for Medicare DMEPOS orders, more stringent procedures for screening Medicare and Medicaid DMEPOS suppliers, and new disclosure requirements regarding manufacturer payments to physicians and teaching hospitals, along with broader expansion of federal fraud and abuse authorities. The ACA also established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to providers by 2% per fiscal year, effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d) enacted on April 16, 2015, repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that became effective in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians\u2019 participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations. It is unclear what effect new quality and payment programs, such as MACRA, may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Likewise, most states have adopted or are considering policies to reduce Medicaid spending as a result of state budgetary shortfalls, which in some cases include reduced reimbursement for DMEPOS items and/or other Medicaid coverage restrictions.\nFederal policy may also impact state Medicaid policy. For instance, effective January 1, 2018, the 21st Century Cures Act prohibits federal financial participation payments to states for certain Medicaid DME spending that exceeds what Medicare would have paid for such items. Any modification or repeal of any provisions of the ACA may require states to modify their own laws and regulations. As states continue to face significant financial pressures, it is possible that state health policy changes will adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation relating to the safety, efficacy, testing, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of our medical device products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulation,\u201d our medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur contract manufacturers and component suppliers are also required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation. We cannot assure you that our contract manufacturers\u2019 or component suppliers\u2019 facilities would pass any future quality system inspection. If we or any of our contract manufacturers\u2019 or component suppliers\u2019 facilities fail a quality system inspection, our product sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to\nsignificant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\nWith respect to our operations in the EU, we have incurred and will need to incur additional costs to comply, which may be significant. If we fail to meet the requirements of the MDR, or are delayed in doing so, it could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements. Additionally, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices from the United States to foreign countries and certain foreign countries may require FDA certification that our medical device products are in compliance with U.S. law. Failure to obtain or maintain export certificates required for the export of our products could materially adversely impact revenues and growth.\nThe success of our surgical implant products depends on our relationships with leading surgeons who assist with the development and testing of our products, and our ability to comply with enhanced disclosure requirements regarding payments to physicians.\nA key aspect of the development and sale of our surgical implant products is the use of designing and consulting arrangements with orthopedic surgeons who are highly qualified and experienced in their field. These surgeons assist in the development and clinical testing of new surgical implant products. They also participate in symposia and seminars introducing new surgical implant products and assist in the training of healthcare professionals in using our new products. We may not be successful in maintaining or renewing our current designing and consulting arrangements with these surgeons or in developing similar arrangements with new surgeons. In that event, our ability to develop, test and market new surgical implant products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act which requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually certain information related to payments or other transfers of value made to licensed physicians, certain other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and related state marketing and payment disclosure requirements and industry guidelines could have an adverse impact on our relationships with surgeons, and we cannot assure you that such requirements and guidelines would not impose additional costs on us or adversely impact our consulting and other arrangements with surgeons.\nWe rely on a variety of distribution methods to market and sell our medical device products and if we fail to effectively manage the distribution of such products, our results of operations and future growth could be adversely impacted.\nWe use a variety of distribution methods to market and sell our medical device products, each of which has distinct risks. For example, to market and sell certain of the orthopedic rehabilitation products which are intended for use in the home and in rehabilitation clinics, we rely on our own direct sales force of representatives in the United States and in Europe. A direct sales force may subject us to higher fixed costs than those of companies that market competing products through independent third parties due to the costs associated with employee benefits, training, and managing sales personnel. As a result, we could be at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain competitors that rely predominately on independent sales agents and third-party distributors. Additionally, these fixed costs may slow our ability to reduce costs in the face of a sudden decline in demand for such products, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. However, for certain orthopedic products, CMF products and surgical implant products, we rely on third-party distributors and independent commissioned sales representatives that maintain the customer relationships with the hospitals, orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists and other healthcare professionals that purchase, use and recommend the use of such products. Although our internal sales staff trains and manages these third-party distributors and independent sales representatives, we do not directly monitor the efforts that they make to sell our products. In addition, some of the independent sales representatives that we use to sell our surgical implant products also sell products that directly compete with our product offerings. These sales representatives may not dedicate the necessary time or effort to market and sell our products. If we fail to attract and maintain relationships with third-party distributors and skilled independent sales representatives or fail to adequately train and monitor the efforts of the third-party distributors and sales representatives that market and sell our products, or if our existing third-party distributors and independent sales representatives choose not to carry our products, our results of operations and future growth could be adversely affected.\nAudits or denials of claims by government agencies could reduce our revenues or profits.\nAs part of our Medical Technology business, we submit claims on behalf of patients directly to, and receive payments directly from, the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors. Therefore, we are subject to extensive government\nregulation, including detailed requirements for submitting reimbursement claims under appropriate codes and maintaining certain documentation to support our claims. Medicare contractors and Medicaid agencies periodically conduct pre- and post-payment reviews and other audits of claims and are under increasing pressure to more closely scrutinize healthcare claims and supporting documentation. Historically, DJO was subject to pre-payment and post-payment reviews as well as audits of claims and we may experience such reviews and audits of claims in the future. Such reviews or similar audits of our claims including by RACs (private companies operating on a contingent fee basis to identify and recoup Medicare overpayments) and ZPICs (contractors charged with investigating potential fraud and abuse) could result in material delays in payment, as well as material recoupment or denials, which would reduce our net sales and profitability, investigations, potential liability under fraud or abuse laws or exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. Private payors may from time to time conduct similar reviews and audits.\nAdditionally, we participate in the government\u2019s Federal Supply Schedule program for medical equipment, whereby we contract with the government to supply certain of our medical products. Participation in this program requires us to follow certain pricing practices and other contract requirements. Failure to comply with such pricing practices and/or other contract requirements could result in delays in payment or fines or penalties, which could reduce our revenues or profits.\nIf we fail to comply with broad based healthcare and other governmental regulations, we could face substantial fines and penalties and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs described in Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Regulation,\u201d our Medical Technology business is subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs, and any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Additionally, if there is a change in law, regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change one or more of our business practices to be in compliance with these laws. Required changes could be costly and time consuming and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nManaged care and buying groups have put downward pressure on the prices of medical device products.\nThe growth of managed care and the advent of buying groups in the United States have caused a shift toward coverage and payments based on more cost-effective treatment alternatives. Buying groups enter into preferred supplier arrangements with one or more manufacturers of medical products in return for price discounts to members of these buying groups. Our failure to obtain new preferred supplier commitments from major group purchasing organizations or our failure to retain our existing preferred supplier commitments could adversely affect our sales and profitability. In international markets where we sell our medical device products, there has been similar downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare cost control efforts. We expect a continued emphasis on healthcare cost controls, alternate payment models such as bundled payments, and managed care in the United States and in these international markets, which could put further downward pressure on product pricing, which, in turn may adversely affect our sales and profitability\nRisks Related to Litigation and Regulatory Compliance\nAvailable insurance coverage, the number of future asbestos-related claims and the average settlement value of current and future asbestos-related claims of certain subsidiaries could be different than we have estimated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos. Such components were acquired from third-party suppliers and were not manufactured by any of our subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos. Additionally, pursuant to the definitive purchase agreements related to the sale of our Fluid Handling and Howden businesses, we have retained the asbestos-related contingencies and insurance coverage related to these businesses, even though we do not retain an interest in the ongoing operations of the Fluid Handling or Howden businesses.\nFor the purposes of our financial statements, we have estimated the future claims exposure and the amount of insurance available based upon certain assumptions with respect to future claims and liability costs. We estimate the liability\ncosts to be incurred in resolving pending and forecasted claims for the next 15-year period as well as the amount of insurance proceeds available for such claims. We reevaluate these estimates regularly. Although we believe our current estimates are reasonable, a change in the time period used for forecasting our liability costs, the actual number of future claims brought against us, the cost of resolving these claims, the likelihood of payment by, and the solvency of, insurers and the amount of remaining insurance available could be substantially different than our estimates, and future revaluation of our liabilities and insurance recoveries could result in material adjustments to these estimates, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we incur defense costs related to those claims, a portion of which has historically been reimbursed by our insurers. We also incur litigation costs in connection with actions against certain of the subsidiaries\u2019 insurers relating to insurance coverage. These costs may be significant, and we may not be able to predict the amount or duration of such costs. Additionally, we may experience delays in receiving reimbursement from insurers, during which time we may be required to pay cash for settlement or legal defense costs. Any increase in the actual number of future claims brought against us, the defense costs of resolving these claims, the costs of pursuing claims against our insurers, the likelihood and timing of payment by, and the solvency of, insurers and the amount of remaining insurance available, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have done and may continue to do business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions and embargoes, and we may have limited managerial oversight over those activities. Failure to comply with various sanction and embargo laws may result in enforcement or other regulatory actions.\nCertain of our independent foreign subsidiaries have conducted and may continue to conduct business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions and embargoes or may engage in business dealings with parties whose property or property interests may be blocked under non-country-specific U.S. sanctions programs, and we have limited managerial oversight over those activities. Failure to comply properly with various sanction and embargo laws to which we and our operations may be subject may result in enforcement or other regulatory actions. Specifically, from time to time, certain of our independent foreign subsidiaries sell products to companies and entities located in, or controlled by the governments of, certain countries that are or have previously been subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government, the United Nations or other countries where we maintain operations. With the exception of the U.S. sanctions against Cuba and Iran, the applicable sanctions and embargoes generally do not prohibit our foreign subsidiaries from selling non-U.S.-origin products and services to countries that are or have previously been subject to sanctions and embargoes. However, our U.S. personnel, each of our domestic subsidiaries, as well as our employees of foreign subsidiaries who are U.S. citizens, are prohibited from participating in, approving or otherwise facilitating any aspect of the business activities in those countries or with persons prohibited under U.S. sanctions. These constraints impose compliance costs and risks on our operations and may negatively affect the financial or operating performance of such business activities.\nOur efforts to comply with U.S. and other applicable sanction and embargo laws may not be effective, and as a consequence we may face enforcement or other actions if our compliance efforts are not or are perceived as not being wholly effective. Actual or alleged violations of these laws could lead to substantial fines or other sanctions which could result in substantial costs. In addition, Syria, Sudan and Iran and certain other sanctioned countries currently are identified by the U.S. State Department as state sponsors of terrorism, and have been subject to restrictive sanctions. Because certain of our independent foreign subsidiaries have contact with and transact limited business in certain U.S. sanctioned countries, including sales to enterprises controlled by agencies of the governments of such countries, our reputation may suffer due to our association with these countries, which may have a material adverse effect on the price of our Common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain U.S. states and municipalities have enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as state sponsors of terrorism and similar legislation may be pending in other states. As a result, pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as Colfax or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may have a material adverse effect on the price of our Common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with export control regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our products manufactured or assembled in the United States are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which require that an export license is obtained before such products can be exported to certain countries, and the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of\nForeign Assets Control\u2019s trade and economic sanctions programs. Additionally, some of our products are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which restrict the export of certain military or intelligence-related items, technologies and services to non-U.S. persons. Such regulations may prohibit or restrict our ability to, directly or indirectly, conduct activities or dealings in or with certain countries or territories that are the subject of comprehensive embargoes, as well as with certain individuals or entities. Failure to comply with these laws could harm our business by subjecting us to sanctions by the U.S. government, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges and debarment from U.S. government contracts. For example, from 2016 through 2020, one of our foreign subsidiaries engaged in certain transactions, a limited number of which included U.S. origin goods, either directly or indirectly through distributors, involving sales to specially designated nationals and/or to the Crimea region of Ukraine, which may have been made in violation of relevant trade sanctions or export control laws. We have submitted a voluntary disclosure report to relevant U.S. government agencies regarding these transactions. As a result of these transactions, we may be subject to fines or other sanctions.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental and health and safety laws for which compliance, or liabilities that arise as a result of noncompliance, could be costly.\nOur businesses are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing emissions of regulated air pollutants; discharges of wastewater and storm water; storage and handling of raw materials; the use, manufacture, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials; generation, storage, transportation and disposal of regulated wastes; and laws and regulations governing worker safety. These requirements impose certain responsibilities on our businesses, including the obligation to obtain and maintain various environmental permits. If we were to fail to comply with these requirements or fail to obtain or maintain a required permit, we could be subject to penalties and be required to undertake corrective action measures to achieve compliance.\nIn addition, under various federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances, and, in some instances, international laws, relating to the protection of the environment, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate contamination on, under, or released from such property and for any damage to natural resources, such as soil or groundwater, resulting from such contamination. Similarly, a generator of waste can be held responsible for contamination resulting from the treatment or disposal of such waste at any off-site location (such as a landfill), regardless of whether the generator arranged for the treatment or disposal of the waste in compliance with applicable laws. Costs associated with liability for removal or remediation of contamination or damage to natural resources could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the responsible party knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants. Moreover, noncompliance could subject us to private claims for property damage or personal injury based on exposure to hazardous materials or unsafe working conditions. In addition, changes in applicable requirements or stricter interpretation of existing requirements may result in costly compliance requirements or otherwise subject us to future liabilities.\nIn addition, any environmental liability may be joint and several. Moreover, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties, or properties for which we are deemed responsible, may expose us to liability for property damage or personal injury, or materially adversely affect our ability to sell our real property interests or to borrow using the real property as collateral. We could be subject to environmental liabilities in the future as a result of historic or current operations that have resulted or will result in contamination.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral and Other Risks\nChanges in the general economy and the cyclical nature of the markets that we serve could negatively impact the demand for our products and services and harm our operations and financial performance.\nOur financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy, which impacts these markets. For example, the COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in widespread economic disruption which has severely impacted, and will likely continue to severely impact, our business and demand for our products and services. Any sustained weakness in demand for our products and services resulting from a downturn of or uncertainty in the global economy could reduce our sales and profitability. In addition, we believe that many of our customers and suppliers are reliant on liquidity from global credit markets and, in some cases, require external financing to purchase products or finance operations. If our customers lack liquidity or are unable to access the credit markets, it may impact customer demand for our products and services and we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us. Further, our products are\nsold in many industries, some of which are cyclical and may experience periodic downturns. Cyclical weakness in the industries that we serve could lead to reduced demand for our products and affect our profitability and financial performance. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key leadership could have a material adverse effect on our ability to run our business.\nWe may be adversely affected if we lose members of our senior leadership. We are highly dependent on our senior leadership team as a result of their expertise in our industry and our business. The loss of key leadership or the inability to attract, retain and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe issuances of additional Common and Preferred stock or the resale of previously restricted Common stock may adversely affect the market price of Colfax Common stock.\nPursuant to certain registration rights agreements we have entered with Mitchell P. Rales, Steven M. Rales and Markel Corporation (collectively, the \u201cInvestors\u201d), the Investors and their permitted transferees have registration rights for the resale of certain shares of Colfax Common stock. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of Colfax Common stock available for public trading. Sales by the Investors or their permitted transferees of a substantial number of shares of Colfax Common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of Colfax Common stock.\nAdditionally, under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, there are additional authorized shares of Colfax Common stock. Furthermore, we may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares, either into the marketplace through an existing shelf registration statement or through other mechanisms. Additional shares issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.\nProvisions in our governing documents and Delaware law, and the percentage of Common stock owned by our largest stockholders, may delay or prevent an acquisition of Colfax that may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that may make it difficult for a third-party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These include provisions prohibiting stockholders from taking action by written consent, prohibiting special meetings of stockholders called by stockholders, prohibiting stockholder nominations and approvals without complying with specific advance notice requirements, and mandating certain procedural steps for stockholders who wish to introduce business or nominate a director candidate. In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue Preferred stock without stockholder approval, which our Board of Directors could use to affect a rights plan or \u201cpoison pill\u201d that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer and may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing an acquisition of Colfax. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between Colfax and any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock.", "PERMNO": 92648, "SIC": 3540, "TIC": "CFX"}
