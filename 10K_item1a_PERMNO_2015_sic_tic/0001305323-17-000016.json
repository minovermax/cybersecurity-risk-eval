{"cik": "1305323", "company": "Bridgepoint Education Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our annual consolidated financial statements and the information set forth in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d and Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may impact our business operations. Any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In these circumstances, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Extensive Regulation of Our Business\nIf our institutions fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, they could face monetary liabilities or penalties, operational restrictions, or loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs from which we derive most of our revenue.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be (i) legally authorized to operate in the state in which it is physically located, (ii) accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department as a reliable indicator of educational quality and (iii) certified as an eligible institution by the Department. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulation by the Department, WSCUC and HLC (our institutions' accrediting agencies), and state education agencies. These regulatory requirements cover many aspects of our operations. They also restrict our ability to acquire or open new schools, add new educational programs, expand existing educational programs, change our corporate structure or ownership, and make other substantive changes to our business. Given that the Department, WSCUC, HLC and state education agencies periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements, we cannot reliably predict how these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether we will be able to comply with all of the requirements. If one of our institutions fails to comply with these regulatory requirements, the Department could impose sanctions on that institution, including monetary liabilities or penalties, operational restrictions, or loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs from which we derive most of our revenue. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Potential effect of noncompliance with Title IV regulations\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d If our institutions were to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or were to have such participation substantially curtailed, enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur institutions must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review or other action by the Department in connection with such recertification.\nAn institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review or other action by the Department in connection with such recertification. The current certification for University of the Rockies expired on June 30, 2016, and Ashford University was provisionally certified until September 30, 2016. Both universities have submitted applications for recertification and their eligibility continues on a month-to-month basis pending the Department's issuance of a decision on their respective applications. The Department may review an institution's continued certification to participate in Title IV programs in the event of a change of control, and may take emergency action to suspend an institution's certification without advance notice if it determines the institution is violating Title IV requirements and immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Title IV funds. If the Department revokes or does not renew our institutions' certifications to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions' students would no longer be able to receive Title IV funds, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford University is provisionally certified by the Department, which may make it more vulnerable to unfavorable Department action and place additional regulatory burdens on its operations.\nAshford University is currently provisionally certified by the Department on a month-to-month basis pending the Department's issuance of a decision on Ashford's application for recertification. The Department typically places an institution on provisional certification following a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, and may provisionally certify an institution for other reasons including, but not limited to, failure to comply with certain standards of administrative capability or financial responsibility. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it may be subject to adverse action with fewer due process rights than those afforded to other institutions. For example, Ashford's provisional status could subject it to additional sanctions if the Department were to find that Ashford engaged in substantial misrepresentation, including the revocation of its program participation agreement or the imposition of limitations on its participation in Title IV programs. In addition, an institution that is provisionally certified must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change including, but not limited to, the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings or the addition of certain programs. Any adverse action by the Department or increased regulatory burdens as a result\nof Ashford's provisional status could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions' failure to maintain accreditation would denigrate the value of their educational programs and result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nAn institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department to participate in Title IV programs. Ashford University is accredited by WSCUC and University of the Rockies is accredited by HLC. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Accreditation - Evaluations and renewals of accreditation\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d Each of WSCUC and HLC is recognized by the Department as a reliable authority regarding the quality of education and training provided by the institutions it accredits. To remain accredited, our institutions must continuously meet accreditation standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. If either of our institutions fails to satisfy any of the standards of its accrediting agency, it could lose its accreditation. Loss of accreditation by either of our institutions would denigrate the value of its educational programs and would result in its loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf WSCUC or HLC loses recognition by the Department, our institutions could lose their ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nIn order to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by the Department. Both WSCUC and HLC are recognized by the Department. If the Department ceased to recognize WSCUC or HLC for any reason, Ashford University or University of the Rockies, as applicable, would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs unless the Department continued to certify the eligibility of the institutions to participate in Title IV programs. The Department may continue to certify an institution for a period of no longer than 18 months after the date on which recognition of the accrediting body ceased. The inability of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they are not legally authorized to operate in the states in which they are physically located.\nTo be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - State authorization\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d Ashford University's California facilities have been designated as its main campus for Title IV purposes, and Ashford also has a campus located in Iowa. Ashford has been authorized by the BPPE to operate in California and is registered as a postsecondary school in Iowa by ICSAC. University of the Rockies is located in Colorado and is authorized to operate by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. To maintain these authorizations and registrations, Ashford University and University of the Rockies must comply with applicable requirements under the statutes and rules of the applicable state. Any loss of authorization to operate by our institutions and the resulting imposition of sanctions, including the loss of authorization to deliver educational programs and grant degrees and other credentials and the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the regulations of various states where we are not physically located could preclude us from recruiting or enrolling students in those states or result in such students being ineligible to receive Title IV funds.\nDepartment regulations provide that if an institution is offering postsecondary education through distance or correspondence education to students in a state in which it is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state, the institution must meet any state requirements in order to legally offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education to students in that state. Several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that offer educational services to students who reside in the state or that advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. We have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the applicable state education agency, and we have obtained state education agency approvals in certain states as determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - State Education Licensure and Regulation - Additional state regulation\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nOur changing business and the constantly changing regulatory environment require us to regularly evaluate our state regulatory compliance activities. Although our institutions have a process for evaluating the compliance of their online educational programs with state requirements regarding distance and correspondence learning, state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states, and are\nsubject to change. Consequently, a state education agency could disagree with our conclusion that we are not required to obtain a license or authorization in the state or could determine that we are not in compliance with state requirements, and may subject us to sanctions including the loss of state licensure or authorization, imposition of restrictions on our activities in the state, or imposition of fines and penalties. In addition, any failure to comply with state regulatory requirements, or any enactment of new or modified state regulations, may result in our inability to enroll students or receive Title IV funds for students in those states, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford University is approved by the BPPE to operate in California, which presents a greater reporting burden and may subject the university to increased regulatory or political scrutiny.\nIn connection with its transition to WSCUC accreditation, Ashford University designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus for Title IV purposes and submitted an Application for Approval to Operate an Accredited Institution to the BPPE on September 10, 2013. In April 2014, Ashford\u2019s application was granted and the university was approved by the BPPE to operate in California until July 15, 2018. As a result, the university is subject to laws and regulations applicable to private, postsecondary educational institutions located in California, including reporting requirements related to graduation, employment and licensing data, certain changes of ownership and control, faculty and programs, and student refund policies. Ashford also remains subject to other state and federal student employment data reporting and disclosure requirements. In addition, the BPPE is required to conduct compliance inspections for its approved institutions, and on October 12, 2016, the BPPE conducted a compliance inspection of Ashford University. Ashford is working with the BPPE to resolve any issues identified in connection with the compliance inspection. Compliance with the additional reporting and disclosure obligations arising as a result of Ashford's operation as a BPPE-approved institution may result in material additional costs and increased regulatory or political scrutiny of the university.\nOur institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they derive more than 90% of their respective revenues from these programs.\nUnder the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues (calculated in accordance with Department regulations) from Title IV program funds for two consecutive fiscal years. This rule is commonly referred to as the \u201c90/10 rule.\u201d Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Ashford University derived 81.2%, 80.9% and 83.4%, respectively, and University of the Rockies derived 86.5%, 86.6% and 88.3%, respectively, of their respective revenues from Title IV program funds. Ashford University and University of the Rockies continue to monitor their respective 90/10 rule calculations and their compliance with the 90/10 rule.\nRevenue derived from government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is not considered federal student aid for purposes of calculations under the 90/10 rule, and accordingly helps our institutions satisfy the 90/10 rule. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 25.6% of our institutions' students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive government tuition assistance that may be used to pursue postsecondary degrees. If there were a reduction in funding of government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or if our revenue derived from such funding were otherwise to decrease, it could be significantly more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule. On May 20, 2016, the Company received a letter from the Iowa Department of Education (the \u201cIowa DOE\u201d) indicating that, as a result of the planned closure of the Clinton Campus, the ISAA would no longer continue to approve Ashford\u2019s programs for GI Bill benefits after June 30, 2016. The Iowa DOE subsequently issued a stay of the ISAA\u2019s withdrawal of approval of Ashford\u2019s programs for GI Bill benefits until 90 days from June 20, 2016. On September 15, 2016, in response to a Petition for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief filed by Ashford University, the Iowa District Court for Polk County entered a written order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) staying the Iowa DOE\u2019s announced intention to withdraw the approval of Ashford as a GI Bill eligible institution until the entry of a final and appealable order and judgment in the action. Pursuant to the Order, the ISAA will continue to approve Ashford\u2019s programs for GI Bill benefits until such final and appealable order has been entered. At this time, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of this litigation, and any potential delays or gaps in coverage for GI Bill benefits could have a material adverse effect on current and future military student enrollment and the Company\u2019s revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could make it significantly more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule.\nChanges in federal law that increase Title IV grant and loan limits may result in an increase in the revenues we receive from Title IV programs and make it more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule. In addition, Congress could propose and adopt legislation that amends the 90/10 rule in ways that make it more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule. Failure to satisfy the 90/10 rule could result in our institutions losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs,\nwhich would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if too many students default on their loans.\nFor each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults over a three-year measuring period for each educational institution, which is known as a \u201ccohort default rate.\u201d An institution may lose its eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program if for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years 30% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year. The most recent official three-year cohort default rates for Ashford University for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 federal fiscal years were 14.5%, 15.3% and 15.3%, respectively. The most recent official three-year cohort default rates for University of the Rockies for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 federal fiscal years were 3.8%, 4.3% and 6.6%, respectively. If too many of our institutions' students were to default on their loans resulting in an increase in our institutions' respective cohort default rates, our institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe failure of our institutions to demonstrate financial responsibility may result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or require the posting of a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department. For additional information regarding the Department's financial responsibility requirements, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Financial responsibility\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d One measure of financial responsibility is an institution's composite score, a number between negative 1.0 and positive 3.0. An institution's composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further Department oversight. We expect the consolidated composite score to be 2.0 for the year ended December 31, 2016; however, the consolidated calculation is subject to determination by the Department once it receives and reviews our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. If our institutions are found not to have satisfied the Department's financial responsibility requirements, they could be limited in their access to or lose Title IV program funding, or they may be required to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department and possibly accept other conditions to their participation in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe are susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs. Our systems and processes may not always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened because we are an online education provider. We must maintain systems and processes to successfully identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid.\nThe Department's regulations require institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the OIG credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. If the systems and processes that we have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, the Department may find that we do not satisfy its \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements. In addition, our institutions' ability to participate in Title IV programs is conditioned on their maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Department. Under the Higher Education Act, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions offering distance learning programs, as our institutions do, must require such institutions to have processes by which they establish that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. Failure to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause our institutions to fail to meet their accrediting agencies' standards and result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of such accrediting agencies. Any failure to satisfy the Department's administrative capability requirements or any loss of accreditation as a result of a failure to detect and prevent fraudulent activity could result in limits on or loss of our institutions' eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they pay incentive compensation to persons or entities involved in certain recruiting, admissions or financial aid awarding activities.\nThe Higher Education Act prohibits an institution from providing any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities involved in student recruiting or admissions activities or making decisions about the award of student financial assistance. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Incentive compensation\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d The criteria for complying with the Department's rules prohibiting incentive compensation are not clear in all circumstances, and the Department will not review or approve compensation plans prior to their implementation.\nIf it were determined that one of our institutions violated the incentive compensation rule, the institution could be subject to monetary liabilities or administrative action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if the Department or other federal agencies determine they have misrepresented the nature of educational programs, financial charges or graduate employability.\nThe Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. Given the Department's broad definition of \u201csubstantial misrepresentation,\u201d it is possible that despite our training efforts and compliance programs, our institutions' employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. In addition to the Department's prohibition on substantial misrepresentation, for-profit educational institutions are subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC and the CFPB. The FSA is currently investigating representations made by Ashford University to potential and enrolled students, and has asked us and Ashford to assist in its assessment of Ashford's compliance with the prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. We, together with Ashford, intend to provide the FSA with our full cooperation with a view toward demonstrating the compliant nature of our practices. In addition, the Department is currently conducting an off-site program review to assess Ashford's administration of the Title IV programs in which it participates, which covers in part students identified in the 2009-2012 calendar year data provided by Ashford to the Department in connection with the FSA's investigation. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Substantial misrepresentation\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nIf the Department determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the Department may (i) attempt to revoke the institution's program participation agreement if the institution is provisionally certified, (ii) impose limitations on the institution's participation in Title IV programs if the institution is provisionally certified, (iii) deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters or (iv) initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Because Ashford University is provisionally certified, it could be subject to the actions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above in addition to any other actions taken by the Department. The imposition of these sanctions, including the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they fail to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nAn institution participating in Title IV programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion, and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d Failure to make timely returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institution's annual financial aid compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years can result in an institution having to post a letter of credit equal to 25% of the amount of unearned Title IV funds the institution was required to return for its most recently completed fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our institutions did not exceed the 5% threshold for late refunds sampled. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and returned in a timely manner, an institution may also be subject to monetary liabilities or an action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its participation in Title IV programs.\nOur institutions may be required to modify or eliminate certain programs, or certain programs may lose Title IV eligibility, if they do not lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation, as determined by the Department.\nIn October 2014, the Department published gainful employment regulations impacting programs required to prepare graduates for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Almost all academic programs offered by Title IV-participating private sector institutions of higher education must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The gainful employment regulations became effective July 1, 2015, with certain institutional disclosure requirements which became effective January 1, 2017. For additional information about the gainful employment regulations, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Gainful employment\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nOn October 20, 2016, we received draft debt-to-earnings rates and certain underlying data from the Department for the first gainful employment measurement year, and on January 8, 2017 we received our institutions' final debt-to-earnings rates for the first gainful employment measurement year. Based on the final rates, none of our programs were determined to fail, two of our current programs were determined to be in the zone and one additional program that was discontinued prior to the issuance of the gainful employment regulations was determined to be in the zone. These results are significant given the framework of the gainful employment regulations, as a program would be disqualified from participation in Title IV programs only if it were to fail for two out of three consecutive years, or either fail or be in the zone for three out of four consecutive years. The regulations contemplate a transition period in the first several years to afford institutions the opportunity to make changes to their programs and retain Title IV eligibility. We continue to review the information provided by the Department to understand the potential impact of the gainful employment regulations on our programs, and we will continue to evaluate options related to new programs or adjustments to current programs that could help mitigate the potential adverse consequences of the regulations.\nUnder the final gainful employment regulations, the continuing eligibility of certain of our educational programs for Title IV program funding is at risk due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including, without limitation, changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, and changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans. The factors noted above could reduce our ability to confidently offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is a market demand. Management is considering whether certain programs will be able to avoid falling into the fail or zone categories in the future through adjustments to program price or the duration of programs, if appropriate and consistent with programmatic standards and as permitted by applicable regulations. There can be no assurance that these adjustments will result in compliance with the gainful employment regulations. For programs where such adjustments are not feasible or do not result in compliance with the gainful employment regulations, we may discontinue such programs. The adjustment or discontinuation of any of our programs, or the loss of Title IV eligibility for certain of our programs if not adjusted or discontinued, could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe gainful employment regulations also provide that if a program fails to satisfy at least one of the two tests set forth in the regulations relating to minimum student debt service-to-earnings ratios, the institution will be required to provide a warning notice to prospective and enrolled students advising them that the program may lose Title IV eligibility based on final student debt service-to-earnings ratios for the next award year. If we are required to provide a warning notice with respect to any of our programs, it could have a material adverse effect on enrollment in those programs even before any determination has been made regarding eligibility of the program to participate in Title IV programs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure of our institutions to demonstrate compliance with state laws may result in liability to, or remedial action against, our institutions, including recoupment by the Department of discharged student loan funds under the \u201cdefense to repayment\u201d provisions of the Direct Loan Program regulations.\nThe current defense to repayment provisions of the Direct Loan Program regulations, which remain in effect until July 1, 2017, allow a student to assert as a defense against repayment of federal direct loans any commission of fraud or other violation of applicable state law by the school related to such loans or the educational services for which the loans were provided. The failure of our institutions to comply with state laws may result in liability to, or remedial action against, our institutions, including recoupment by the Department of discharged student loan funds under the \u201cdefense to repayment\u201d provisions. The assertion of any claims by our institutions' students under the defense to repayment provisions and any resulting remedial action, or any recoupment by the Department of discharged student loan funds pursuant to the defense to repayment provisions, could damage our reputation in the industry and have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Department\u2019s new regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment expand the circumstances in which students may assert a defense to repayment against an institution and also provide that certain conditions or events could trigger, automatically or in some cases at the Department\u2019s discretion, a requirement that an institution post a letter of credit or other security that could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.\nThe current standard for determining whether a borrower has a defense to repayment of a student loan allows borrowers to assert a defense to repayment if a cause of action would have arisen under applicable state law. On October 28, 2016, the Department issued new regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment that allow a borrower to assert a defense to repayment on the basis of a substantial misrepresentation, any other misrepresentation in cases where certain other factors are present, a breach of contract or a favorable nondefault contested judgment against a school for its act or omission relating to the making of the borrower\u2019s loan or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided. The new standard applies to student loans made after July 1, 2017, the effective date of the new regulations. In addition, the financial responsibility standards contained in the new regulations establish the conditions or events that trigger the requirement for an institution to provide the Department with financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or other security against potential institutional liabilities. Triggering conditions or events include, among others, certain state, federal or accrediting agency actions or investigations, and in the case of publicly traded companies, receipt of certain warnings from the SEC or the applicable stock exchange, or the failure to timely file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC. The new regulations also prohibit schools from requiring that students agree to settle future disputes through arbitration.\nUnder the new regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment, our institutions could face claims by students based on the expanded circumstances in which students may assert a defense to repayment of their student loans, and the Department may be entitled to seek recoupment of student loans discharged pursuant to the regulations. The FSA is currently investigating representations made by Ashford University to potential and enrolled students, and has asked the Company and Ashford to assist in its assessment of Ashford\u2019s compliance with the prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. In addition, our institutions are from time to time subject to certain actions or investigations by various state, federal or accrediting agencies, and as a public company we would be subject to the additional triggering events outlined by the Department in the new regulations; therefore, we may be required to post a letter of credit or provide some other form of security to the Department, which could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Any assertion by our institutions\u2019 students of defenses to repayment, including any resulting liability to, or remedial action against, our institutions, and any significant restrictions imposed on us or our ability to operate resulting from a requirement to post a letter of credit or other security, could damage our reputation in the industry and have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions cannot offer new programs, expand their physical operations into certain states or acquire additional schools if such actions are not approved in a timely fashion by the applicable regulatory agencies, and Title IV funds disbursed to students enrolled in any such programs, states or acquired schools may have to be repaid if prior approval is not obtained.\nOur operating plans may include the offering of new educational programs by our institutions, some of which may require regulatory approval. In addition, we or our institutions may increase physical operations in additional states or seek to acquire additional schools. Because Ashford University is provisionally certified, it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change, including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings or the addition of certain programs. If we or our institutions are unable to obtain the necessary approvals for such new programs, operations or acquisitions or, in the case of Ashford University, a substantial change, from the Department, WSCUC, HLC or any applicable state education agency or other accrediting agency, or if we or our institutions are unable to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, the ability to consummate such actions and provide Title IV funds to any affected students would be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we or our institutions were to determine erroneously that any such action did not require approval or that all required approvals have been obtained, our institutions could be liable for repayment of the Title IV program funds provided to students in the affected program or at the affected location, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf regulators do not approve, or if they delay their approval of, transactions involving a change of control of our company, our ability to participate in Title IV programs may be impaired.\nIf we or either of our institutions undergoes a change of control under the standards of the Department, WSCUC, HLC, or applicable state education agencies, we must seek the approval of each such regulatory agency. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Change in ownership resulting in a change of control\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d A failure by us or one of our institutions to reestablish its Department certification, accreditation or state authorization, as applicable, following a change of control could result in a suspension or loss of operating authority or the\nability to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nGovernmental proceedings or other claims and lawsuits asserting regulatory noncompliance could result in monetary liabilities or penalties, injunctions or loss of Title IV funding for students at our institutions.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we and our institutions are subject to compliance reviews, claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government under the federal False Claims Act. If the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to defend successfully against such lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions or other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. In addition, claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or adversely affect our stock price, even if such claims and lawsuits are eventually determined to be without merit. For additional information regarding claims and lawsuits, see Note 21, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nAdditional regulations or regulatory scrutiny resulting from action by the Department or other executive action could result in increased compliance costs, fines, sanctions or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn April 2016, the Department drafted a set of standards clarifying the information accreditors must submit, including the format in which information should be submitted, when notifying federal officials about actions taken against schools they accredit. The Department accepted public comments on the proposed standards through June 6, 2016, and plans to publish a final rule to be effective in July 2017.\nOn April 22, 2016, the Department issued a Dear Colleague Letter to federally recognized accrediting agencies regarding the flexibility those agencies have in differentiating their reviews of institutions and programs. The Department\u2019s letter encourages accrediting agencies to use that flexibility to focus monitoring and resources on student achievement and problematic institutions or programs. The Department also encourages regional accreditors, such as WSCUC and HLC, to consider adding the use of quantitative measures, in addition to the qualitative measures of student achievement already utilized, in reviewing institutions\u2019 processes for evaluating and validating student learning, and to consider licensing and placement rates in its accreditation of institutions that offer applied, professional and occupational programs.\nOn December 16, 2016, the Department released final regulations to clarify state authorization requirements for postsecondary institutions offering distance education that participate in federal student loan programs, as required by the Higher Education Act. Among other things, the final regulations (i) require institutions offering distance education to be authorized by each state in which they enroll students, if such authorization is required by the state, (ii) require institutions to document the state process for resolving student complaints regarding distance education programs, (iii) require public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students in distance education programs, including disclosures regarding adverse actions taken against the institution, the institution\u2019s refund policies and whether each of the institution\u2019s programs meet applicable state licensure or certification requirements, and (iv) require institutions to explain to students the consequences of moving to a state where the school is not authorized, which could include loss of eligibility for federal student aid. The final regulations recognize authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, as long as the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own consumer laws. The final regulations are scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2018.\nOn January 20, 2017, Reince Priebus, Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, issued a Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies with the subject \u201cRegulatory Freeze Pending Review\u201d pursuant to which a regulatory freeze was implemented to ensure that the President's appointees or designees have the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations, subject to certain exceptions. The issuance of this memorandum and the resulting regulatory freeze and review may affect the proprietary postsecondary education industry by delaying the schedule effective date or otherwise affecting the enactment of applicable regulations.\nWe cannot predict the scope and content of the regulations that may emerge from these or other rulemaking activities that the Department initiates or the consequences of increased executive regulatory scrutiny. The Company\u2019s compliance with these regulations or any additional or modified regulations, could result in direct and indirect costs related to compliance, increased scrutiny, fines, liabilities, sanctions or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAny action by Congress to revise the laws governing Title IV programs or to reduce funding for these programs could negatively impact our business.\nCongress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program through the budget and appropriations process. In 2008, the Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 2014, and the House Education and Workforce Committee is currently working to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act's programs will continue year-to-year without explicit reauthorization as long as Congress appropriates funds for the programs. Congress may propose and pass revisions to the Higher Education Act between reauthorizations by using other legislative vehicles such as budget bills and appropriations bills, which could impact funding for student financial aid programs. Certain members of Congress have proposed legislation that could have an adverse impact on our institutions. Even if this proposed legislation does not pass during the session in which it is introduced, it may be reintroduced or similar legislation may be proposed, or it may serve as a basis of discussion during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\nWe cannot predict what legislation, if any, will arise out of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act or other Congressional deliberations, or what impact any such legislation might have on the for-profit education sector and our business in particular. However, any action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the eligibility of our institutions or students to participate in Title IV programs, or that requires us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our administrative costs and reduce our profit margin, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other postsecondary institutions.\nIn recent years, Congressional, federal, state and accrediting agency investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several postsecondary educational institutions. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with Department regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. Although the media, regulatory and legislative focus has been primarily on the allegations made against these specific companies, broader allegations against the postsecondary sector may negatively impact public perceptions of all postsecondary educational institutions. Such allegations could result in increased scrutiny and regulation of all postsecondary institutions, including Ashford University and University of the Rockies, by the Department, Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures or other governmental authorities.\nAs a result of changes that have been made, or that may be required by the accreditors of our institutions, to our operational relationships with our institutions and to their operations and business models, our historical financial and business results may not necessarily be representative of future results.\nIn connection with the transition of Ashford University to WSCUC accreditation and our efforts to structure our operations to meet evolving regulatory expectations, our institutions have made operational changes and launched various new business initiatives, and additional changes may be required. These changes and initiatives included hiring new leadership, implementing smaller class sizes, requiring minimum age-levels for students, implementing the Ashford Promise (an initiative that allows students a full refund for all tuition and fees through the third week of a student's first class), hiring additional full-time faculty and implementing new program review models. Many of these changes and initiatives result in higher expense to the organization, primarily in the areas of instructional costs and services. In addition, we have made changes in our organizational structure and operational relationships with our academic institutions to ensure their academic independence and satisfaction of accreditation-related requirements. Some of these changes and initiatives have contributed to declines in new student enrollments. Accordingly, our historical results and trends, including enrollments, admissions advisory and marketing expenses, and instructional costs and services, may not be indicative of our future results, and there can be no assurance that changes to our operational relationship with our institutions or other changes we have made, or may make in the future, will not have an adverse impact on regulatory compliance, satisfaction of accreditation-related standards, or our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to continue to develop awareness among, and to recruit and retain, students; adverse publicity may negatively impact demand for our institutions' programs.\nBuilding awareness among potential students of Ashford University and University of the Rockies and the programs they offer is critical to their ability to attract prospective students. It is also critical to our success that these prospective students are converted to enrolled students in a cost-effective manner and that these enrolled students remain active in our institutions' programs. Some of the factors that could prevent the successful recruiting and retention of students in our institutions' programs include:\n\u2022\nthe emergence of more and better competitors;\n\u2022\nfactors related to our marketing efforts, including the costs of online advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;\n\u2022\nperformance problems with our online systems;\n\u2022\nour institutions' failure to maintain accreditation, state licensure and eligibility for Title IV programs;\n\u2022\nstudent dissatisfaction with our institutions' services and programs;\n\u2022\na decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our institutions' programs or programs provided by private sector postsecondary education companies generally;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity regarding us, or online or private sector postsecondary education generally;\n\u2022\nprice reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match; and\n\u2022\na decline in the acceptance of online education or education provided by private sector postsecondary education companies.\nWe face litigation and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe and our institutions are subject to lawsuits, investigations and claims covering a wide range of matters. We are the subject of complaints alleging violations of various laws including, but not limited to, federal securities laws (including a securities class action), the federal False Claims Act and state employment laws, as well as investigations by the SEC, the DOJ and state Attorneys General in California, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York and North Carolina. Derivative shareholder complaints have also been asserted on our behalf against certain of our current and former officers and directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. These and other legal proceedings could cause us to incur significant defense costs, are disruptive to our normal business operations and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. An adverse outcome of any legal proceeding could result in monetary losses or restrictions on our business, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFor additional information regarding current material legal proceedings involving us and our institutions, including investigations by the SEC, the DOJ and state Attorneys General in California, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York and North Carolina, see Note 21, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nAs a percentage of revenues, our bad debt expense is high relative to our competitors. If we are unable to remedy the underlying causes, our bad debt expense could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAs a percentage of revenues, our bad debt expense is high relative to our competitors and has increased from 5.3% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 6.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016. We believe our bad debt expense is primarily driven by operational policies, timing of financial aid processing and collection management. If we are unable to make appropriate changes, or if our changes are not as effective as anticipated, our bad debt expense could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFuture growth of our company may place a strain on our resources.\nWe experienced significant growth from the time of our initial public offering up through 2012, which increased demands on our management information and reporting systems, data analytics and financial management controls. Such historical\ngrowth, as well as any further growth that we may experience, may place a significant strain on our resources. If we are unable to maintain appropriate internal controls, we may experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs. Additionally, if we and our institutions fail to hire and retain appropriate levels of personnel in critical areas, we could experience increased student complaints, delays in completing critical business projects, system down-time for both internal and student-facing applications, and potential regulatory noncompliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nIf deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, we could be required to restate our financial results, which could adversely affect our stock price and result in our inability to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nIn the prior year, Management evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and concluded that each was ineffective as of December 31, 2015. The 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects management's conclusion regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. The existence of this prior issue could adversely affect us, our reputation and investors' perception of us.\nWe have since implemented measures to remediate the underlying causes of those control deficiencies. See Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results, which could adversely affect our stock price and result in our inability to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nA failure of our information systems to properly store, process and report relevant data may reduce our management\u2019s effectiveness, interfere with our regulatory compliance and increase our operating expenses.\nWe are heavily dependent on the integrity of our data management systems. If these systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired. Any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions rely on a third-party vendor to provide the online learning platform for students and related support and hosting.\nWe have a license agreement with eCollege pursuant to which we license from eCollege an online learning platform for students at our institutions. In September 2016, we entered into an agreement with Instructure pursuant to which we are in the process of migrating from the eCollege learning management system to the Canvas learning management system provided by Instructure. Our institutions currently rely on eCollege for administrative support and hosting of the applicable systems, and will rely on Instructure for administrative support and hosting of the applicable systems once we have migrated to the Canvas learning management system. If eCollege ceases to operate or is unwilling or unable to work with our institutions prior to completion of the migration, if we encounter any issues with Instructure in the process of migrating to the Canvas learning management system, or if our agreement with Instructure is otherwise terminated, the online learning platform for students at our institutions and related administrative support and hosting could be interrupted or become unavailable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations as a result of our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of such laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of such information, could adversely affect our business.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our applicants, students, faculty, staff and their families. We also collect and maintain personal information about our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Our services can be accessed globally through the Internet. Therefore, we may be subject to the application of national privacy laws in countries outside the United States from which applicants and students access our services. Such privacy laws could impose conditions that limit the way we market and provide our services.\nOur computer networks and the networks of certain of our vendors that hold and manage confidential information on our behalf may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, employee theft or misuse, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security threats. Confidential information may also inadvertently become available to third parties when we integrate systems or migrate data to our servers following an acquisition of a school or in connection with periodic hardware or software\nupgrades. Due to the sensitive nature of the personal information stored on our servers, our networks may be targeted by hackers seeking to access this data. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate sensitive information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of privacy for current or prospective students or employees.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and could restrict our use of personal information, and a violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information could result in the imposition of fines against us or lawsuits brought against us. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. A major breach, theft or loss of personal information held by us or our vendors regarding our institutions' students and their families or our employees, or a violation of laws or regulations relating to the same, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, result in lawsuits and result in further regulation and oversight by federal and state authorities and increased costs of compliance.\nSystem disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our technology infrastructure could damage the reputation of our institutions and negatively impact our business.\nThe performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure (including the software and related hosting and maintenance services for our online learning platform, student information system, and lead management system) is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of systems to us or our institutions' students and negatively impact our business and reputation. Our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other security problems. Although we continually monitor the security of our technology infrastructure and take proactive measures to prevent potential threats, these efforts may not protect our computer networks against all threats of security breaches, which could damage the reputation of our institutions and negatively impact our business and prospects.\nOur expenses may cause us to incur additional operating losses if we do not realize our expected revenues.\nOur spending is based in significant part on our estimates of future revenue and is largely fixed in the short term. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner if our revenue falls short of our expectations. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations would have an immediate and material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, we anticipate increasing operating expenses to expand program offerings and marketing initiatives. Any such increase could cause material losses to the extent we do not generate additional revenues sufficient to cover those expenses.\nIntense competition in the postsecondary education market, especially in the online education market, could decrease our market share, increase our cost of recruiting students and put downward pressure on our tuition rates.\nPostsecondary education is highly competitive. We compete with traditional public and private two- and four-year colleges as well as with other postsecondary schools. Traditional colleges and universities may offer programs similar to those offered by our institutions at lower tuition levels as a result of government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to for-profit postsecondary institutions. In addition, our institutions face continued scrutiny from their accreditors, and some of our competitors, including traditional colleges and universities, have substantially greater brand recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students. We also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including traditional colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business. We may be required to reduce our tuition or increase marketing spending in order to attract or retain students or to pursue new market opportunities. We may also face increased competition in maintaining and developing new marketing relationships with corporations, particularly as corporations become more selective as to which online universities they will encourage or offer scholarships to their employees to attend and from which online universities they will hire prospective employees.\nWe may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, efforts and motivations of our executive officers, who generally have significant experience with our company and within the education industry. Due to the nature of our business, we face significant competition in attracting and retaining personnel who possess the skill sets we seek. In addition, key personnel may leave us and may subsequently compete against us. We do not carry life insurance on our key personnel for our benefit. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to sustain and grow our business. In addition, because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our hiring of qualified executives or other personnel may cause us or such persons to be subject to lawsuits alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, improper solicitation of employees or other claims.\nIf we are unable to hire new employees or to continue to develop existing employees responsible for student recruitment, the effectiveness of our student admissions efforts would be adversely affected.\nWe intend to (i) hire, develop and train additional employees responsible for student admissions and (ii) retain and continue to develop and train our current student admissions personnel. Our ability to develop and maintain a strong student admissions function may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to integrate and motivate our admissions counselors, our ability to effectively train our admissions counselors, the length of time it takes new admissions counselors to become productive, regulatory restrictions on the method of compensating admissions counselors and the competition involved in hiring and retaining admissions counselors. If we are unable to hire new employees or retain and develop current employees responsible for student admissions, it could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nEnrollment and revenues could decrease if government tuition assistance offered to military personnel is reduced, suspended or eliminated, if scholarships which we offer to military personnel are reduced or eliminated, or if our relationships with military bases deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 25.6% of our institutions' students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive government tuition assistance that may be used to pursue postsecondary degrees. In some cases we also provide scholarships to students who are affiliated with the military. If government tuition assistance offered to military personnel is suspended or otherwise reduced or eliminated, enrollment by military personnel, including veterans, may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, if in response to future reductions or suspensions in military tuition assistance we determine to reinstitute our Military Tuition Assistance Grant or a similar program, or if we increase our scholarships to students who are affiliated with the military, our per student revenue from military personnel would decline.\nWe maintain relationships with military bases and provide scholarships to students who are affiliated with the military. If our relationship with any military base deteriorates or we reduce or eliminate these scholarships, enrollment by military personnel, including veterans, may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA decline in the overall growth of enrollment in postsecondary institutions, or in the number of students seeking degrees online or in our core disciplines, could cause us to experience a further decline in enrollment at our institutions.\nEnrollment at our institutions declined to 45,087 at December 31, 2016 as compared to 49,159 at December 31, 2015, and our revenues have declined in recent periods and may continue to decline in the future. In addition, if job growth in the fields related to our institutions' core disciplines is weaker than expected, fewer students may seek the types of degrees that our institutions offer. In order to return to growth in our revenues and increase enrollment at our institutions, our institutions will need to attract and retain a larger percentage of students in existing markets and expand their markets by creating new academic programs. Any further decline in enrollment at our institutions as a result of our inability to attract and retain students in existing markets or expand our markets by creating new academic programs in areas where there is market demand could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our institutions' ability to update and expand the content of existing programs and to develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner.\nThe updates and expansions of existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or prospective employers of our institutions' graduates. If we do not adequately respond to changes in market requirements by updating and expanding our existing programs or developing new programs, our business will be adversely affected. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, our institutions may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our operations. In addition, to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs, a new academic program may need to be approved by the Department.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires investments in management and capital expenditures, additional marketing expenses and reallocation of other resources. We and our institutions may have limited experience with programs in new disciplines and may need to modify existing systems and strategies or enter into arrangements with other educational institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably. If our institutions are unable to increase enrollment in new programs, offer new programs in a cost-effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur failure to keep pace with changing market needs could harm our institutions' ability to attract students.\nOur success depends to a large extent on the willingness of employers to hire, promote or increase the pay of our institutions' graduates. Increasingly, employers demand that their new employees possess appropriate technical and analytical skills and also appropriate interpersonal skills, such as communication and teamwork. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important that our institutions' educational programs continually evolve in response to those economic and technological changes.\nThe expansion of existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or by prospective employers of our institutions' graduates. Even if our institutions develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to begin offering those new programs in a timely fashion or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, the rates at which our institutions' graduates obtain jobs in their fields of study could suffer, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to sufficiently protect our proprietary rights and we may encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of the intellectual property of third parties.\nWe rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. We also own the domain name rights for our institutions, as well as other words and phrases important to our business. In addition, we have applied for domestic and international patents for certain technology developed by us. We also have registered copyrights for exemplary business course materials. Nonetheless, as new challenges arise in protecting these proprietary rights online, we cannot assure you that these measures will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the United States or select foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our technology, curricula and online resource material, among others. Our management's attention may be diverted by these attempts, and we may need to expend funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation.\nWe may also encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. In certain instances, we may not have obtained sufficient rights to the content of a course. Third parties may raise claims against us alleging an infringement or violation of their intellectual property. Some third-party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid all alleged violations of such intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to pay monetary damages, which may be significant, or our institutions may be required to alter the content of their classes to be non-infringing.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions.\nIn some instances, our institutions' faculty members or students may post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards. We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions. Third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and could impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel, regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages.\nGovernment regulations relating to the Internet could increase our cost of doing business, affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services has led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or in foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect enrollments.\nWe may require additional financing in the future and if such financing is not available on terms acceptable to us, it could adversely affect our ability to grow.\nWe believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our current operating plans for the foreseeable future. However, we may need additional financing in order to finance our plans, particularly if we pursue any acquisitions. The amount, timing and terms of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of new program offerings, the timing and size of acquisitions we may seek to consummate and the amount of cash flows from our operations. To the extent that we require additional financing in the future, such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all and, consequently, we may not be able to fully implement our plans.\nA protracted economic slowdown and rising unemployment could lead to lower enrollment and impact our students' ability to repay their loans.\nWe believe that many students pursue postsecondary education to be more competitive in the job market. However, a protracted economic slowdown could increase unemployment and diminish job prospects generally. Diminished job prospects and heightened financial worries could affect the willingness of students to incur loans to pay for postsecondary education and to pursue postsecondary education in general. As a result, enrollments could suffer.\nIn addition, many of our institutions' students borrow Title IV loans to pay for tuition, fees and other expenses. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact their ability to repay those loans which would negatively impact our institutions' cohort default rates. Our institutions' students also are frequently able to borrow Title IV loans in excess of their tuition. The excess is received by such students as a stipend. However, if a student withdraws, we must return any unearned Title IV funds, including stipends. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact such students' ability to repay those stipends. As a result, the amount of Title IV funds we would have to return without reimbursement from students could increase, and our results of operations could suffer.\nIf we fail to effectively identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions, either in the U.S. or outside of the U.S., our ability to grow could be impacted and our profitability may be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions are one component of our overall long-term growth strategy. From time to time, we engage in evaluations of, and discussions with, possible domestic and international acquisition candidates. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, or successfully integrate or profitably operate acquired institutions or businesses. There may be particular difficulties and complexities (regulatory or otherwise) associated with our expansion into international markets, and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets. If we are unable to effectively address these challenges, our ability to execute this component of our long-term strategy will be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow and our profitability.\nThe acquisition, integration and growth of acquired businesses may present challenges that could harm our business.\nThe successful integration and profitable operation of an acquired institution or business, including the realization of anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities, can present challenges, and the failure to overcome these challenges can have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Some of these challenges include:\n\u2022\nthe inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management's attention from normal business operations during the integration process;\n\u2022\nthe inability to attract and/or retain key management personnel to operate the acquired entity;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory or other approvals necessary to operate the business;\n\u2022\nthe inability to correctly estimate the size of a target market or accurately assess market dynamics;\n\u2022\nexpenses associated with the integration efforts; and\n\u2022\nunidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process, including legal contingencies.\nAn acquisition related to an institution or other educational business often requires one or multiple regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain such approvals, or we obtain them on unfavorable terms, our ability to consummate a transaction may be impaired or we may be unable to operate the acquired entity in a manner that is favorable to us. If we fail to properly evaluate an acquisition, we may be required to incur costs in excess of what we anticipated, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisition.\nWe may finance a future acquisition with existing funds or funds raised through debt or equity financing. If we use existing funds, we will lower the amount of funds we currently have. If we arrange for alternative financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms. In addition, equity financing could dilute the holdings of our stockholders, which may affect our stock price.\nAn increase in interest rates could adversely affect our institutions' ability to attract and retain students.\nInterest rates have reached relatively low levels in recent years, creating a favorable borrowing environment for students. However, if Congress increases interest rates on Title IV loans, or if private loan interest rates rise, our institutions' students would have to pay higher interest rates on their loans. Any future increase in interest rates will result in a corresponding increase in educational costs to existing and prospective students. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to students' repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact our institutions' eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations governing our activities could result in financial penalties and other costs.\nWe use hazardous materials at our ground campuses and generate small quantities of waste, such as used oil, antifreeze, paint, car batteries and laboratory materials. Additionally, we have identified minor environmental issues at the property near the Clinton Campus. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and the clean-up of contamination at our facilities or off-site locations to which we send or have sent waste for disposal. If we do not maintain compliance with any of these environmental laws and regulations, or we are responsible for a spill or release of hazardous materials, we could incur significant costs for clean-up, damages and fines or penalties.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and may continue to fluctuate significantly for a variety of different reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding the accreditation or state licensing of our academic institutions, particularly Ashford University;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\npublic reaction to our press releases, corporate communications and SEC filings;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in our student enrollment;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our industry or business;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, including government hearings and other public lawmaker or regulator criticism, regarding our industry or business;\n\u2022\nchanges in enrollment;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. Changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company.\nSales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nIf our stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. At December 31, 2016, 46.5 million shares of our common stock were outstanding.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2016, there were 3.6 million shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock options and 2.1 million shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock awards, including restricted stock units and performance stock units. All shares subject to outstanding stock options are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of the applicable stock option agreement and Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Under Rule 144, shares held by non-affiliates for more than six months may generally be sold without restriction, other than a current public information requirement, and may be sold freely without any restrictions after one year. Shares held by affiliates may also be sold under Rule 144 after one year, subject to applicable restrictions, including volume and manner of sale limitations.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely or cease to cover our company, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business or industry. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nOur principal stockholder has significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval and access to our management.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Warburg Pincus beneficially owned 59.6% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Warburg Pincus may exercise significant influence over the election of our directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders, including mergers, going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions. The ownership position of Warburg Pincus may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or a change in the composition of our board of directors.\nIn February 2009, we entered into a nominating agreement with Warburg Pincus. Under the nominating agreement, as long as Warburg Pincus beneficially owns at least 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, we will, subject to our fiduciary obligations, nominate and recommend to our stockholders that two individuals designated by Warburg Pincus be elected to our board of directors. Additionally, if Warburg Pincus beneficially owns less than 15% but more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, we will, subject to our fiduciary obligations, nominate and recommend to our stockholders that one individual designated by Warburg Pincus be elected to our board of directors. As of December 31, 2016, two directors served on our board of directors.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future and we intend to use our cash position to grow our business. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in our common stock will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nSubject to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), our board of directors has the authority, without any action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock. At December 31, 2016, there were 300.0 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, 46.5 million shares of which were outstanding. At December 31, 2016, there were 20.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, no shares of which were outstanding. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce the influence of our current stockholders over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in the rights of our current stockholders being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors (three classes);\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprovide that a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our board of directors or by our chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nprovide that action by written consent of the stockholders may be taken only if the board of directors first approves such action, except that if Warburg Pincus holds at least 50% of our outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis, whenever the vote of stockholders is required at a meeting for any corporate action, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with, and the action may be taken without such meeting and vote, if a written consent is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at the meeting of stockholders; provided that, notwithstanding the\nforegoing, we will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with NYSE rules for so long as our shares are listed on the NYSE, and as otherwise required by the bylaws;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.", "PERMNO": 92902, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "ZVO"}
