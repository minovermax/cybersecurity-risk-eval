{"cik": "880460", "company": "Perfumania Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following sets forth certain risk factors known to us that may materially adversely affect the Company and its results of operations or our shareholders\u2019 investment.\nWe are more leveraged following the Parlux acquisition than we have been historically\nIn order to complete our acquisition of Parlux, we incurred an additional $62.1 million of debt. Borrowings under our senior credit facility and our subordinated debt now total approximately $162.9 million. We and our subsidiaries must comply with various restrictive covenants in our credit facility. Among other things, these covenants limit our ability to:\n\u2022pay dividends;\n\u2022make distributions; and\n\u2022take other actions, such as making advances to suppliers.\nOur substantial debt could have important consequences such as:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or otherwise fully realize the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on the debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of the debt;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry; or\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to competitors that have less debt.\nRealization of any of these factors could adversely affect Perfumania\u2019s financial condition.\nWe could face liquidity and working capital constraints if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our obligations, we could face liquidity and working capital constraints, which could adversely impact our future operations and growth. If we need to raise additional funds to support our operations, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all. Without such funding, we may need to modify or abandon our growth strategy or eliminate product offerings, any of which could negatively impact our financial position.\nWe may have problems raising money needed in the future, which could adversely impact operations or existing shareholders\nOur growth strategy includes growing our portfolio of licensed and owned brands and selectively opening and operating new Perfumania retail locations. We may need to obtain funding to achieve our growth strategy. In part due to our existing debt, additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, which would adversely affect our operations. In order to obtain additional liquidity, we might issue additional common stock which could dilute our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership interest or we may be required to issue securities with greater rights than those currently possessed by holders of our common stock. We may also be required to take other actions which may lessen the value of our common stock, including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable.\nThe beauty industry is highly competitive and if we cannot effectively compete, our business and results of operations will suffer\nThe beauty industry is highly competitive and can change rapidly due to consumer preferences and industry trends. Some of our competitors sell fragrances at discount prices and some are part of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources and name recognition than ours. Many of our competitors are global prestige beauty companies and multi-national consumer product companies who have greater financial, technical, operational, and marketing resources than we have and brands with greater name recognition than our brands. We may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors in developing our products and services. These factors, as well as demographic trends, economic conditions and discount pricing strategies by competitors, could result in increased competition and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, operating cash flow, and many other aspects of our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to acquire or license additional brands, our business may not grow as we expect\nOur business strategy contemplates growing our portfolio of licensed and owned brands. We may be unsuccessful in identifying, negotiating, financing and consummating desirable licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could hinder our ability to increase revenues. Additionally, even if we are able to consummate such licensing arrangements, we may not be able to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and portfolio of licenses or generate the expected levels of increased revenue as a result.\nAny new product we develop may not generate sufficient consumer interest and sales to become a profitable brand or even to cover the costs of its development and subsequent promotions\nOur success with new fragrance products depends on our products\u2019 appeal to a broad range of consumers, whose preferences are subject to change, and on our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends through product innovation. In addition, a number of the new launches are with celebrities (either entertainers or athletes) who require substantial royalty commitments and whose careers and/or public appeal could diminish dramatically with no warning. Net revenues and margins\non beauty products sometimes decline as they advance in their life cycles, so our revenues and margins could suffer if we do not successfully develop new products. Creating new products may place a strain on our resources. We may incur expenses in creating and developing new products that are not subsequently supported by a sufficient level of sales. If any of our new product introductions are unsuccessful, or if the appeal of the celebrity related to a product diminishes, it could materially impact our results of operations.\nParlux\u2019s business is dependent on department store sales, which presents special risks\nParlux usually launches its new fragrances through U.S. department stores. Department stores tend to lose sales to the mass market as a product matures. To counter this effect, Parlux has historically introduced new products quickly, which requires additional spending for development, advertising and promotional expenses. In addition, U.S. department stores have experienced a significant amount of consolidation in recent years. This has resulted in Parlux\u2019s increasing dependence on a smaller number of key retailers, enhancing their bargaining strength and resulting in increased risk. Continued department store consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur retail business is sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and overall consumer confidence\nOur business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including political and economic conditions such as recessionary environments, the levels of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, fuel and energy prices, the level of unemployment and consumer confidence. During periods of economic uncertainty or volatility in financial markets where consumer confidence is affected, consumer spending levels and customer traffic could decline, which would have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nAdverse U.S. and global economic conditions could affect our wholesale business\nA U.S. or global economic downturn could reduce the availability of credit for businesses. Some of our wholesale customers could experience a decline in financial performance. These conditions affect their ability to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all. There can be no assurance that government responses to potential economic disruptions would increase liquidity and the availability of credit, and as a result, our wholesale customers may be unable to borrow funds on acceptable terms. We extend credit to some of our wholesale customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition. Financial difficulties experienced by our wholesale customers could cause us to curtail or eliminate business with that customer. Any economic decline affecting our wholesale customers would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf Perfumania cannot successfully manage its growth, our business will be adversely affected\nWe may not be able to sustain growth in Perfumania's revenues. Perfumania\u2019s growth has been somewhat dependent upon opening and operating new retail stores on a profitable basis, which in turn is subject to, among other things, securing suitable store sites on satisfactory terms, hiring, training and retaining qualified management and other personnel, having adequate capital resources and successfully integrating new stores into existing operations. Circumstances outside our control could negatively affect these anticipated store openings. Perfumania\u2019s new stores may take up to three years to reach planned operating levels. It is possible that Perfumania\u2019s new stores might not achieve sales and profitability comparable to existing stores, and it is possible that the opening of new locations might adversely affect sales at existing locations. The failure to expand by successfully opening new stores as planned, or the failure of a significant number of these stores to perform as planned, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nThe market for real estate is competitive, which could adversely impact our results\nOur ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores depends upon the availability of real estate that meets our criteria, including traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors, and our ability to negotiate terms that meet our financial targets. In addition, we must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. Failure to secure real estate locations adequate to meet annual targets, as well as effectively managing the profitability of our existing stores, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our inventory, we will not achieve our expected results\nWe are exposed to inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, changes in customer preferences or demand, and consumer spending patterns. We must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. Demand for product can change between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale, especially with new products. In particular, our business includes a significant portion of consigned sales, and our revenue recognition policy defers recognition of revenue for this type of sale. Consignment sales remain in inventory until the products are sold to end users and, if not sold, the inventory may be returned to us upon termination of the consignment relationships. The turnover frequency of our inventory on consignment is critical to generating regular cash flow in amounts necessary to keep financing costs to targeted levels and to purchase additional inventory. If this turnover is not sufficiently frequent, our financing costs may exceed targeted levels and we may be unable to generate regular\ncash flow in amounts necessary to purchase additional inventory to meet the demand for other products. In addition, slow inventory turnover may force us to reduce prices and accept lower margins to sell consigned products. Any of these situations may impact our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could lead to fluctuations in our stock price\nWe have historically experienced and expect to continue experiencing higher sales in the fourth fiscal quarter than in any of the first three fiscal quarters. Purchases of fragrances as gift items increase during the holiday season, which results in significantly higher fourth fiscal quarter retail sales. Sales levels of new and existing stores are affected by a variety of factors, including the retail sales environment, the level of competition, the effect of marketing and promotional programs, acceptance of new product introductions, adverse weather conditions, general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nOur quarterly results may also vary as a result of the timing of new store openings and store closings, net sales contributed by new stores and fluctuations in comparable sales of existing stores. If our quarterly operating results are below expectations, our stock price might decline.\nWe may experience shortages of merchandise because we do not rely on long-term agreements with suppliers\nOur success depends to a large degree on our ability to provide an extensive assortment of brand name and designer fragrances. We do not rely on long-term purchase contracts or other contractual assurance of continued supply, pricing or access to new products. Suppliers of distributed brands generally may choose to reduce or eliminate the volume of their products we distribute, including supplying products to our wholesale customers directly or through another distributor. Our suppliers are generally able to cancel orders or delay the delivery of products on short notice. If we are unable to obtain merchandise from one or more key suppliers on a timely basis or acceptable terms, or if there is a material change in our ability to obtain necessary merchandise, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers and component suppliers for all of our owned and licensed product\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We use third-party manufacturers and component suppliers to manufacture all of our owned and licensed products. Our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our manufacturers or component suppliers were to experience problems with product quality, credit or liquidity issues, or disruptions or delays in the manufacturing process or delivery of the finished products or the raw materials or components used to make such products.\nWe could be subject to litigation because of the merchandising aspect of our business\nSome of the merchandise we purchase from suppliers might be manufactured by entities that are not the owners of the trademarks or copyrights for the merchandise. The owner of a particular trademark or copyright may challenge us to demonstrate that the specific merchandise was produced and sold with the proper authority, and if we are unable to demonstrate this, we could, among other things, be restricted from reselling the particular merchandise or be subjected to other liabilities. This type of restriction could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur stock price volatility could result in litigation, substantial cost, and diversion of management\u2019s attention\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events, such as:\n\u2022quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022acquisitions, capital commitments or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;\n\u2022legal and regulatory matters that are applicable to our business;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performances of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends in our markets; and\n\u2022the amount of shares constituting our public float.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the performance of specific companies. The broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Our stock price volatility could result in litigation, including class action lawsuits, which would require substantial monetary cost to defend, as well as the diversion of management attention from day-to-day activities which could negatively affect operating performance. Such litigation could also have a negative impact on the price of our common stock due to the uncertainty and negative publicity associated with litigation.\nFuture growth may place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources\nIf we grow as we anticipate, a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources may occur. Future growth or increase in the number of our strategic relationships could strain our managerial, operational and financial resources, inhibiting our ability to achieve the execution necessary to successfully implement our business plan.\nThe loss of or disruption in our distribution facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business\nWe currently have two distribution facilities located in Bellport, New York and Keasbey, New Jersey. In addition we use third-party fulfillment centers in New York and New Jersey. Any significant interruption to any of these facilities, due to natural disasters, severe weather accidents, system failures, or other unforeseen causes, as well as the loss or damage to the inventory stored therein, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nExpanding our business through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and technologies presents special risks that may disrupt our business\nWe have in the past and may in the future continue to expand through the acquisition of and investment in other businesses. Acquisitions involve a number of special problems, including:\n\u2022difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations, and personnel with our existing business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;\n\u2022the need for additional financing;\n\u2022\nstrain on managerial, operational and financial resources as management tries to oversee larger operations; and\n\u2022exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies.\nWe may not be able to successfully address these problems. Moreover, our future operating results will depend to a significant degree on our ability to successfully manage growth or integrate acquisitions.\nAny weakness in internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and lead to a stock price decline\nWe are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, as well as effective disclosure controls and procedures, complying with SEC rules and covering all our business operations. Any failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures covering our business could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, limit our ability to raise financing or lead to regulatory sanctions, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business or a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nDisruptions of our computer systems could adversely affect our operations\nWe rely heavily on computer systems to process transactions, manage our inventory and supply-chain and to summarize and analyze our business. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, or, if we do not replace or upgrade certain systems, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience an interruption of our normal business activities or loss of critical data. We are currently undertaking significant multi-year system enhancements and conversions to increase productivity and efficiency that require a substantial investment and dedication of resources, and if not done properly, could divert the attention of our workforce and constrain for some time our ability to provide the level of service our customers demand. Also, once implemented, the new systems and technology may not provide the intended efficiencies or anticipated benefits and could add costs and complications to our ongoing operations.\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our retail customers, our reputation could suffer and we could suffer financial harm\nThrough our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain personally identifiable information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on our website, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. This may include but is not limited to names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, contact preferences and payment account information, including credit and debit card information. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, such as information permitting cashless payments. The regulatory environment for information security is increasingly demanding, and our customers have a high expectation that we will protect their personal information. We have instituted safeguards for the protection of such information and our own proprietary information. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, burglaries, cyber attack, errors by employees or employees of third-parties, faulty password management, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularity, and result in\npersons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems and those of our vendors and unaffiliated third-parties are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or compromise. We may experience a breach of our systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data and integrity of our systems or prevent fraudulent purchases. If we experience a data security breach, we could be exposed to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, this could damage our reputation and our customers could lose confidence in us, which could cause them to stop using credit cards to purchase our products or stop shopping at our stores altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales, fines or lawsuits, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe risks of e-commerce retailing could hurt our results of operations\nBusiness risks related to our Perfumania.com e-commerce business include our ability to keep pace with rapid technological change, any failure in our or any third-party processor\u2019s security procedures and operational controls, failure or inadequacy in our or any third-party processor\u2019s systems or ability to process customer orders, and any significant or unanticipated increase in shipping costs, reduction in service, or slow-down in delivery by our third-party shipping vendors. If any of these risks materializes, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, specifically trademarks and trade names, our ability to compete would be negatively affected\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and trade names. We own, or have licenses or other rights to use, the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the United States and in other countries where such products are principally sold; therefore, trademark and trade name protection is very important to our business. Although most of our brand names are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, especially in the product class that includes fragrance products. The costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial.\nIf other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights that we license, the value of our brands in the marketplace may be diluted. Any infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of our time and resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise. Additionally, we may infringe or be accused of infringing on others\u2019 intellectual property rights and one or more adverse judgments with respect to these intellectual property rights could negatively impact our ability to compete and could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may experience impairment of the goodwill or value of long-lived assets that resulted from the Parlux acquisition\nIn connection with the Parlux acquisition, we recorded a substantial amount of goodwill in our financial statements and also acquired long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition or development of license brands and sublicensing opportunities. Both goodwill and the value of these long-lived assets can become impaired, as indicated by factors such as changes in our stock price, book value or market capitalization, and the past and anticipated operating performance and cash flows of our retail and wholesale segments. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, but the fair value estimates involved require a significant amount of difficult judgment and assumptions by management. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections, which may result in the need to recognize impairment of some or all of the goodwill we recorded and/or to write down the value of our long-lived assets, including brand licenses and trademarks.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our fragrance and related products\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality and safety of our fragrance and related products. If our products are found to be unsafe or defective, or if they otherwise fail to meet customers or consumers\u2019 standards and expectations, our reputation could be adversely affected, our relationships with customers or consumers could suffer, the appeal of one or more of our brands could be diminished, our sales could be adversely affected and/or we may become subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations\nWe operate on a global basis. The Company's products are sold in approximately 90 countries through a network of international distributors. Our international operations could be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\nchanges in economic, social, legal and other conditions, including, without limitation, the continuing turmoil in the Eurozone;\n\u2022the volatility of the U.S. dollar against other currencies;\n\u2022\ngeo-political conditions, such as terrorist attacks, war or other military action, public health problems and natural disasters;\n\u2022import and export license requirements;\n\u2022trade restrictions;\n\u2022changes in tariffs and taxes;\n\u2022product registration, permitting and regulatory compliance;\n\u2022restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the United States;\n\u2022the imposition of foreign and domestic governmental controls;\n\u2022changes in, or our unfamiliarity with, foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights.\nReductions in worldwide travel could hurt sales volumes in our duty-free related business\nWe depend on consumer travel for sales to our \u201cduty free\u201d customers in airports and other locations throughout the world. Any reductions in travel, including as a result of general economic downturns, natural disasters, or acts of war or terrorism, or disease epidemics, could result in a material decline in sales and profitability for this channel of distribution, which could negatively affect our operating results, financial condition, and operating cash flow.\nControl of our management and policies is with our principal shareholders, who could take actions that are not in the best interest of the other shareholders\nMembers of the Nussdorf family beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 57% of our outstanding common stock, assuming exercise of warrants they hold. As a result, if they acted together, they would be able to direct our corporate policies and could act unilaterally to approve most actions requiring shareholder approval under law or our governing documents. The Nussdorfs\u2019 collective stock ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing policies or actions deemed desirable by our Board of Directors, such as a business combination that might be in the interests of our other shareholders, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Conversely, such ownership may cause us to implement policies that are not in the best interests of our other shareholders.\nWe also have a material amount of indebtedness to the Nussdorfs and their affiliates. As significant creditors, the Nussdorfs may refuse consent to actions our Board may consider necessary.\nFurthermore, we have agreed that, in certain circumstances, we will register with the SEC the resale of certain shares of our common stock held by the Nussdorfs. They may require that, in the event of any marketing limitation on the number of shares included in an applicable registration statement, their shares be registered on a pro rata basis with shares being registered for parties that have obtained registration rights, in connection with providing financing to us. This may limit our ability to obtain financing in the future.", "PERMNO": 77186, "SIC": 5990, "TIC": "PERFQ"}
