{"cik": "1311596", "company": "Tobira Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in or incorporated by reference into this report, before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe are important to an investor may also harm our business operations. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or our results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of the value of any of our shares held by you.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have limited operating history, have incurred significant operating losses since inception and we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our clinical trial and development programs for cenicriviroc, or CVC, and other future product candidates. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $163.4 million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our clinical trials, research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash of $62.8 million. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development, clinical testing, regulatory compliance activities and, if CVC or other future product candidates is approved, sales and marketing activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in our incurring further significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently generate no revenue from product sales, and we may never be able to commercialize CVC or other future product candidates. We do not currently have the required regulatory approvals to market CVC or any other future product candidates, and we may never receive them. We may not be profitable even if we or any of our potential future development partners succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our product candidates, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nOur business depends on the success of CVC, which is still under development. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize CVC, our business will be materially harmed.\nCVC, a dual inhibitor of chemokine receptor type 2, or CCR2, and type 5, or CCR5, with anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects in liver disease models and antiviral effects on HIV has been the sole focus of our product development. Successful continued development and ultimate regulatory approval of CVC is critical to the future success of our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of CVC. We will need to raise sufficient funds for, and successfully enroll and complete, our ongoing clinical development program for CVC in NASH and PSC. The future regulatory and commercial success of this product candidate is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may not have sufficient financial and other resources to complete the necessary clinical trials for CVC;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to obtain adequate evidence of efficacy and safety for CVC in NASH, PSC, HIV or any other indication;\n\u00b7\nwe do not know the degree to which CVC will be accepted as a therapy, even if approved;\n\u00b7\nin our clinical programs, we may experience variability in patients, adjustments to clinical trial procedures and the need for additional clinical trial sites, which could delay our clinical trial progress;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory bodies for marketing approval;\n\u00b7\npatients in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to CVC, which could delay or prevent further clinical development;\n\u00b7\nthe standards implemented by clinical or regulatory agencies may change at any time;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies have not issued guidance on development standards or endpoints for commercial approval of drugs for NASH or PSC and, if issued in the future, that guidance may call for additional or different clinical trials or endpoints than those included in our program;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may require efficacy endpoints for a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of NASH or PSC that differ from the endpoints of our current or future trials, which may require us to conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe mechanism of action of CVC is complex and we do not know the degree to which it will translate into a medical benefit in NASH or PSC;\n\u00b7\nif approved for NASH or PSC, CVC will likely compete with the off-label use of currently marketed products and other therapies in development; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOf the large number of drugs in development in the pharmaceutical industry, only a small percentage result in the submission of applications for marketing authorization to regulatory authorities and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market CVC, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses or patient populations for which we may market the product. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our development programs, we cannot assure you that CVC will be successfully developed or commercialized. If we or any of our potential future development partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, successfully commercialize CVC, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nWe do not intend to progress CVC as an anti-retroviral therapy for HIV unless we raise significant non-dilutive financing and/or identify a strategic partner who will fund this program, which we might not achieve. We may not be able to secure such a strategic partner or non-dilutive financing.\nWe anticipate that future cash requirements to advance our HIV program will be significant and we only plan to advance it in collaboration with a strategic partner or with non-dilutive financing. If we are not able to collaborate with a strategic partner or secure non-dilutive financing, we may be unable to initiate further clinical studies for this program and may never be able to commercialize CVC in HIV. If we are unable to commercialize CVC in HIV or if we experience significant delays in advancing the program, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results. Any product candidate we or any of our future development partners advance into clinical trials, including CVC, may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\nDrug development has inherent risk. We or any of our potential future development partners will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Clinical studies are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. Delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials. In addition, success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful, because later-stage clinical trials may be conducted in broader patient populations and involve different study designs. Furthermore, our future trials will need to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in larger patient populations for approval by regulatory authorities. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. In addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of applications for marketing authorization to regulatory authorities and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nWe cannot be certain that any of our ongoing or future clinical trials will be successful, and any safety concerns observed in any one of our clinical trials in our targeted indications could limit the prospects for regulatory approval of our product candidates in those and other indications.\nBecause CVC has not yet received regulatory approval, it is difficult to predict the time and cost of development and our ability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for commercialization.\nCVC has not yet received regulatory approval and unexpected problems may arise that can cause us to delay, suspend or terminate our development efforts. Further, CVC has not yet demonstrated efficacy in humans for NASH or PSC, and the long-term safety consequences of dual inhibition of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors is not known. Regulatory approval of new product candidates such as CVC can be more expensive and take longer than approval for candidates for the treatment of more well understood diseases with previously approved products. While we have received Fast Track designation for CVC for the treatment of NASH in patients with liver fibrosis, we may not benefit from any accelerated timelines or other regulatory benefits from this designation.\nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, our ongoing and planned clinical trials could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.\nIn order to continue development of CVC, we will need to submit the results of clinical and preclinical testing to the FDA and other regulatory bodies, along with other information including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical results and potential clinical trial protocols. We may rely in part on preclinical, clinical and quality data generated by contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties for regulatory submissions for our product candidates. If these third parties do not provide us with data in a timely manner, we will not be able to make timely regulatory submissions for our product candidates, which may delay our plans for our clinical trials and potential product approvals. Furthermore, if those third parties do not make this data available to us, we will likely have to develop all necessary preclinical and clinical data on our own, which will lead to significant delays and increase development costs of the product candidate. Delays in the commencement or completion of our ongoing or future clinical trials for CVC or other future product candidates could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether our current or planned trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u00b7\nregulatory agencies failing to grant permission to proceed or placing the clinical trial on hold;\n\u00b7\nsubjects failing to enroll or remain in our trial at the rate we expect;\n\u00b7\nsubjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indication for which we are developing the product candidates, or participating in competing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nsubjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u00b7\na facility manufacturing our product candidate or any of its components being ordered by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently suspend operations due to violations of current good manufacturing practices, or GMP, regulations, or other applicable requirements;\n\u00b7\nany changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u00b7\nthird party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, GMP regulations or other regulatory requirements, or our CROs or other third parties not performing data collection or analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u00b7\ninspections of clinical trial sites by regulatory authorities or the finding of regulatory violations by regulatory authorities or an institutional review board, or IRB, that require us to undertake corrective action, that results in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of a clinical hold on the entire trial or that prohibits us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u00b7\nthird party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications; or\n\u00b7\none or more IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects or withdrawing its approval of the trial.\nProduct development costs will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of CVC or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the cost, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of our clinical trials, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, IRBs, other reviewing entities or any of our clinical trial sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for a product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Further, if one or more clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of CVC or other future product candidates could be significantly reduced.\nWe have not yet determined the details of any potential Phase 3 trial designs, including identification of a primary endpoint that the FDA or other regulatory authorities would deem acceptable in a study for the treatment of NASH or PSC. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities determine that Phase 3 studies would require substantially different endpoints than those addressed in our ongoing or future clinical trials, we may need to conduct additional Phase 2 clinical trials of CVC.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling and retaining patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nPatient enrollment and retention, both significant factors in the timing of clinical trials, are affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, patient willingness to undergo a liver biopsy in our NASH trials, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and disadvantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Potential patients for CVC may not be adequately diagnosed or identified with the diseases which we are targeting or may not meet the entry criteria for our studies.\nWe will be required to identify and enroll a sufficient number of patients with NASH or PSC for each of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of CVC in these indications, which we may fail to do. Also, we may encounter difficulties in identifying and enrolling NASH patients with a stage of disease appropriate for our ongoing or future clinical trials. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we are unable to locate a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials.\nAny product candidate in our current or future clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or have other properties that may delay or prevent its regulatory approval or commercialization or limit its commercial potential.\nUnacceptable adverse events observed in studies of our product candidates in current or future clinical trials could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This in turn could prevent us from completing development or commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenue from its sale. If any of our product candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product candidate.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, compliance with which is costly and time consuming, and such regulation may cause unanticipated delays in, or prevent the receipt of the required approvals for, commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable foreign regulatory agencies. We are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory bodies. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications and patient populations. Regulatory agencies may change their approval policies or regulations and have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval or testing of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.\nThe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our or any of our potential future development partners\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe or any of our potential future development partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u00b7\nthe results of clinical trials may not demonstrate the appropriateness of the dose or the safety or efficacy required by such authorities for approval;\n\u00b7\nwe or any of our potential future development partners may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may disagree with our interpretation or the quality of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third party manufacturers with which we or any of our potential future development partners contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u00b7\nthe approval policies or regulations of such authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our or any of our potential future development partners\u2019 clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us or any of our potential future development partners from commercializing our product candidates.\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for CVC and other future product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates.\nMarket acceptance and sales of CVC and other future product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement from third party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third party payor may depend upon a number of factors including the third party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product candidate is:\n\u00b7\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u00b7\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7\ncost-effective; and\n\u00b7\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product candidate from a government or other third party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of the applicable product candidate. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Further, reimbursement amounts may not support the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only in limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our product candidates profitably, or at all, even if approved.\nThird party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also refuse to provide coverage of approved product candidates for medical indications other than those for which regulatory authorities have granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn may put pressure on the pricing of drugs or force prescribers to use generic drugs. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates, if approved, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals as well as country, regional or local healthcare budget limitations.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for CVC or any other product candidate, it could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and will be subject to post-marketing requirements, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time consuming post-approval studies, post-market surveillance or clinical trials. Following approval, if any, of CVC or any other product candidate, such candidate will also be subject to ongoing FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agency requirements governing labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, reporting of safety and other post-market information, import and export. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with GMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a\nproduct, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requesting a recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we or the manufacturing facilities for CVC, or any other product candidate that may receive regulatory approval, if any, fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements or any subsequent applications or supplements we may file;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products or request us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue.\nThe FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as part of a NDA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of a drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry.\nIn addition, if CVC or any other future product candidate is approved, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for a product candidate, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. However, if we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we are deemed by the FDA to have engaged in the promotion of our products for off-label use, we could be subject to FDA prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products or significant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for CVC or any other product candidate, we still may not be able to successfully commercialize it, and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, could be limited.\nEven if CVC or any other future product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors or the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third party payors, including government payors, is also generally necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndemonstration of clinical efficacy and safety compared to other products;\n\u00b7\nthe limitation of our targeted patient population and other limitations or warnings contained in any approved product labeling;\n\u00b7\nacceptance of a new formulation by healthcare providers and their patients;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u00b7\nnew procedures or methods of treatment that may be more effective in treating or may reduce the incidences of NASH or other conditions for which our products are intended to treat;\n\u00b7\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third party coverage or reimbursement from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third party payors;\n\u00b7\nunfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate; and\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third party coverage.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors or patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from that product candidate and may not become or remain profitable. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third party payors on the benefits of CVC or any other future product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. In addition, our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidate will depend on our ability to manufacture our products, differentiate our products from competing products and defend and enforce our intellectual property rights relating to our products.\nIf the market opportunity for CVC for the treatment of NASH or PSC is smaller than we believe, our future revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nIf the size of the market opportunity for CVC in NASH or PSC is smaller than we anticipate, we may not be able to achieve profitability and growth. While we are initially targeting CVC for the treatment of NASH, a disease we believe to be one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases worldwide, our projections of the number of people who have NASH, as well as the subset of people with the disease who have the potential to benefit from treatment with CVC, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations and market research and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of this disease. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. The effort to identify patients with the diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. For example, NASH is often undiagnosed and may be left undiagnosed for a long time. A definitive diagnosis of NASH is currently based on a histological assessment of a liver biopsy, which impacts the ability to easily identify patients. If improved diagnostic techniques for identifying NASH patients who will benefit from treatment are not developed, our market opportunity may be smaller than we currently anticipate. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with CVC, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. PSC is a rare disease and, therefore, may have a limited market opportunity. Our estimates of the number of patients impacted by PSC may be incorrect and the market opportunity may be smaller than expected.\nIf we fail to develop and commercialize other product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business.\nAlthough the development and commercialization of CVC is our primary focus, as part of our longer-term growth strategy, we plan to evaluate the development and commercialization of other therapies related to immune-mediated, inflammatory, orphan and other diseases. We will evaluate internal opportunities and also may choose to in-license or acquire other product candidates as well as commercial products to treat patients suffering from immune-mediated or orphan or other disorders with high unmet medical needs and limited treatment options. These other product candidates will require additional, time-consuming development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, clinical trials and approval by the FDA and/or applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace or be more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet our deadlines and budget or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe are dependent on third parties to conduct all of our clinical trials. Accordingly, the timing of the initiation and completion of these trials is controlled by such third parties and may occur at times substantially different from our estimates. Specifically, we use CROs to conduct our clinical trials and rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, CROs and consultants to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and regulatory requirements. Our CROs, investigators, and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and subsequent collection and analysis of data.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators, or other third parties on which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required or within the estimated budget. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines, fails to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise performs in a\nsubstandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of these third parties do not complete their contracted activities or have delays or unexpected costs, we may incur significant additional costs to complete our clinical studies. If any of our clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on subjects enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer those subjects to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or if we fail to adequately disclose such compensation pursuant to FDA regulations, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.\nWe also regularly allow independent clinical investigators to conduct studies with our products that may not be completely under our control. Such investigator initiated studies may be conducted in a manner that results in unexpected data or events that are damaging to the value of our programs.\nWe rely on third parties to supply the components of and manufacture CVC for our clinical trials and commercialization, which is a complex process. Our dependence on third parties could adversely impact our business.\nWe are dependent on third-parties to supply the components of and manufacture CVC. If these third party suppliers do not supply sufficient quantities of materials to us on a timely basis and in accordance with applicable specifications, GMP regulations and other regulatory requirements, there could be a significant interruption of our supplies, which would adversely affect clinical development of the product candidate. Furthermore, if any of our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and within regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval, if any, for our product candidates.\nWe will also rely on our contract manufacturers to purchase from third party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our anticipated clinical trials. We have limited control over the process or timing of the acquisition of raw materials by our contract manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have agreements in place for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of that clinical trial, product candidate testing and potential regulatory approval of that product candidate.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to internally commercially manufacture CVC or any other future product candidates, if approved, and will likely continue to be dependent on third party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply us with clinical trial materials and any approved product candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis.\nThe process of drug manufacturing is complex, highly regulated and subject to several risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe manufacturing of compounds is complex, and only a limited number of manufacturers will be capable of manufacturing CVC and other future product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe manufacturing of compounds is susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination;\n\u00b7\nthe manufacturing facilities in which CVC and other future product candidates are made could be adversely affected by labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors; and\n\u00b7\nwe and our contract manufacturers must comply with GMP regulations and guidelines. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our product candidates are manufactured in accordance with GMP regulations and guidance, we are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers. We and our contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. We and our contract manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to follow GMP or other regulatory requirements or any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to comply with regulatory requirements or pass any regulatory authority inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, including leading to significant delays in the availability of product candidates for our clinical studies or the termination or hold on a clinical study or the delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of sanctions, including warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approvals for our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could be costly and damage our reputation. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.\nAny adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining strategic partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nWe may choose to enter into development or other strategic partnerships in the future, including collaborations with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. The negotiation process for collaborations is time consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish a development partnership or other alternative arrangements for any of our product candidates and programs. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish development partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such development partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product candidate are disappointing. Any delay in entering into development partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness if they reach the market.\nIn addition, our strategic partners may terminate any agreements they enter into with us, and we may not be able to adequately protect our rights under these agreements. Furthermore, our strategic partners will likely negotiate for certain rights to control decisions regarding the development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, and may not conduct those activities in the same manner as we do.\nMoreover, if we fail to maintain development or other strategic partnerships related to our product candidates that we may choose to enter into, then:\n\u00b7\nthe development of certain of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed;\n\u00b7\nour cash expenditures related to development of certain of our current or future product candidates would increase significantly, and we may need to seek additional financing;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted; and\n\u00b7\nwe will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates.\nWe may form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances.\nWe may form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business, including for the continued development or commercialization of CVC or other future product candidates. These relationships or those like them may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justifies such transaction.\nWe have discontinued our investment in the aptamer program and we have transferred the related intellectual property to Duke University, or Duke, and may never realize any benefit from this program.\nWe have discontinued investment in our aptamer program and transferred all related intellectual property to Duke University. While our agreement with Duke provides for potential licensing payments to Tobira, realization of any benefit from this agreement is unlikely given the early stage of the program. In addition, we have no involvement or control in the ongoing development of the aptamer program and no assurances that any efforts will be made to advance the program.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for the target indications of our product candidates that are approved more quickly than ours, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with established therapies as well as with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product candidate development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, universities and private and public research institutes may be active in research in our target indications, and they or their licensees could be in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, registering subjects for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additionally, we may face competition from developing countries, where costs may be cheaper.\nNew developments, including the development of other pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Competition in drug development is intense. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available.\nThere are currently no therapeutic products approved for the treatment of NASH. There are several commercially available products that are currently used off label for NASH, such as vitamin E (an antioxidant), diabetes medications (such as pioglitazone), antihyperlipidemic agents (such as gemfibrozil), pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid and others. In addition, there are numerous drugs in development for the treatment of NASH. We are aware of several companies with development programs targeting NASH in clinical trials including Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Cempra, Inc., Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc., Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Medical Research Ltd., Genfit Corp., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Immuron Ltd., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Nimbus Therapeutics Inc, Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk A/S, NuSirt Biopharma, Inc., Shire plc, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, Viking Therapeutics, Inc. and Zydus Cadilla. Many of the agents in development target metabolic mechanisms in NASH, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, or PPAR, agonists and farnesoid X, or FXR, receptor agonists. Other agents in development target fibrosis, such as targeting the collagen cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase-like 2, or LOXL2. We are not aware of a competitor with an active development program for NASH targeting CCR2/CCR5 inhibition.\nThere are currently no therapeutic products approved for the treatment of PSC. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the most studied therapy for PSC. Although several studies have shown that there is improvement in liver biochemistries, there is a long history of inconclusive trials failing to demonstrate positive clinical outcomes or increased transplant-free survival compared to placebo. In addition, there are drugs in development for the treatment of PSC. We are aware of several companies with development programs targeting PSC in clinical trials, including Acorda Therapeutics, Inc./Biotie Therapies Corp., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Shire plc.\nWe are aware of several companies that market therapies in HIV, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Gilead Sciences Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. and ViiV Healthcare. Other companies are also developing novel HIV therapies and vaccines.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, the availability and price of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand or the price we are able to charge, for our product candidates. Several generic products are already available and more will become available for the indications we are targeting with our product candidates. Our business will be harmed if the acceptance of our product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug products or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances. Our inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drug products would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe have no sales, marketing, reimbursement or distribution capabilities, and we will have to invest significant resources to develop these capabilities.\nWe have no internal sales, marketing, reimbursement or distribution capabilities. If CVC or any other future product candidates ultimately receives regulatory approval, we may not be able to effectively market and distribute the product candidate. We will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources to develop internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that CVC or any other future product candidates will be approved, if at all. We may not be able to hire consultants or external service providers to assist us in sales, marketing, reimbursement and distribution functions on acceptable financial terms or at all. Even if we decide to establish sales, marketing, reimbursement and distribution functions, we could face a number of additional related risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to attract and build an effective marketing department or sales force;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of establishing a marketing department or sales force may exceed our available financial resources or may exceed our expectations of the required staffing level or cost and the revenues generated by CVC or any other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire; and\n\u00b7\nour direct sales, reimbursement and marketing efforts may not be successful.\nIf we lose key scientists or management personnel, or if we fail to recruit additional highly skilled personnel, our ability to identify, develop and commercialize products will be impaired.\nWe are highly dependent on principal members of our management team and scientific staff, including our Chief Executive Officer, Laurent Fischer, M.D., and our Chief Medical Officer, \u00c9ric Lefebvre, M.D. These executives each have significant pharmaceutical industry experience. The loss of any member of our management team or scientific staff, including Drs. Fischer and Lefebvre, would impair our ability to identify, develop and market new products. Our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of these or other key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays to development or approval, loss of sales and diversion of management resources. In addition, we depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy. We may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis, if at all, which would negatively impact our development and commercialization programs.\nAdditionally, we do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees. This lack of insurance means that we may not receive adequate compensation for the loss of the services of these individuals.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs of February 26, 2016, we had 19 full-time employees. We will need to grow our organization substantially to continue development and pursue the potential commercialization of CVC and other future product candidates, as well as function as a public company. As we seek to advance CVC and other product candidates, we will need to expand our financial, development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management and require us to retain additional internal capabilities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, clinical and regulatory, financial, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to so accomplish could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and may affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding healthcare systems that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA or other agency regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly with a new Part D program. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formulas where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Notwithstanding the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, there is pressure to contain and reduce costs.\nMore recently, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, which is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act, among other things:\n\u00b7\nimposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell \u201cbranded prescription drugs\u201d;\n\u00b7\nincreased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;\n\u00b7\nexpanded the 340B drug discount program;\n\u00b7\nrequired collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u00b7\nrevised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for Medicaid drug rebate reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates due to states;\n\u00b7\nrequired manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and\n\u00b7\nmandated a further shift in the burden of Medicaid payments to the states.\nAlthough it is too early to determine the full effect of the Affordable Care Act on our business, the law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under Medicare, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers, managed care organizations, and prescription drug plan sponsors, of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013.\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u00b7\nthe demand for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u00b7\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of capital.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCertain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy laws and regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nthe federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formula managers on the other;\n\u00b7\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers.\nAlthough there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. We have consulting arrangements with physicians who provide various services to us. Payment for some of these consulting services is not made on a per-hour basis. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.\nRecent legislation has strengthened the above laws. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nThe Affordable Care Act also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on drug manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. In addition, drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nGovernments may impose price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product candidates. In many foreign countries the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of CVC or other future product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of potential product liability as a result of the clinical testing of CVC and other future product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize our product candidates. For example, we may be sued if CVC or our other product candidates allegedly cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease the commercialization of our product candidates. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for CVC or our other product candidates;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize CVC or our other product candidates; and\n\u00b7\na decline in our stock price.\nWe maintain clinical trial insurance with $10.0 million in coverage in the United States and local policies in other countries of various amounts based on local requirements, which we believe is sufficient to cover foreseeable claims that may be made against us and is customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we cannot be certain that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all claims that may be made against us and any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Furthermore, our inability to obtain and retain sufficient clinical trial insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of CVC or our other product candidates.\nOur term loan with Oxford contains restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nIn June 2014, and as amended in May 2015 and August 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the term loan are secured by all of our existing and future assets, excluding intellectual property unless otherwise determined by applicable judicial authority. The agreement contains various covenants that require Oxford\u2019s approval to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants require approval to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur or assume certain debt;\n\u00b7\nmerge or consolidate;\n\u00b7\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u00b7\ndispose of certain assets;\n\u00b7\ngrant liens on our assets including our intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments;\n\u00b7\npay dividends; and\n\u00b7\nenter into material transactions with affiliates.\nA breach of any of these covenants or a material adverse change to our business could result in a default under the loan. In the case of an event of default under the loan, Oxford could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, commence and prosecute bankruptcy and/or other insolvency proceedings, or proceed against the collateral granted to Oxford as security for the loan.\nWe and any of our future development partners will be required to report to regulatory authorities if any approved products cause or contribute to adverse events, and any failure to do so would result in sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we and any of our future development partners are successful in commercializing our products, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities would require that we and any of our future development partners report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We and any of our future development partners may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe or we may fail to receive notice of such events from our CROs within the prescribed time period. We and any of our future development partners may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we and any of our future development partners fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority could take action, including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products or delay in approval of future products.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our development partners, third party CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors, consultants and collaborators are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidate could be delayed. We plan to update the financial systems technology associated with our general ledger accounting in 2016. Should the new systems not be implemented successfully, or if the systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner once the update is complete, our business and operations could be adversely affected.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third party manufacturers to produce CVC and our other product candidates. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of CVC or our other product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected similarly.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates are subject in part to the terms and conditions of a license to CVC granted to us by Takeda.\nCVC is based in part on patents that we have licensed on an exclusive basis and other intellectual property licensed from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. Takeda holds certain rights with respect to CVC in the license agreement. This license imposes various commercial, contingent payment, royalty, insurance, indemnification, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would lose valuable rights under our collaboration agreements and our ability to develop product candidates.\nEither party may terminate the license agreement under certain circumstances, including a material breach of the agreement by the other. In the event we terminate our license, or if Takeda terminates our license due to our breach, all rights to CVC, including any intellectual property we develop with respect to CVC or licensed or developed by us under this agreement will revert or otherwise be licensed back to Takeda on an exclusive basis. Any termination or reversion to Takeda of our rights to develop or commercialize CVC, including any reacquisition by Takeda of our rights, will have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may fail to comply with any of our obligations under existing agreements pursuant to which we license rights or technology, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business.\nWe are a party to a license agreement with Takeda that is important to our business, and we may enter into additional licenses in the future. Under our agreement from Takeda, Takeda has assigned and licensed to us certain patents and know-how relating to CVC. This license agreement imposes various commercial, contingent payment, royalty, insurance, indemnification, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, Takeda may have the right to terminate the license agreement, in which event we would lose valuable rights to CVC and would be unable to develop or market CVC.\nWith respect to certain patents under our license agreement with Takeda and in some cases with respect to any license we may enter into in the future, patent prosecution of our licensed technology is controlled solely by the licensor. If our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property we license from them, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market competing products using the intellectual property. In certain cases, including with respect to the patents assigned to us from Takeda, we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed or assigned technology. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur significant liability to our licensing partners. Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business, and scientific issues. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u00b7\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights;\n\u00b7\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u00b7\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our collaborators; and\n\u00b7\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over intellectual property and other rights that we have licensed or acquired from third parties prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, proprietary technologies, and their uses as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We can provide no assurance that our patent applications or those of our licensors will result in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technology, nor can there be any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around or invalidated by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. This failure to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nComposition-of-matter patents on the biological or chemical active pharmaceutical ingredient are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property and provide the broadest scope of patent protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. While we have issued composition-of-matter patents in the United States and other countries for CVC, we cannot be certain that the claims in our issued composition-of-matter patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. We cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition-of-matter or formulations of our other product candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our issued composition-of-matter patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. Even if our patent applications covering formulations of our product candidates issue as patents, the formulation patents protect a specific formulation of a product and may not be enforced against competitors making and marketing a product that has the same active pharmaceutical ingredient in a different formulation. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method or for treatment of a particular indication. This type of patent may not be enforced against competitors making and marketing a product that has the same active pharmaceutical ingredient but used for a method not included in the patent. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \u201coff-label.\u201d Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nOur issued composition of matter patents for CVC are expected to expire in the United States as early as 2023. Our additional patents and pending patent applications that cover formulations, combination products and use of CVC to treat various indications are expected to expire at various times that range from 2023 (for issued patents) to potentially 2036 (for currently-filed provisional patent applications if patents were to issue on non-provisional applications filed thereon).\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case;\n\u00b7\npatent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u00b7\npatents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u00b7\nour competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthere may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns;\n\u00b7\ncountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing product candidates; and\n\u00b7\ncompanies may also disregard intellectual property rights and manufacture counterfeit products that could reduce sales of our products.\nIn addition, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and third parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information independently. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating our trade secrets. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, our business may be harmed.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a \u2018\u2018first inventor to file\u2019\u2019 system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO, in which case a patent may become subject to post-grant proceedings including opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope or enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nClaims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nThe biotechnology industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. Because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of CVC or our other product candidates. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently-pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, identification of third party patent rights that may be relevant to our technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time consuming and could likely:\n\u00b7\nresult in costly litigation;\n\u00b7\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u00b7\ncause development delays;\n\u00b7\nprevent us from commercializing CVC or our other product candidates until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis; or\n\u00b7\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nAlthough no third party has asserted a claim of patent infringement against us as of the filing date of this report, others may hold proprietary rights that could prevent CVC or our other product candidates from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our product candidate or processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market CVC or our other product candidates. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we could redesign our product candidate or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing CVC or our other product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or in addition to interference proceedings, may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or other post-grant proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful. Further, our issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nIf we or any of our future development partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent directed at one of our product candidates, or one of our future product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or insufficient written description. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur vendors or employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of vendor or employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by vendor or employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA and other regulatory authority regulations, provide accurate information to these regulatory authorities, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, disclose unauthorized activities to us, or comply with securities laws. Vendor or employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, including for illegal insider trading activities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter vendor or employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe currently have rights to the intellectual property, through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own, to develop our product candidates. Because our programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business\nmay depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license, or use these proprietary rights. For example, our product candidates may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and the rights to these formulations may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates. The licensing and acquisition of third party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment.\nWe may collaborate with U.S. and foreign academic institutions and industry collaborators to accelerate our preclinical or clinical research. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program.\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of that program and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we engage the services of consultants, in addition to our employees, to assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of these employees and consultants, and many of our employees, were previously employed at, or may have previously provided or may be currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that our company, our employees or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to research and develop and to manufacture our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of our third party collaborators. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments by extending the patent terms for CVC or our other product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of CVC or other product candidates, one or more of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWhile we have issued composition-of-matter patents directed at CVC in the United States and other countries, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on CVC and our other product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. For example, India and China have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. Although we currently do not have issued patents in these particular jurisdictions, to the extent we are able to obtain such patents, we may have limited remedies if our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully develop and commercialize CVC and other future product candidates.\nAlthough we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next 12 months, we will require substantial future capital in order to complete the remaining clinical development for CVC and our other product candidates and to potentially commercialize these product candidates. We expect our spending levels to increase in connection with our clinical trials of CVC, as well as other corporate activities. The amount and timing of any expenditure needed to implement our development and commercialization programs will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe type, number, scope, progress, expansion costs, results of and timing of our ongoing or future clinical trials or the need for additional clinical trials of CVC or any of our other product candidates which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of obtaining or maintaining manufacturing for CVC and any of our other product candidates, including commercial manufacturing if any product candidate is approved;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of establishing sales marketing, and reimbursement capabilities and enhanced internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, license agreements and other partnerships;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with any new product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with operating as a public company.\nSome of these factors are outside of our control. We do not expect our existing capital resources to be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates. We expect that we will need to raise additional funds in the future.\nWe have not sold any products, and we do not expect to sell or derive revenue from any product sales for the foreseeable future. We may seek additional funding through future debt and equity financing, as well as potential additional collaborations or strategic partnerships with other companies or through non-dilutive financings. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and covenants related to our term loan with Oxford may limit funding alternatives available to us. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. In addition, the issuance of additional shares by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we will be unable to complete ongoing and planned clinical trials for CVC and any of our other product candidates and we may be required to significantly curtail some or all of our activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates or some of our technologies or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $110.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively. The federal loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2020, and the state loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2016, unless previously utilized. The Company also had federal and California research and development credit carryforwards totaling $2.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The federal research and development credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033, unless previously utilized. The California research credits do not expire.\nThese net operating losses have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.\nWe are required to file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and various other state jurisdictions. The preparation of these income tax returns requires the Company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect which could affect the amount of tax paid to these jurisdictions.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in addition to global and industry-wide events:\n\u00b7\nthe losses we may incur;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;\n\u00b7\npublic concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and\n\u00b7\nlitigation.\nIn addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could materially decline.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders will have the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who beneficially owned more than 5% of our common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own shares representing approximately 71.1% of our common stock as estimated as of December 31, 2015. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, will control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other business combination or reorganization. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of us on terms that other stockholders may desire. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nclassifying our board of directors into three classes;\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d convertible preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u00b7\nrequiring a supermajority vote of stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\nestablishing Delaware as the exclusive jurisdiction for certain stockholder litigation against us.\nIn addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits, with some exceptions, stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions together provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nYour investment may be diluted by exercises of outstanding options and warrants.\nAs of February 26, 2016, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 3,284,327 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $12.23 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 64,657 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $11.72 per share. The exercise of such outstanding options and warrants will result in dilution of your investment. In addition, as described below, you may experience additional dilution if we issue common stock in the future. As a result of this dilution, you may receive significantly less than the full purchase price you paid for the shares in the event of liquidation.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our share price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. Such future sales may be through Cowen and Company, LLC and may be made in sales deemed to be at-the-market equity offerings as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as discussed in more detail in our Registration Statement on Form S-3, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 4, 2015. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ stock market, or NASDAQ, our common stock could be delisted and the price and liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur common stock may lose value and our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ due to several factors or a combination of such factors. While our common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing. To maintain the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. If our common stock trades below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for 30 consecutive business days or if we do not meet other listing requirements, we may be notified by NASDAQ of non-compliance. There can be no assurance that the per share trading price of our common stock will remain above $1.00 per share or that we will be able to continue to meet other listing requirements. If our common stock is delisted, market liquidity for our common stock could be severely affected, and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock could be limited. In addition, our common stock could be subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact our market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock. Accordingly, a delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ would negatively affect the value of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including, but not limited to, the loss of institutional investor interest.\nWe are incurring significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company and such costs are likely to increase particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are required to comply with certain of the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and NASDAQ, our stock exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial\ncontrols and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nHowever, for as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nUnder the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nAfter we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and will be able take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. When and if we are a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d or an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d and are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d each as defined in the Exchange Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of an exemption available to emerging growth companies from these auditor attestation requirements. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we will need to upgrade our systems including information technology; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we or, if required, our auditors are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the future. Our loan and security agreement with Oxford prohibits us from paying cash dividends. As a result, the only return to stockholders will be appreciation in the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nWe are now subject to and may in the future be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and may be volatile in the future, and in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to an increased incidence of securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. For example, in February 2015, two putative class action lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware against us and certain of our directors on alleging that certain of our directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Merger. For more information, see Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d.\nRisks Relating to the Merger\nThe integration of Tobira and Tobira Development will require significant resources and may not be successful.\nThere is limited history of Tobira (formerly known as Regado Biosciences, Inc.) and Tobira Development as a combined company. As a result, there can be no guarantee that the two companies will operate together successfully as a combined company. Integration of the companies and consolidation of their operations will require considerable management time, which could result in the diversion of management resources from other important matters.\nThe failure to successfully integrate the merged businesses in the expected timeframe could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future results.\nThe failure to successfully integrate and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company\u2019s failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u00b7\nusing the combined company\u2019s cash and other assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined company;\n\u00b7\nappropriately managing the liabilities of the combined company;\n\u00b7\npotential unknown or currently unquantifiable liabilities associated with the Merger and the operations of the combined company; and\n\u00b7\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nThe operations of the combined company may be adversely affected by the integration.\nThe combined company will be subject to various risks following the consummation of the Merger, including:\n\u00b7\ninterruption of the operations of the combined companies; and\n\u00b7\nanticipated and unanticipated costs relating to additional administrative or operating expenses of each business.\nThese and other factors could adversely affect the combined business and operating results.", "PERMNO": 14101, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "TBRA"}
