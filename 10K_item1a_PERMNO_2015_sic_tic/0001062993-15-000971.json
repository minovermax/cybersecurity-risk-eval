RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this report in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our company\u2019s common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have not generated any revenue from operations since our inception. We expect that our operating expenses will increase over the next twelve months to continue our development activities. We estimate our average monthly expenses over the next twelve months to be approximately $491,000, including general and administrative expenses and research and development. This amount could increase if we encounter difficulties that we cannot anticipate at this time. As of the date of this filing, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $485,284. We do not expect to raise capital through debt financing from traditional lending sources since we are not currently producing revenue and cannot assure a lender that we will be able to successfully achieve commercial revenues from the development of our technology. Therefore, we only expect to raise money through equity financing via the sale of our common stock. If we cannot raise the money that we need in order to continue to operate our business, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations. If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional financing, we may need to curtail, discontinue or cease operations.\nDuring 2014, we have received certain grant funding and have relied and expect to continue to rely on such funding to further our clinical development in the future.\nOn June 30, 2014, our U.S. Subsidiary entered into a grant agreement with Maryland Technology Development Corporation (\u201cTEDCO\u201d). TEDCO was created by the Maryland State Legislature in 1998 to facilitate the transfer and commercialization of technology from Maryland\u2019s research universities and federal labs into the marketplace and to assist in the creation and growth of technology-based businesses in all regions of the State. Under the agreement, TEDCO has agreed to give us an amount not to exceed $406,431 to be used solely to finance the costs to conduct the research project entitled \u201cAutologous Insulin Producing (AIP) Cells for Diabetes\u201d during a period of two years. On July 22, 2014, our U.S. Subsidiary received an advance payment of $203,215 on account of the grant. Through November 30, 2014, an amount of $118,305 out of the $203,215 was spent.\nOn November 17, 2014, our Belgian Subsidiary received the formal approval from the Walloon Region, Belgium (Service Public of Wallonia, DGO6) for a \u20ac2.015 million support program for the research and development of a potential cure for Type 1 Diabetes. The Financial support is composed of a 1,085,000 Euros (70% of budgeted costs) grant for the industrial research part of the research program and a further recoverable advance of 930,000 Euros (60% of budgeted costs) of the experimental development part of the research program. The grants will be paid to us over a period of approximately 3 years. The grants are subject to certain conditions with respect to our work in the Walloon Region, our own investment in these projects and certain other conditions. On December 9 and 16, 2014, we received \u20ac651,000 and \u20ac558,000 under the grant, respectively, to have relied on grant funding in 2014 may need to raise additional funds in the future that may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOn December 21, 2014, we received a notification from the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (\u201cBIRD\u201d) that our Israeli Subsidiary, and our research and development partner, have been approved by BIRD's Board of Governors for a conditional grant of $800,000 for a joint research and development project for the use Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) Cells for the Treatment of Diabetes (the \u201cProject\u201d). A Cooperation and Project Funding Agreement (CPFA) must be signed for the Project with the BIRD Foundation within three months, or by March 31, 2015. Up to the date of this report, we have not received these funds and may be unable to obtain these funds if we are not able to provide sufficient information to BIRD or if our CPFA is not accepted by such date.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future that may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund clinical trials, for potential acquisitions or investments, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, in which case, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe are an early-stage company with a limited operating history, which may hinder our ability to successfully meet our objectives.\nWe are an early-stage company with only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects. As a result, the revenue and income potential of our business is unproven. In addition, because of our limited operating history, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. Errors may be made in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, and we will be subject to the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in evolving markets. We may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks and uncertainties. Failure to adequately do so could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nBecause some of our directors and officers are not residents of the United States, investors may find it difficult to enforce, within the United States, any judgments obtained against some of our directors and officers.\nSome of our directors and officers are not residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against some of our directors and officers, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.\nIf we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nIn order to successfully implement and manage our business plan, we will depend upon, among other things, successfully recruiting and retaining qualified personnel having experience in the pharmaceutical industry. Competition for qualified individuals is intense. We may not be able to find, attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. If we are unable to find, attract and retain qualified personnel with technical expertise, our business operations could suffer.\nFuture growth could strain our resources, and if we are unable to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\nWe hope to experience rapid growth in our operations, which will place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively. This will require that we hire and train additional personnel to manage our expanding operations. In addition, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we may be unable to execute upon our business plan.\nRisks Relating to our Operations in Israel\nConditions in Israel and the surrounding Middle East may materially adversely affect our Subsidiaries\u2019 operations and personnel.\nOur Israeli Subsidiary has significant operations in Israel, including research and development. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts and terrorist acts have taken place, which in the past, and may in the future, lead to security and economic problems for Israel. In addition, certain countries in the Middle East adjacent to Israel, including Egypt and Syria, recently experienced, and some continue to experience, political unrest and instability marked by civil demonstrations and violence, which in some cases resulted in the replacement of governments and regimes. Current and future conflicts and political, economic and/or military conditions in Israel and the Middle East region may affect our operations in Israel. The exacerbation of violence within Israel or the outbreak of violent conflicts involving Israel may impede our Israeli Subsidiary\u2019s ability to engage in research and development, or otherwise adversely affect its business or operations. In addition, our Israeli Subsidiary\u2019s employees in Israel may be required to perform annual mandatory military service and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances. The absence of these employees may have an adverse effect on our Israeli Subsidiary\u2019s operations. Hostilities involving Israel may also result in the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe ability of our Israeli Subsidiary to pay dividends is subject to limitations under Israeli law and dividends paid and loans extended by our Israeli Subsidiary may be subject to taxes.\nThe ability of our Israeli Subsidiary to pay dividends is governed by Israeli law, which provides that dividends may be paid by an Israeli corporation only out of its earnings as defined in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law of 1999, provided that there is no reasonable concern that such payment will cause our Israeli Subsidiary to fail to meet its current and expected liabilities as they come due. Cash dividends paid by our Israeli Subsidiary to our company may result in our Israeli Subsidiary having to pay taxes on any dividends it declares.\nRisks Relating to the Biopharmaceutical Business\nOur Licensor may cancel the License Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the License Agreement with Tel Hashomer - Medical Research, Infrastructure and Services Ltd. (\u201cTHM\u201d), we must develop, manufacture, sell and market the products pursuant to the milestones and time schedule specified in the Development Plan. In the event we fail to fulfill the terms of the Development Plan, THM shall be entitled to terminate the License Agreement by providing us with written notice of such a breach and if we do not cure such breach within one year of receiving the notice. If THM cancels the License Agreement, our business may be materially adversely affected. THM may also terminate the License Agreement if we breach an obligation contained in the License Agreement and do not cure it within 180 days of receiving notice of the breach.\nIf we are unable to successfully acquire, develop or commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer.\nOur future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our technology and businesses in a timely manner. There are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new technologies and products, including:\nsuccessfully achieving major developmental steps required to bring the product to a clinical testing stage and clinical testing may not be positive;\ndeveloping, testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner;\nthe failure to receive requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner or at all;\ndeveloping and commercializing a new product is time consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors, including legal actions brought by our competitors, that may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product;\nincomplete, unconvincing or equivocal clinical trials data;\nexperiencing delays or unanticipated costs;\nsignificant and unpredictable changes in the payer landscape, coverage and reimbursement for our future product;\nexperiencing delays as a result of limited resources at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) or other regulatory agencies; and\nchanging review and approval policies and standards at the FDA and other regulatory agencies.\nAs a result of these and other difficulties, products in development by us may or may not receive timely regulatory approvals, or approvals at all, necessary for marketing by us or other third-party partners. If any of our future products are not approved in a timely fashion or, when acquired or developed and approved, cannot be successfully manufactured, commercialized or reimbursed, our operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing product will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing these products.\nOur expenditures may not result in commercially successful products.\nWe cannot be sure our business expenditures will result in the successful acquisition, development or launch of product that will prove to be commercially successful or will improve the long-term profitability of our business. If such business expenditures do not result in the successful acquisition, development or launch of a commercially successful line of products, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our future products.\nThe manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Litigation may be costly and time-consuming, and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, if we infringe on the rights of others, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture or market products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. As a result, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our future products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nExtensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\nAll pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. For the U.S., this is principally administered by the FDA and to a lesser extent by the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) and state government agencies, as well as by varying regulatory agencies in foreign countries where products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations, and similar foreign statutes and regulations, govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our future products.\nUnder these regulations, we may become subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our future products by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. In addition, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies conduct pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) and other regulations. Following such inspections, the FDA or other agency may issue observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of \u201cregulatory significance\u201d for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. We may also be required to report adverse events associated with our future products to FDA and other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns would result in labeling changes, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions.\nThe range of possible sanctions includes, among others, FDA issuance of adverse publicity, product recalls or seizures, fines, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA\u2019s review of product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions, and civil or criminal prosecution. Any such sanctions, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Similar sanctions as detailed above may be available to the FDA under a consent decree, depending upon the actual terms of such decree. If internal compliance programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could materially harm our business.\nFor Europe, the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMEA\u201d) will regulate our future products. Regulatory approval by the EMEA will be subject to the evaluation of data relating to the quality, efficacy and safety of our future products for its proposed use. The time taken to obtain regulatory approval varies between countries. Different regulators may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant, or may require additional data before granting, an approval, notwithstanding that regulatory approval may have been granted by other regulators. Regulatory approval may be delayed, limited or denied for a number of reasons, including insufficient clinical data, the product not meeting safety or efficacy requirements or any relevant manufacturing processes or facilities not meeting applicable requirements.\nFurther trials and other costly and time-consuming assessments of the product may be required to obtain or maintain regulatory approval. Medicinal products are generally subject to lengthy and rigorous pre-clinical and clinical trials and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by regulatory authorities. We may be required to conduct additional trials beyond those currently planned, which could require significant time and expense.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and our ability to generate revenue from product sales and become profitable depends significantly on our success in a number of factors.\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales, and do not anticipate generating any revenue from product sales until sometime after we have received regulatory approval for the commercial sale of a product candidate. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our success in many factors, including:\ncompleting research regarding, and nonclinical and clinical development of, our product candidates;\nobtaining regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for product candidates for which we complete clinical studies;\ndeveloping a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process for our product candidates, including establishing and maintaining commercially viable supply relationships with third parties and establishing our own manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure;\nlaunching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\nobtaining market acceptance of our product candidates as viable treatment options;\naddressing any competing technological and market developments;\nidentifying, assessing, acquiring and/or developing new product candidates;\nnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter;\nmaintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how; and\nattracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or other regulatory agencies, domestic or foreign, to change our manufacturing processes or assays, or to perform clinical, nonclinical, or other types of studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. If we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to get reimbursement at any price, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable disease patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, even if approved. If we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may never become profitable.\nWe have concentrated our research and development efforts on technology using cell-based therapy, and our future success is highly dependent on the successful development of that technology for Type 1 Diabetes.\nWe have developed a technology that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver and differentiating (converting) them into \u201cpancreatic beta cell-like\u201d insulin-producing cells for patients with Type 1 Diabetes. Based on licensed knowhow and patents, our intention is to develop our technology to the clinical stage for regeneration of functional insulin-producing cells, thus enabling normal glucose regulated insulin secretion, via cell therapy. By using therapeutic agents (i.e., PDX-1, and additional pancreatic transcription factors in an adenovirus-vector) that efficiently convert a sub-population of liver cells into pancreatic islets phenotype and function, this approach allows the diabetic patient to be the donor of his own therapeutic tissue and to start producing his/her own insulin in a glucose-responsive manner, thereby eliminating the need for insulin injections. Because this is a new approach to treating Type 1 Diabetes, developing and commercializing our product candidates subjects us to a number of challenges, including:\nobtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities that have very limited experience with the commercial development of our technology for diabetes;\ndeveloping and deploying consistent and reliable processes for engineering a patient\u2019s liver cells ex vivo and infusing the engineered cells back into the patient;\ndeveloping processes for the safe administration of these products, including long-term follow-up for all patients who receive our products;\nsourcing clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our products;\ndeveloping a manufacturing process and distribution network with a cost of goods that allows for an attractive return on investment; and\nestablishing sales and marketing capabilities after obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance;\nWhen we are able to commence our clinical trials, we may not be able to conduct our trials on the timelines we expect.\nClinical testing is expensive, time consuming, and subject to uncertainty. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. We expect that our early clinical work will help support the filing with the FDA of an IND for our product in the first half of 2015. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit an IND in this time-frame, and we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. Moreover, even if these trials begin, issues may arise that could suspend or terminate such clinical trials. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical studies may not be successful. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\nthe inability to generate sufficient preclinical or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of clinical studies;\ndelays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;\nthe FDA not allowing us to use the clinical trial data from a research institution to support an IND if we cannot demonstrate the comparability of our product candidates with the product candidate used by the relevant research institution in its clinical studies;\ndelays in obtaining required Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical study site;\nimposition of a temporary or permanent clinical hold by regulatory agencies for a number of reasons, including after review of an IND application or amendment, or equivalent application or amendment; as a result of a new safety finding that presents unreasonable risk to clinical trial participants; a negative finding from an inspection of our clinical study operations or study sites; developments on trials conducted by competitors for related technology that raises FDA concerns about risk to patients of the technology broadly; or if FDA finds that the investigational protocol or plan is clearly deficient to meet its stated objectives;\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our clinical studies;\ndifficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators;\nfailure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, requirements, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;\npatients dropping out of a study;\noccurrence of adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\nchanges in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials;\nthe cost of clinical studies of our product candidates being greater than we anticipate;\nclinical studies of our product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in our deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical studies or abandon product development programs; and\ndelays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating, or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical studies or the inability to do any of the foregoing.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may be required to or we may elect to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur clinical trial results may also not support approval, whether accelerated approval, conditional marketing authorizations, or regular approval. The results of preclinical and clinical studies may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. In addition, our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\nthe population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates\u2019 risk-benefit ratios for their proposed indications are acceptable;\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh their safety risks;\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, our own manufacturing facilities, or our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nFurther, failure to obtain approval for any of the above reasons may be made more likely by the fact that the FDA and other regulatory authorities have very limited experience with commercial development of our cell therapy for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences.\nAs with most biological drug products, use of our product candidates could be associated with side effects or adverse events which can vary in severity from minor reactions to death and in frequency from infrequent to prevalent. Any of these occurrences may materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nResearch and development of biopharmaceutical products is inherently risky.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and enhance our technology platform to create a pipeline of product candidates and develop commercially successful products, or we may expend our limited resources on programs that do not yield a successful product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates or diseases that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. If we fail to develop additional product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be limited. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, obtaining regulatory approvals and commercializing additional product candidates will require substantial additional funding beyond the net proceeds of this offering and are prone to the risks of failure inherent in medical product development. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development involves significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval, and become commercially viable. We cannot provide you any assurance that we will be able to successfully advance any of these additional product candidates through the development process. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development or commercialization for many reasons, including the following:\nour platform may not be successful in identifying additional product candidates;\nwe may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\nour product candidates may not succeed in preclinical or clinical testing;\na product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\nthe market for a product candidate may change during our program so that the continued development of that product candidate is no longer reasonable;\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third- party payers, if applicable.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, discover, develop, or commercialize additional product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nOur product candidates are biologics and the manufacture of our product candidates is complex and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process development or scaling-out of our manufacturing capabilities.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure. Our product candidates are biologics and the process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to multiple risks. The manufacture of our product candidates involves complex processes, including the biopsy of tissue from a patient\u2019s liver, propagation of the patient\u2019s liver cells from that liver tissue to obtain the desired dose, trans-differentiating those cells into insulin-producing cells ex vivo and ultimately infusing the cells back into a patient\u2019s body. As a result of the complexities, the cost to manufacture biologics is generally higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds, and the manufacturing process is less reliable and is more difficult to reproduce. Our manufacturing process will be susceptible to product loss or failure due to logistical issues associated with the collection of liver cells, or starting material, from the patient, shipping such material to the manufacturing site, shipping the final product back to the patient, and infusing the patient with the product, manufacturing issues associated with the differences in patient starting materials, interruptions in the manufacturing process, contamination, equipment or reagent failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in cell growth, and variability in product characteristics. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects, and other supply disruptions. If for any reason we lose a patient\u2019s starting material or later-developed product at any point in the process, the manufacturing process for that patient will need to be restarted and the resulting delay may adversely affect that patient\u2019s outcome. If microbial, viral, or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Because our product candidates are manufactured for each particular patient, we will be required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to materials as they move from the patient to the manufacturing facility, through the manufacturing process, and back to the patient. Maintaining such a chain of identity is difficult and complex, and failure to do so could result in adverse patient outcomes, loss of product, or regulatory action including withdrawal of our products from the market. Further, as product candidates are developed through preclinical to late stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials.\nAlthough we are working to develop commercially viable processes, doing so is a difficult and uncertain task, and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or commercialization, including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-out, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency, and timely availability of reagents or raw materials. We may ultimately be unable to reduce the cost of goods for our product candidates to levels that will allow for an attractive return on investment if and when those product candidates are commercialized.\nWe expect our manufacturing strategy will involve the use of one or more CMOs as well as establishing our own capabilities and infrastructure, including a manufacturing facility. We expect that development of our own manufacturing facility will provide us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and allow for better long-term margins. However, we have no experience as a company in developing a manufacturing facility and may never be successful in developing our own manufacturing facility or capability. We may establish multiple manufacturing facilities as we expand our commercial footprint to multiple geographies, which may lead to regulatory delays or prove costly. Even if we are successful, our manufacturing capabilities could be affected by cost-overruns, unexpected delays, equipment failures, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of our manufacturing strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, the manufacturing process for any products that we may develop is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval process, and we will need to contract with manufacturers who can meet all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. If we or our CMOs are unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we need to commercialize such products. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that either we or our CMOs will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product, or to meet potential future demand. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidate, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to manufacture our clinical product supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties for at least a portion of the manufacturing process of our product candidates, if approved. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently own any facility that may be used as our clinical-scale manufacturing and processing facility and must currently rely on outside vendors to manufacture supplies and process our product candidates, which is and will need to be done on a patient-by-patient basis. We have not yet caused our product candidates to be manufactured or processed on a commercial scale and may not be able to do so for any of our product candidates.\nOn July 3, 2014, our Belgian Subsidiary entered into a service agreement with MaSTherCell, pursuant to which MaSTherCell will function as our CMO and conduct certain clinical tests related to diabetes treatment research. The term of the service agreement will run until all work is completed (or by either party providing 30 days\u2019 written notice of termination) in order to develop a manufacturing process and to manufacture our product. While we anticipate that MaSTherCell will be able to sufficiently support our needs as a CMO, we may need to find other CMOs to meet our clinical and manufacturing needs, of which there are a limited number of third-party manufacturers. This exposes us to the following risks:\nWe may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any manufacturers. This approval would require new testing and good manufacturing practices compliance inspections by FDA. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products;\nOther manufacturers may have little or no experience with autologous cell products, which are products made from a patient\u2019s own cells, and therefore may require a significant amount of support from us in order to implement and maintain the infrastructure and processes required to manufacture our product candidates;\nOur third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely manufacture our product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any;\nContract manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures and other logistical support requirements appropriately;\nOur future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed, may not devote sufficient resources to our products, or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store, and distribute our products;\nManufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards;\nWe may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our products;\nOur third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreement with us;\nRaw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier, may not be available or may not be suitable or acceptable for use due to material or component defects;\nOur contract manufacturers and critical reagent suppliers may be subject to inclement weather, as well as natural or man-made disasters; or\nOur contract manufacturers may have unacceptable or inconsistent product quality success rates and yields.\nEach of these risks could delay or prevent the completion of our clinical trials or the approval of any of our product candidates by the FDA, result in higher costs or adversely impact commercialization of our product candidates. In addition, we will rely on third parties to perform certain specification tests on our product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately done and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm and the FDA could place significant restrictions on our company until deficiencies are remedied.\nThe manufacture of biological drug products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of biologic products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up or out, validating the production process, and assuring high reliability of the manufacturing process (including the absence of contamination). These problems include logistics and shipping, difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, product testing, operator error, availability of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot assure you that any stability failures or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide our product candidate to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to begin new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely.\nCell-based therapies rely on the availability of reagents, specialized equipment, and other specialty materials, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. For some of these reagents, equipment, and materials, we rely or may rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors, which could impair our ability to manufacture and supply our products.\nManufacturing our product candidates will require many reagents, which are substances used in our manufacturing processes to bring about chemical or biological reactions, and other specialty materials and equipment, some of which are manufactured or supplied by small companies with limited resources and experience to support commercial biologics production. We currently depend on a limited number of vendors for certain materials and equipment used in the manufacture of our product candidates. Some of these suppliers may not have the capacity to support commercial products manufactured under cGMP by biopharmaceutical firms or may otherwise be ill-equipped to support our needs. We also do not have supply contracts with many of these suppliers and may not be able to obtain supply contracts with them on acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, we may experience delays in receiving key materials and equipment to support clinical or commercial manufacturing.\nFor some of these reagents, equipment, and materials, we rely and may in the future rely on sole source vendors or a limited number of vendors. An inability to continue to source product from any of these suppliers, which could be due to regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor disputes or shortages, unexpected demands, or quality issues, could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our product candidates, which could adversely and materially affect our product sales and operating results or our ability to conduct clinical trials, either of which could significantly harm our business.\nAs we continue to develop and scale our manufacturing process, we expect that we will need to obtain rights to and supplies of certain materials and equipment to be used as part of that process. We may not be able to obtain rights to such materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and if we are unable to alter our process in a commercially viable manner to avoid the use of such materials or find a suitable substitute, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience in marketing products. We intend to develop an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources, and time. We will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train, and retain marketing and sales personnel. If we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and commercial distribution capabilities for any or all products we develop, we will likely pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties, and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales and commercial distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to successfully commercialize any product in the United States or overseas, and as a result, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business internationally could materially adversely affect our business. We plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we, and any potential collaborators in those jurisdictions, will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls, and other regulatory requirements;\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign laws;\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our planned international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry, and the rapidly evolving market for developing cell-based therapies in particular, is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations as well as established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors, either alone or with collaborative partners, may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug or biologic products that are more effective, safer, more easily commercialized, or less costly than our product candidates or may develop proprietary technologies or secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products.\nSpecifically, we face significant competition from companies in the insulin therapy market. Insulin therapy is widely used for Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) patients who are not controlled with oral medications. The global diabetes market comprising the insulin, insulin analogues and other anti-diabetic drugs has been evolving rapidly. A look at the diabetes market reveals that it is dominated by a handful of participants such as Novo Nordisk A/S, Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi-Aventis, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Pfizer Inc., Merck KgaA, and Bayer AG. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we may not be the first to market and that may affect the price or demand for our product candidates. Additionally, the availability and price of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances. Additionally, a competitor could obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA with respect to such competitor\u2019s product. If such competitor product is determined to be the same product as one of our product candidates, that may prevent us from obtaining approval from the FDA for such product candidate for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances.\nWe are highly dependent on our key personnel, and if we are not successful in attracting, motivating and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, particularly our chief science officer, Prof. Sarah Ferber, our chief executive officer, Vered Caplan and the chief executive officer of our U.S. Subsidiary, Scott Carmer. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees, and other scientific and medical advisors, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could result in delays in product development and harm our business. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high, which may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock option grants that vest over time. The value to employees of these equity grants that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Although we have employment agreements with our key employees, these employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of all of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nWe will need to grow the size and capabilities of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of November 30, 2014, we had 1 full-time employee and 6 part time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we must add a significant number of additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, and other personnel. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\nidentifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining, and motivating additional employees;\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and FDA review process for our product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and\nimproving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our efforts to manage our growth are complicated by the fact that all of our executive officers other than our chief executive officer have joined us since August 2014. This lack of long-term experience working together may adversely impact our senior management team\u2019s ability to effectively manage our business and growth.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services. There can be no assurance that the services of these independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, if at all. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development, and commercialization goals.\nWe have entered into collaborations and may form or seek collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nWe may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Further, collaborations involving our product candidates, such as our collaborations with third-party research institutions, are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration;\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\ndisputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and\ncollaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nAs a result, if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks.\nWe may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies, or businesses. As more fully described in the section \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d in the footnotes to our financial statements, on November 6, 2014, we entered into a share exchange agreement with MaSTherCell SA and Cell Therapy Holding SA (collectively \u201cMaSTherCell\u201d) and each of the shareholders of MaSTherCell, which provides for the acquisition by our company of all of the issued and outstanding shares of MaSTherCell from the shareholders of MaSTherCell in exchange for the issuance of $24,593,000 in value of shares of common stock in the capital of our company. MasTHerCell SA and Cell Therapy Holding SA are private limited liability companies incorporated in Belgium. MaSTherCell is a technology-driven, customer-oriented Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) specialized in cell therapy development for advanced medicinal products. MaSTherCell's mission is to help customers bring highly potent cell therapy products faster to the market. As of the date of this filing, the share exchange agreement has not closed yet. Any other potential acquisitions or strategic partnerships may entail numerous risks, including:\nincreased operating expenses and cash requirements;\nthe assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\nthe issuance of our equity securities;\nassimilation of operations, intellectual property and products of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition;\nretention of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and regulatory approvals; and\nour inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nIn addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\ndecreased demand for our products;\ninjury to our reputation;\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants and inability to continue clinical trials;\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\nloss of revenue;\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\nthe inability to commercialize any product candidate; and\na decline in our share price.\nBecause our products have not reached clinical or commercial stage, we do not currently carry clinical trial or product liability insurance. In the future, our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop, alone or with collaborators. Such insurance policies may also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nIf we issue additional shares in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 1,750,000,000 shares of our common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more companies or products and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements. The issuance of any such shares will reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our company.\nTrading of our stock is restricted by the Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our stock.\nOur common stock is illiquid and the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors that are unrelated to our operations.\nAlthough our common stock is currently listed for quotation on the QB, there is no market for our common stock. Even when a market is established and trading begins, trading through the OTCQB is frequently thin and highly volatile. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will develop in our stock, in which case it could be difficult for stockholders to sell their stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of our competitors, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on any investment in the shares of stock of our company.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends, and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in our company will need to come through an increase in the stock\u2019s price. This may never happen and investors may lose all of their investment in our company.", "PERMNO": 17370, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ORGS"}
