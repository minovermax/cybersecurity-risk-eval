{"cik": "1561627", "company": "ExOne Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, in evaluating our business, future prospects and an investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may not be able to significantly increase the number of materials in which we can print products fast enough to meet our business plan.\nOur business plan is heavily dependent upon our ability to steadily increase the number of qualified materials in which our machines can print products. Our 3D printing machines are capable of direct product materialization by printing in industrial metals, including stainless steel, bronze, iron, bonded tungsten, IN Alloy 625 and glass. We are in varying stages of qualifying additional industrial materials and advancing materials that are printable in our machines. By expanding into these other materials, we believe we can expand our market share and better serve our industrial customer base. Qualifying new materials is a complicated engineering task, and there is no way to predict whether, or when, any given material will be qualified. If we cannot hire people with sufficient technical skills to work on qualifying new materials for printing, or if we lack the resources necessary to create a steady flow of new materials, we will not be able to meet our business plan goals and a competitor may emerge that is better at qualifying new materials, either of which would have an adverse effect on our business results.\nAny future success in qualifying new materials for printing may attract more competitors into our markets, including competitors with greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we have.\nIf we succeed in qualifying a growing number of materials for use in our 3D printing machines, that will increase our addressable market. However, as we create a larger addressable market, our market may become more attractive to other 3D printing companies or large companies that are not 3D printing companies, but which may see an economic opportunity in the markets we have created. Because we are a supplier of 3D printed products to industrial companies, an increase in the number of competitors for our addressable market is likely to adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not be able to adequately increase demand for our products.\nOur business plan is built around a steady increase in the demand for our products. However, only a relatively small number of our potential customers know of the existence of AM and are familiar with its capabilities, and even fewer understand the potential benefits of using AM to manufacture products. If we do not develop effective strategies to raise awareness among potential customers of the benefits of AM and 3D printing, we may be unable to achieve our planned rate of growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to hire the number of skilled employees that we need to achieve our business plan.\nFor our business to grow in accordance with our business plan, we will need to recruit, hire, integrate and retain additional employees with the technical competence and engineering skills to operate our machines, improve our technology and processes and expand our technological capability to print using an increasing variety of materials. People with these skills are in short supply and may not be available in sufficient numbers to allow us to meet the goals of our business plan. In addition, new employees often require significant training and, in many cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain employees, including significant expenditures related to salaries and benefits, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. Moreover, new employees may not be or become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. In addition, as we move into new geographic areas, we will need to recruit skilled employees in those areas. If we cannot obtain the services of a sufficient number of technically skilled employees, we may not be able to achieve our planned rate of growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate.\nOur revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are likely to continue to vary due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. Because our business is changing and evolving rapidly, our historical operating results may not be useful in predicting our future operating results. A significant portion of our machine orders are typically received during the third or fourth quarter of the fiscal year as a result of the timing of capital expenditures of our customers. Thus, revenues and operating results for any future period are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty. We also typically experience weaker demand for our machines in the first and second quarters. For these reasons, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nFluctuations in our operating results and financial condition may occur due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below and those identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u2022\nThe degree of market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nThe mix of products that we sell during any period;\n\u2022\nOur long sales cycle;\n\u2022\nGenerally weaker demand for machines in the first and second quarters;\n\u2022\nDevelopment of competitive systems by others;\n\u2022\nOur response to price competition;\n\u2022\nDelays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced machines and products and the generation of sales from those products;\n\u2022\nChanges in the amount we spend to promote our products and services;\n\u2022\nThe geographic distribution of our sales;\n\u2022\nChanges in the cost of satisfying our warranty obligations and servicing our installed base of products;\n\u2022\nOur level of research and development activities and their associated costs and rates of success;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic and industry conditions that affect end-user demand and end-user levels of product design and manufacturing, including the adverse effects of the current economic crisis affecting Europe;\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting rules and tax laws; or\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates that affect returns on our cash balances and short-term investments.\nDue to the foregoing factors, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year comparisons of our operating results as an indicator of future performance.\nWe may not be able to generate operating profits.\nSince our inception, we have not generated operating profits. In the event that we are unable to execute on our business plan, we may be unable to generate profits in the future.\nOur operating expenses (which include research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses) were approximately $29.9 million (excluding approximately $4.4 million of a goodwill impairment charge), $32.2 million and $21.2 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Our research and development expenses are due primarily to continued investment in our 3D printing machine technology and costs associated with our materials qualification activities, including research and development headcount. Our selling, general and administrative expenses are due primarily to personnel costs associated with managing a public company and certain professional service fees (including legal, audit and other consulting expenses). We believe that our operating expenses may increase in future periods as we pursue our growth strategies. Increases in our research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses will directly affect our future results of operations and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may incur future impairment charges to our long-lived assets held for use.\nAs a result of continued operating losses and cash flow deficiencies, during 2015 we completed certain tests for the recoverability of long-lived assets held for use at the asset group level. Assessing the recoverability of long-lived assets held for use requires significant judgments and estimates by management. We will be required to conduct additional testing for the recoverability of long-lived assets held for use to the extent that a triggering event requiring such test is identified in a future period. A significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, adverse change in the use or condition of a long-lived asset, adverse change in the business climate or legal or regulatory factors impacting a long-lived asset and continued operating losses and cash flow deficiencies associated with a long-lived asset, among other indicators, could cause a future assessment to be performed which may result in an impairment of long-lived assets held for use. The amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recorded.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of our continued operating losses, cash flow deficiencies and liquidity, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude, in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements that there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. If our independent registered public accounting firm issues a \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion, it could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives. If we fail to raise sufficient additional capital, we will not be able to completely execute our business plan. As a result our business would be jeopardized and the Company may not be able to continue.\nWe may not be able to introduce new machines and related industrial materials acceptable to the market or to improve the technology and industrial materials used in our current machines.\nOur revenues are derived from the sale of 3D printing machines for, and products manufactured using, AM. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in a market subject to innovation and rapidly developing and changing technology. A variety of technologies have the capacity to compete against one another in our market, which is, in part, driven by technological advances and end-user requirements and preferences, as well as the emergence of new standards and practices. Our ability to compete in the industrial AM market depends, in large part, on our success in enhancing and developing new 3D printing machines, in enhancing our current 3D printing machines, in enhancing and adding to our technology, and in developing and qualifying new industrial materials in which we can print. We believe that to remain competitive we must continuously enhance and expand the functionality and features of our products and technologies. However, we may not be able to:\n\u2022\nEnhance our existing products and technologies;\n\u2022\nContinue to leverage advances in industrial printhead technology;\n\u2022\nDevelop new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective end-users, particularly with respect to the physical properties of industrial materials and other consumables;\n\u2022\nRespond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis;\n\u2022\nDevelop products that are cost-effective or that otherwise gain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nDistinguish ourselves from our competitors in our industry; and\n\u2022\nAdequately protect our intellectual property as we develop new products and technologies.\nExOne 3D printing machine customer contractual requirements often have specific, individual needs that may in turn impact the period in which we recognize the revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) relating to that 3D printing machine sale.\nOnce a customer makes the decision to purchase a 3D printing machine from us, we may then be required to address specific, individual factors relating, among other things, to that customer\u2019s purchase, its intended use of that 3D printing machine or relating to the installation of that machine in the customer\u2019s facilities. These specific, individual requirements are often required by the customer to be included in our commercial agreements relating to the purchase. As a result, our responsiveness to our customers\u2019 specific requirements has the potential to impact the period in which we recognize the revenue relating to that 3D printing machine sale.\nIf the market does not develop as we expect, our revenues may stagnate or decline.\nThe marketplace for industrial manufacturing is dominated by conventional manufacturing methods that do not involve AM technology. If AM technology does not gain market acceptance as an alternative for industrial manufacturing, or if the marketplace adopts AM based on a technology other than our technology, we may not be able to increase or sustain the level of sales of our products and 3D printing machines and our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result.\nLoss of key management or sales or customer service personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent on the skills, experience and efforts of our management and other key personnel. We must continue to develop and retain a core group of management individuals if we are to realize our goal of continued expansion and growth. While we have not previously experienced significant problems attracting and retaining members of our management team and other key personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to retain these individuals and the loss of any or all of these individuals could materially and adversely affect our business. We do not carry key-man insurance on any member of management.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with doing business globally.\nSales outside of the United States were 50.9%, 51.9% and 63.0% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, one of our growth strategies is to pursue additional opportunities for our business in several areas of the world outside of the United States, any or all of which could be adversely affected by the risks set forth below. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks associated with the political, regulatory and economic conditions of the countries in which we operate, such as:\n\u2022\nCivil unrest, acts of terrorism and similar events;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nPotentially longer sales and payment cycles;\n\u2022\nPotentially greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nReduced protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nLaws and business practices favoring local competition;\n\u2022\nCosts and difficulties of customizing products for foreign countries;\n\u2022\nCompliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties and regulations;\n\u2022\nTariffs, trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets; and\n\u2022\nBecoming subject to the laws, regulations and court systems of many jurisdictions.\nAny of these factors could materially adversely affect sales of our products to global customers or harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the consequences of terrorism or armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our market opportunities or our business.\nContinuing political instability in the Ukraine, sanctions against Russia, and Russia\u2019s response to those sanctions, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2014, the Crimea region of the Ukraine was annexed by Russia. In response to this annexation and subsequent hostilities aimed at the Ukraine, other nations, including the United States and the European Union, imposed evolving economic sanctions against Russia. United States and European concerns related to the political and military conditions in the region have prompted increasing levels of economic sanctions, targeting certain Russian companies in the finance, energy and defense industries and named Russian nationals that have been deemed to have direct involvement in destabilizing the situation in the Ukraine, as well as imposing restrictions on trading and access to capital markets (\u201cRussian Sanctions\u201d). In response, Russia announced its own trading sanctions against nations that implemented or supported the Russian Sanctions, including the United States and some European Union nations.\nOne of our growth strategies is to pursue opportunities for our business in several areas of the world outside of the United States. This strategy includes pursuing opportunities in Russia through our German subsidiary, ExOne GmbH, which has sold products and services (including 3D printing machines) to customers located in Russia.\nExOne GmbH is subject to the Russian Sanctions, primarily those imposed by the European Union, specifically Germany, related to doing business in Russia. The Russian Sanctions may delay or prevent ExOne GmbH\u2019s ability to collect on existing or future accounts receivable from customers in Russia, to make future sales and to service existing ExOne equipment in Russia or to sell and deliver spare parts and consumables for our machines located in Russia.\nIn the event that the United States\u2019 and the European Union\u2019s political relationships with Russia further deteriorate, it is possible that additional and even more severe sanctions could be imposed by the United States or European Union against Russia or that Russia could impose additional retaliatory measures in response to current or future Russian Sanctions. These possible additional sanctions and measures could further disrupt or prevent our ability to do any business in Russia, may further increase the economic uncertainty in the affected regions and lead to further fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies, such as the Euro, used in these regions.\nOur international operations pose currency risks, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating results may be affected by volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to effectively manage our currency transaction and translation risks. In general, we conduct our business, earn revenue and incur costs in the local currency of the countries in which we operate. As a result, our international operations present risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations. The financial condition and results of operations of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to United States dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. We do not manage our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Therefore, changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the United States dollar will affect the recorded levels of our foreign assets and liabilities, as well as our revenues, cost of sales, and operating margins, and could result in exchange losses in any given reporting period.\nIn the future, we may not benefit from favorable exchange rate translation effects, and unfavorable exchange rate translation effects may harm our operating results. In addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever we enter into either a purchase or a sale transaction using a different currency from the currency in which we receive revenues. In such cases we may suffer an exchange loss because we do not currently engage in currency swaps or other currency hedging strategies to address this risk.\nGiven the volatility of exchange rates, we can give no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks or that any volatility in currency exchange rates will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOne of our principal stockholders is able to exert substantial influence in determining the outcome of matters which require the approval of our stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2015, S. Kent Rockwell, our Chairman and CEO, beneficially owned approximately 21.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock. On January 11, 2016, we entered into a subscription agreement with an entity under common control by Mr. Rockwell resulting in the issuance of an additional 1,423,877 shares of our common stock to the related entity. Immediately following this issuance, Mr. Rockwell beneficially owned approximately 28.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of his ownership percentage in our common shares, Mr. Rockwell may have effective control over the election of our Board of Directors and the direction of our affairs. As a result, he could exert considerable influence over the outcome of any corporate matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any transaction that might cause a change in control, such as a merger or acquisition. Any stockholders in favor of a matter that is opposed by Mr. Rockwell would have to obtain a significant number of votes to overrule the votes of Mr. Rockwell.\nWe may need to raise additional capital from time to time if we are going to meet our growth strategy and may be unable to do so on attractive terms.\nExpanding our business to meet the growth strategy may require additional investments of capital from time to time, and our existing sources of cash and any funds generated from operations may not provide us with sufficient capital. For various reasons, including any current noncompliance with existing or future lending arrangements, additional financing may not be available when needed, or may not be available on terms favorable to us. If we fail to obtain adequate capital on a timely basis or if capital cannot be obtained at reasonable costs, we may not be able to achieve our planned rate of growth, which will adversely affect our results of operations. Additional equity financing may result in ownership and economic dilution to our existing stockholders and/or require us to grant certain rights and preferences to new investors. Also, although S. Kent Rockwell, our Chairman and CEO and our controlling stockholder, recently provided capital to us through a related entity, he has no obligation to do so and our stockholders should have no expectation that he will do so in the future.\nOn January 8, 2016, we announced our entry into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (\u201cATM\u201d) with FBR Capital Markets & Co. (\u201cFBR\u201d) and MLV & Co. LLC (\u201cMLV\u201d) pursuant to which FBR and MLV will act as distribution agents in the sale of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate of ExOne common equity in \u201cat the market offerings\u201d as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Our ability to raise capital through the use of our ATM may be restricted for various reasons, including our adherence with SEC regulations prohibiting the sale of our common equity securities for certain periods of time or other adverse market conditions.\nWe are highly dependent upon sales to certain industries.\nOur revenues of 3D printing machines and products have historically been concentrated to companies in the aerospace, automotive, heavy equipment, and energy/oil/gas industries and those industries\u2019 respective suppliers. To the extent any of these industries experience a downturn, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFor example, the energy/oil/gas industry is highly cyclical and demand for our products and services in such industry is substantially dependent on the level of expenditures by the industry for the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are sensitive to oil and natural gas prices and generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future oil and gas prices. Crude oil prices have dropped precipitously since September 2014. As oil and gas companies reduce planned capital spending in light of the decline in commodity prices, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, if any of these industries or their respective suppliers or other providers of manufacturing services develop new technologies or alternatives to manufacture the products that are currently manufactured using our 3D printing machines, it may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are currently dependent on a single supplier of certain printhead components.\nWe currently rely on a single source to supply certain printhead components used by our 3D printing machines. While we believe that there are other suppliers of printhead components upon which we could rely, we could experience delays and interruptions if our supply is interrupted that might temporarily impact the financial performance of our business.\nWe may not be able to manage the expansion of our operations effectively in order to achieve our projected levels of growth.\nWe have expanded our operations significantly in recent periods, and our business plan calls for further expansion over the next several years. We anticipate that further development of our infrastructure and an increase in the number of our employees will be required to achieve our planned broadening of our product offerings and customer base, improvements in our 3D printing machines and materials used in our 3D printing machines, and our planned international growth. In particular, we must increase our marketing and services staff to support new marketing and service activities and to meet the needs of both new and existing customers. Our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our management to manage our growth effectively. If our management is unsuccessful in meeting these challenges, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to consummate and/or effectively integrate strategic transactions.\nWe may from time to time engage in strategic transaction with third parties if we determine that they will likely provide future financial and operational benefits. Successful completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, our ability to effectively integrate an investment into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future operational performance for the combined businesses.\nWe completed two acquisitions in the first quarter of 2014 and are currently exploring a combination of strategic investments, and/or alliances, some of which we believe will promote advances in pre-print and post-print processes. With respect to strategic investments, and/or alliances we are currently pursuing, there is no guarantee that we will complete such transactions on favorable terms or at all. The exploration, negotiation, and consummation of strategic investments and/or alliances may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred. We may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete a specific investment, or alliance on favorable terms. If we do complete transactions, they may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or may not be accretive to ExOne for a period of time which may be significant following the completion of such transaction.\nWe may be required to pay cash, incur debt and/or issue equity securities to pay for any such transaction, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the value of our common stock. Our use of cash to pay for transactions would limit other potential uses of our cash, including investments in our sales and marketing and product development organizations, and in infrastructure. The issuance or sale of equity or convertible debt securities to finance any such transactions would result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur debt, it could result in increased fixed obligations and could also impose covenants or other restrictions that could impede our ability to manage our operations.\nGlobal economic, political and social conditions have adversely impacted our sales and may continue to do so.\nThe uncertain direction and relative strength of the global economy, difficulties in the financial services sector and credit markets, continuing geopolitical uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors all affect spending behavior of potential end-users of our products. The prospects for economic growth in the United States and other countries (particularly countries within Europe, Russia, India and China) remain uncertain and may cause end-users to further delay or reduce technology purchases. The recent global financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets has resulted in a tightening of credit markets, lower levels of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. These conditions may make it more difficult for our end-users to obtain financing.\nAs a global company, we may be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we currently or may in the future operate, or various international trade and export laws.\nOur business plan envisions that we will conduct increasing amounts of business outside of the United States, which will create various domestic and foreign regulatory challenges. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit United States-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-United States officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have policies and controls in place designed to ensure internal and external compliance with these and other anti-bribery laws. To ensure compliance, our anti-bribery policy and training on a global basis provides our employees with procedures, guidelines and information about anti-bribery obligations and compliance. Further, we require our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with anti-bribery laws. We also have procedures and controls in place designed to ensure internal and external compliance. However, such anti-bribery policy, training, internal controls, and procedures will not always protect us from reckless, criminal or unintentional acts committed by our employees, agents or other persons associated with us. If we are found to be in violation of the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws (either due to the intentional or inadvertent acts of our employees, or due to the intentional or inadvertent acts of others), we could suffer criminal or civil penalties, including monetary damages or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide analytical information to management. We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate. Our IT systems allow us to efficiently purchase products from our suppliers, provide procurement and logistic services, ship products to our customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide superior service to our customers. Our IT systems are an essential component of our business and growth strategies, and a disruption to or failure of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss, including as a result of natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunication services, operator negligence, loss of data, security breaches and computer viruses. If our systems for protecting against cyber security risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, or client data, interruption of business operations, or additional costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyber security attacks. Any such disruption or loss of business information could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulations related to conflict-free minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and may create challenges with our customers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the \u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. These conflict minerals include tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten. The SEC has established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who manufacture or contract to manufacture certain products containing conflict minerals sourced from the DRC and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain these conflict-free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Compliance with these requirements may also increase our costs, including costs that may be incurred in conducting due diligence procedures to determine the sources of certain minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, we may face challenges with our customers if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products.\nWe could be subject to personal injury, property damage, product liability, warranty and other claims involving allegedly defective products that we supply.\nThe products we supply are sometimes used in potentially hazardous applications, such as the assembled parts of an aircraft or automobile, that could result in death, personal injury, property damage, loss of production, punitive damages and consequential damages. While we have not experienced any such claims to date, actual or claimed defects in the products we supply could result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims.\nWe attempt to include provisions in our agreements with customers that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in our products. However, it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future.\nAny such lawsuit, regardless of merit, could result in material expense, diversion of management time and efforts, and damage to our reputation, and could cause us to fail to retain or attract customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various product and non-product related claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies arising out of our commercial operations. We maintain insurance to cover our potential exposure for most claims and losses. However, our insurance coverage is subject to various exclusions, self-retentions and deductibles, may be inadequate or unavailable to protect us fully, and may be cancelled or otherwise terminated by the insurer. Furthermore, we face the following additional risks under our insurance coverage:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to continue to obtain insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nWe may be faced with types of liabilities that are not covered under our insurance policies, such as environmental contamination or terrorist attacks, and that exceed any amounts that we may have reserved for such liabilities;\n\u2022\nThe amount of any liabilities that we may face may exceed our policy limits and any amounts we may have reserved for such liabilities; and\n\u2022\nWe may incur losses resulting from interruption of our business that may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nEven a partially uninsured claim of significant size, if successful, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. However, even if we successfully defend ourselves against any such claim, we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses, our management could be required to spend valuable time in the defense against these claims and our reputation could suffer, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf any of our manufacturing facilities or PSCs are disrupted, sales of our products may be disrupted, which could result in loss of revenues and an increase in unforeseen costs.\nWe manufacture our machines at our facilities in Gersthofen, Germany and North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Our PSCs are located in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania; Troy, Michigan; Houston, Texas; Auburn, Washington; North Las Vegas, Nevada; Gersthofen, Germany, Desenzano del Garda, Italy; J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden; and Kanagawa, Japan.\nIf the operations of these facilities are materially disrupted, we would be unable to fulfill customer orders for the period of the disruption, we would not be able to recognize revenue on orders, and we might need to modify our standard sales terms to secure the commitment of new customers during the period of the disruption and perhaps longer. Depending on the cause of the disruption, we could incur significant costs to remedy the disruption and resume product shipments. Such a disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnder applicable employment laws, we may not be able to enforce covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our former employees.\nWe generally enter into non-competition agreements with our employees. These agreements prohibit our employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors or customers for a limited period. We may be unable to enforce these agreements under the laws of the jurisdictions in which our employees work, including Germany, Italy, Sweden and Japan, and it may be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from benefitting from the expertise of our former employees or consultants developed while working for us. If we cannot demonstrate that our legally protectable interests will be harmed, we may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of our former employees or consultants and our ability to remain competitive may be diminished.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our trade secrets and intellectual property.\nWhile some of our technology is licensed under patents belonging to others or is covered by process patents which are owned or applied for by us, much of our key technology is not protected by patents. Since we cannot legally prevent one or more other companies from developing similar or identical technology to our unpatented technology, it is likely that, over time, one or more other companies may be able to replicate our technology, thereby reducing our technological advantages. If we do not protect our technology or are unable to develop new technology that can be protected by patents or as trade secrets, we may face increased competition from other companies, which may adversely affect our results of operations. We generally enter into confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and advertisers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot provide assurance that any steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets and intellectual property.\nWe enjoy license rights and exclusivity of certain patents and intellectual property and cannot adequately estimate the effects of their expiration upon the entrance or advancement of competitors into the AM industrial market.\nWe have exclusive license and non-exclusive license rights to certain patents that we utilize in the industrial market. Some of these patents expired in 2015, and others are scheduled to expire in future periods. The expiration of these patents could reduce barriers to entry into the AM industrial market, which could result in the reduction of our market share and earnings potential. We cannot adequately estimate the effect that the expiration of these patents will have upon the entrance or advancement of other AM manufacturers into the industrial market.\nWe may not be able to obtain patent protection or otherwise adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could impair our competitive position.\nOur success and future revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as non-disclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes globally. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use, or disclose our technologies and processes. We cannot assure you that any of our existing or future patents or other intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or will otherwise provide us with meaningful protection. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents corresponding to our United States or foreign patent applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our patents and other intellectual property protections do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. We may not be able to detect the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and processes or take appropriate steps to prevent such use. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. Any of the foregoing events would lead to increased competition and lower revenue or gross profits, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to alleged infringement claims.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from individuals, vendors, and other companies who have acquired or developed patents in the field of AM for purposes of developing competing products or for the sole purpose of asserting claims against us. Any claims that our products or processes infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending, and resolving such claims, and may prohibit or otherwise impair our ability to commercialize new or existing products. If we are unable to effectively defend our technologies and processes, our market share, sales and profitability could suffer, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCertain of our employees and patents are subject to German law.\nMany of our employees work in Germany and are subject to German employment law. Ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by such employees and consultants are subject to the provisions of the German Act on Employees\u2019 Inventions (Gesetz \u00fcber Arbeitnehmererfindungen), which regulates the ownership of, and compensation for, inventions made by employees. We face the risk that disputes can occur between us and our employees or ex-employees pertaining to alleged non-adherence to the provisions of this act that may be costly to defend and take up our management\u2019s time and efforts whether we prevail or fail in such dispute. In addition, under the German Act on Employees\u2019 Inventions, certain employees retained rights to patents they invented or co-invented prior to 2009. Although most of these employees have subsequently assigned their interest in these patents to us, there is a risk that the compensation we provided to them may be deemed to be insufficient in the future and we may be required under German law to increase the compensation due to such employee for the use of their patent. In those cases where employees have not assigned their interests to us, we may need to pay compensation for the use of those patents. If we are required to pay additional compensation or face other disputes under the German Act on Employees\u2019 Inventions, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe have broad discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from securities offerings and may not use them effectively.\nWe cannot specify with certainty how we will use the net proceeds that we have received or will receive from securities offerings. Our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and we may use these proceeds in ways with which you may disagree or for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of the offering. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from a securities offering in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur as a result of our recently announced \u201cat the market offerings,\u201d other utilization of our universal shelf registration statement or otherwise could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional\nequity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or the market perception that we are permitted to sell a significant number of our securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is expected to continue to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by numerous factors, including the risk factors described in this report and other factors which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:\n\u2022\nFailure to meet our targeted revenues and gross margin;\n\u2022\nSignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies in our sector, which is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;\n\u2022\nThe mix of products that we sell, and related services that we provide, during any period;\n\u2022\nDelays between our expenditures to develop and market new products and the generation of sales from those products;\n\u2022\nChanges in the amount that we spend to develop, acquire or license new products, technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nChanges in our expenditures to promote our products and services;\n\u2022\nChanges in the cost of satisfying our warranty obligations and servicing our installed base of systems;\n\u2022\nSuccess or failure of research and development projects of us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of technological innovations, new solutions or enhancements or strategic partnerships or acquisitions by us or one of our competitors;\n\u2022\nThe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nThe general tendency towards volatility in the market prices of shares of companies that rely on technology and innovation;\n\u2022\nChanges in regulatory policies or tax guidelines;\n\u2022\nChanges or perceived changes in earnings or variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nAny shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nThe market\u2019s reaction to our reduced disclosure as a result of being an EGC under the JOBS Act;\n\u2022\nThreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nChanges in our senior management; and\n\u2022\nGeneral economic trends and other external factors.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our shares, the price of our shares could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have control over these analysts, and we do not have commitments from them to write research reports about us. The price of our shares could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrades our shares, issues other unfavorable commentary, or ceases publishing reports about us or our business.\nThe price of our shares could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly by our directors, their affiliates or our executive officers, or when there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale. The perception in the public market that our stockholders might sell our shares also could depress the market price of our shares. From time to time, we may conduct offerings of our securities and our executive officers, directors and selling stockholders would be subject to lock-up agreements that restrict their ability to transfer their shares following the offering. The market price of our shares may drop significantly when the restrictions on resale by our existing stockholders lapse and these stockholders are able to sell their shares into the market. If this occurs, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities, should we desire to do so.\nWe are incurring increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company whose shares are listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, we incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses will increase even more after we are no longer an EGC. We incur significant costs associated with our compliance with the public company reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, requirements imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (most notably Section 404), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, and other rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. Compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs, introduced new costs (including stock exchange listing fees and costs related to investor relations and stockholder reporting), and made certain activities more time-consuming and costly. They also make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we incur substantial costs to maintain sufficient coverage.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure create uncertainty for public companies generally, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We have invested resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur in the future to respond to these constantly evolving requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nAs long as we remain an EGC as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not EGCs. These exemptions include, but are not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, less extensive disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We will continue to operate under these provisions for up to five years from our IPO or such earlier time that we are no longer an EGC. We would cease to be an EGC if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Exchange Act, which requires us to have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates at the end of our second fiscal quarter, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Therefore, if our share price does not appreciate, our investors may not gain and could potentially lose on their investment in our shares.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our shares will be investors\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe right of shareholders to receive liquidation and dividend payments on our common stock is junior to the rights of holders of future indebtedness and to any other senior securities we may issue in the future.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. This means that the shares of common stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us, including our liquidation. Additionally, holders of our common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock, if any. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue classes or series of preferred stock in the future without any action on the part of our common shareholders.\nAs an EGC under the JOBS Act we follow certain permitted corporate governance practices instead of the otherwise applicable SEC and NASDAQ requirements, which may result in less protection than is accorded to investors in a non-EGC.\nAs an EGC we follow certain corporate governance practices instead of those otherwise required by the SEC and under the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Following our EGC governance practices, as opposed to the requirements that would otherwise apply to a company listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, may provide less protection to you than what is accorded to investors under the Listing Rules for the NASDAQ Stock Market applicable to non-EGC issuers and could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an EGC, we delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards, which may make our stock less attractive to investors and our trading price more volatile.\nPursuant to the JOBS Act, as an EGC, we have elected to take advantage of an extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or the SEC, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an EGC, will delay adoption of the standard until it applies to private companies. This may make a comparison of our financial statements with any other public company that is either not an EGC or is an EGC that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult, as different or revised standards may be used. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and could decline.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. The term \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\u201d as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company\u2019s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We are required under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, we concluded that there are material weaknesses in the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as defined in SEC Regulation S-X. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A description of the identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting is as follows:\n\u2022\nThe design and operating effectiveness of internal controls related to our financial reporting process were not sufficient to allow for accurate and timely reporting of our consolidated financial results. We did not maintain adequate control with respect to the application of GAAP. This was principally due to a lack of personnel with adequate knowledge and experience in GAAP. As a result, we recorded certain manual, post-close adjustments in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022\nThe design and operating effectiveness of internal controls related to our information technology systems was not sufficient to allow for accurate and timely reporting of our consolidated financial results. Each of our primary locations (United States, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Japan) utilizes separate and distinct information technology platforms to record, process and summarize transactions. As a result, our process to consolidate and report financial information is substantially a manual process and inherently subject to error.\n\u2022\nThe design and operating effectiveness of internal controls related to our consolidation process and management\u2019s review of our consolidated financial results did not operate at a level of precision sufficient to allow for accurate and timely reporting of our consolidated financial results. Our consolidation process is substantially a manual process and inherently subject to error. Further, because of internal control weaknesses identified with respect to our financial reporting process and information technology systems, management was unable to complete an adequate review of either subsidiary or consolidated financial results at a sufficient level of precision to prevent or detect misstatements. As a result, we recorded certain manual, post-close adjustments in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nWith the oversight of senior management and our audit committee, we have put into place a comprehensive plan to remediate the underlying causes of the identified material weaknesses. Our plan throughout 2015 was, and into 2016 is, to continue to take additional steps and implement measures to remediate the underlying causes of the identified material weaknesses, including:\n(i)\nEnhancing our global accounting and reporting process (including our global consolidation of financial information) by redesigning and strengthening the operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. This includes a detailed review of our existing processes, improvements to the design of our internal controls (including conversion of historically manual control activities to automated control activities), updating documentation related to our business process flows, internal testing of operating effectiveness of our controls and remediation activities, as necessary. This process began in mid-2014 and we expect it to continue during 2016 and beyond as a means of continuous improvement.\n(ii)\nEvaluating our information technology systems to further integrate existing systems or invest in improvements to our technology sufficient to generate accurate and timely financial information. On January 1, 2015, we implemented the first phase of a new ERP system for our Europe operations. Despite certain difficulties encountered in the initial implementation phase of this project, resulting in a delay of the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2015, we believe that this system, when fully implemented, provides a substantial upgrade in operational and financial reporting as compared to our legacy systems. We continue to address the difficulties encountered in the initial implementation in a variety of ways, including through the direct hire of personnel and collaboration with external consultants, both with system expertise, in an effort to resolve identified issues in a timely and efficient manner. Our 2016 information technology plan includes additional upgrades or enhancements of both this system, as well as our other existing information technologies with the overall goal of a simple, common and global platform for processing, recording and analyzing financial and operational data.\n(iii)\nContinuing to add financial personnel with adequate knowledge and experience in GAAP. In 2015, we hired a new Chief Financial Officer and new Heads of Accounting and Controlling for our Europe operations, each of whom possess extensive knowledge of GAAP and experience in working with or for a United States based multi-national operation. As part of our redesign of our global reporting structure and responsibilities, we have added additional personnel (both temporary and permanent) with requisite GAAP experience to both our United States and Europe operations during 2015. We do not expect a further significant investment in personnel in 2016.\nWe documented and evaluated our internal control over financial reporting in order to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls as of December 31, 2015, and, as described in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2015. Furthermore, as our business continues to grow internationally, our internal controls will become more complex and will require significantly more resources and attention to remediate existing control deficiencies and improve the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our share price may suffer.\nNotwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdditionally, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As an EGC, we will not be required to comply with Section 404(b) until we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the SEC, provided we maintain our status as an EGC until December 31, 2018.\nThe additional measures necessary to remediate the underlying causes of our identified material weaknesses and our future compliance with Section 404(b) will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm begins its Section 404(b) attestations, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, investor groups like Institutional Shareholder Services could initiate a withhold vote campaign with respect to the re-election of the members of our audit committee, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nProvisions in our charter documents or Delaware law may inhibit a takeover or make it more difficult to effect a change in control, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain, and Delaware corporate law contains, provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions will apply even if some of our stockholders consider the offer to be beneficial or favorable. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nRaising additional capital by issuing securities may cause dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may need or desire to raise substantial additional capital in the future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nOur degree of success in capturing a larger portion of the industrial products production market;\n\u2022\nThe costs of establishing or acquiring sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for our products;\n\u2022\nThe costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our issued patents, and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nThe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies and other strategic relationships; and\n\u2022\nThe costs of financing unanticipated working capital requirements and responding to competitive pressures.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, including through the use of our ATM, we will reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders, and the holders of those newly-issued equity or convertible debt securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those possessed by our then-existing stockholders. Additionally, future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13799, "SIC": 3550, "TIC": "XONE"}
