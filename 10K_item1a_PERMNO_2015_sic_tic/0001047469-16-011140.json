RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks occurs, our business, business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Evaluation of Strategic Alternatives and Our Business\nOur exploration of strategic alternatives may not be successful.\nWe have implemented operating cost reductions and organizational restructurings, including a recent reduction in our workforce, to reduce overall cash burn. As previously announced in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2016, reporting the restructuring of our workforce, we have been considering potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value. Such strategic alternatives include, but are not limited to, a sale of the company, a business combination or collaboration, joint development and partnership opportunities, a distribution of all or a significant amount of cash to stockholders, and liquidation of the company. We do not know if we will be successful in pursuing any strategic alternative or that any transaction will occur; however, we are committed to pursuing a strategic direction that our Board of Directors believes is in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never reach profitability.\nSince inception we have incurred significant operating losses and, as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $706.2 million. We expect to continue to incur operating expenses and anticipate that we will continue to have losses in the foreseeable future as we evaluate and potentially act on strategic alternatives. Moreover, even if our Board determines to pursue a specific strategic alternative, we expect that significant expenses will be involved in implementing any such strategic path, which will further reduce our existing capital. We may never achieve or sustain profitability as a business.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the completion of the ongoing investigator-sponsored clinical trials of ganetespib;\n\u2022 the costs involved in conducting preclinical activities for our ganetespib and HDC programs;\n\u2022 the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022 the extent to which we may elect to continue drug development activities in the future, if at all; and\n\u2022 the timing and completion of any transaction that may result from our ongoing strategic review.\nIf we decide to develop and commercialize our product candidates, we will need to obtain additional funding necessary to support our operations.\nAlthough we have raised substantial funding to date, if we decide to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, we will require additional funding in order to complete clinical development and conduct the research and development and clinical and regulatory activities necessary to bring such drug candidates to market.\nWe have not yet generated any product revenue and may never do so. We cannot predict whether and to what extent we may continue drug development activities, if at all, and what our future cash needs may be for any such activities. We expect our $66.6 million in cash resources as of December 31, 2015, along with significantly lower operating expenses following the termination of the GALAXY-2 trial, subsequent restructurings in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the discontinuation of a substantial portion of our research and development activities, will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. This estimate assumes no additional funding from new partnership agreements, equity financings or further sales under our at-the-market sales agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with Cowen and Company. The timing and nature of certain activities contemplated for the remainder of 2016 will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources. We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-206135) under which we have up to $300 million in securities available for future issuance, including up to $100 million in shares of common stock that we have reserved and that may be offered and sold under the ATM Agreement. However, pursuant to the instructions to Form S-3, we only have the ability to sell shares under the shelf registration statement, during any 12-month period, in an amount less than or equal to one-third of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates.\nOur operating plans may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need additional funds sooner than planned. For instance, we cannot predict whether and to what extent we may continue drug development activities. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nWe may seek the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, collaboration agreements, debt financings, or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders' ownership interests will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as\nincurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. For example, the terms of our loan and security agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation subject us to certain negative covenants including a prohibition on declaring or paying dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced corporate restructuring plans, and our restructuring activities may adversely affect our business.\nFollowing the termination for futility of the Phase 3 GALAXY-2 trial of ganetespib and to better align resources with our operational needs going forward, in November 2015, we announced the reduction of our workforce by approximately 60% to 33 full time employees. In February 2016, we committed to an additional reduction of our workforce from 33 full time employees to 10 full time employees and discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities. These reductions in force resulted in or will result in the loss of numerous long-term employees, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise and the reallocation of certain job responsibilities, all of which could adversely affect operational efficiencies, employee performance and retention. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key employees, establish and maintain agreements with competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-party contractors, our ability to advance our business or product candidates may be significantly impaired and our strategic goals and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nRestructuring plans may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in workforce and reduced employee morale, which may cause our employees who were not affected by the reduction in workforce to seek alternate employment. Furthermore, employees whose positions will be eliminated in connection with these restructuring plans may seek future employment with our competitors. Although all our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us at the time of hire, we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment. Additionally, as a result of our restructuring activities we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. If we cannot successfully manage the transition of our restructured operations, we may be unsuccessful in executing our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to continue to meet all applicable NASDAQ Global Market requirements and The NASDAQ Stock Market determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and harm our business.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements. On December 3, 2015, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ, that our common stock had not met the $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement for the last 30 consecutive business days pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) and that, if we were unable to demonstrate compliance with this requirement during the applicable grace periods, our common stock would be delisted after that time. The notification letter stated that pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) we would be afforded 180 calendar days, or until May 31, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of our common stock must maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance by May 31, 2016, NASDAQ will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be delisted. At that time, we may appeal\nNASDAQ's delisting determination to a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel. Alternatively, we may be eligible for an additional 180 day grace period if we satisfy all of the requirements, other than the minimum bid price requirement, for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5505. The closing bid price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market was $0.23 on March 10, 2016.\nWhile we intend to engage in efforts to regain compliance, and thus maintain our listing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance during the applicable time periods set forth above. If we fail to continue to meet all applicable NASDAQ Global Market requirements in the future and NASDAQ determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could substantially decrease trading in our common stock and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock; adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, if at all, for the continuation of our operations; and harm our business. Additionally, the market price of our common stock may decline further and stockholders may lose some or all of their investment.\nAny value which may be ascribed to Synta beyond our cash assets is currently dependent on the development of our HDC program, which, to date, has been limited.\nThe market capitalization of our company approximates our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Therefore any value for our stockholders above these cash assets is currently dependent on the potential development of the HDC program. Our most advanced product candidate from the HDC program, STA-12-8666, is currently in early stages of development. We intend to continue to conduct preclinical studies for STA-12-8666, but given the timing of our current strategic process as described herein, we do not currently plan to submit an investigational new drug application or initiate clinical development. Given the current early stage nature of STA-12-8666 the value ascribed to Synta in a strategic transaction beyond its cash assets may be limited.\nOur existing loan and security agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities. If we fail to comply with covenants in our loan and security agreements, we may be required to repay our indebtedness thereunder, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity.\nOn September 30, 2010, we entered into a $15 million loan and security agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation, or GECC, and one other lender, which we refer to herein as the GECC Term Loan. In March 2013, we amended the GECC Term Loan, obtaining $12.9 million in additional loan funding and, as a result, increasing the principal balance to $22.5 million at March 31, 2013. The GECC Term Loan is secured by substantially all of our assets, except our intellectual property. We have, however, granted GECC a springing security interest in our intellectual property in the event that we are not in compliance with certain cash burn covenants set forth in the agreement. In addition, the GECC Term Loan contains restrictive covenants, including the requirement for us to receive prior written consent of GECC to enter into loans, other than up to $4.0 million of equipment financing, restrictions on the declaration or payment of dividends, restrictions on acquisitions, and customary default provisions that include material adverse events, as defined therein. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in the declaration of an event of default that, if not cured or waived, may result in the acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding under the GECC Term Loan, which would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. If an event of default occurs, we may not be able to cure it within any applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nIn March 2011, we entered into a $2.0 million loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance Corporation, or Oxford, which we refer to as the Oxford Term Loan. In December 2012, we entered into a loan modification agreement under which we may draw down up to an additional $0.6 million in\nequipment financing until June 30, 2013, which has been fully utilized. The Oxford Term Loan is secured by certain laboratory and office equipment, furniture and fixtures. In connection with the Oxford Term Loan, Oxford and GECC entered into a Lien Subordination Agreement, whereby GECC granted Oxford a first priority perfected security interest in the loan collateral. The Oxford Term Loan contains restrictive covenants, including the requirement for us to receive the prior written consent of Oxford to enter into acquisitions in which we incur more than $2.0 million of related indebtedness, and customary default provisions that include material adverse events, as defined therein.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our key executives.\nThe competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense and we must retain and motivate highly qualified scientific personnel. We are highly dependent on Chen Schor, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Marc Schneebaum, our Chief Financial Officer, Wendy Rieder, our General Counsel, and certain other employees. All of the agreements with these individuals provide that employment is at-will and may be terminated by the employee at any time and without notice. The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our corporate objectives. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We do not maintain \"key person\" insurance on any of our employees. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Drug Candidates\nDespite the failure of ganetespib in the Phase 3 GALAXY-2 trial in NSCLC, ganetespib is still in clinical development for other cancer indications. As a result, we must continue to supply ganetespib drug product and maintain our safety data reporting systems.\nFollowing the failure of ganetespib in the GALAXY-2 clinical trial, we provided termination notice to most of the clinical trial sites where there were ongoing investigator-sponsored trials, or ISTs. However, we are contractually bound to continue supplying ganetespib drug product for two active and ongoing ISTs in ovarian cancer (GANNET53) and sarcoma (SARC 023). As a result, we must also maintain the safety data reporting systems required to collect adverse events and incur the costs associated therewith. In addition, we retain certain potential liability in the event that patients receiving ganetespib are harmed in connection with these ongoing trials.\nWe currently have only one product candidate in preclinical development. As we have closed our laboratory operations and no longer have the capability to discover new product candidates internally, we may not be able to overcome employee attrition without purchasing or relying on other sources for new product candidates.\nFollowing two workforce reductions in November 2015 and February 2016, we have closed our laboratory operations and discontinued a substantial portion of our research and development activities. Following these actions, we do not have internal discovery and research capabilities to identify and discover new product candidates. We have no current plan to resume discovery or research activities. If in the future we were to resume these activities, we would need to recruit additional scientific and technical personnel and obtain access to laboratory facilities.\nWe currently have only one product candidate in preclinical trials and, without internal discovery and research, we will not be able to expand our pipeline with internal candidates. If we are unable to expand our portfolio of product candidates through acquisitions or in-licensing, which we may be unable to do on reasonable terms or at all, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success may be largely dependent on the success of STA-12-8666 and any other HDC drug candidates that we may develop, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize any of these drug candidates.\nIf we do not enter into a strategic transaction, we anticipate that our success may be depend largely on the receipt of regulatory approval and successful commercialization of STA-12-8666 and any other HDC drug candidates we may develop. The future success of our drug candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022 our ability to recruit appropriate patients into our clinical trials and to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials to support regulatory approval;\n\u2022 our ability to provide acceptable evidence of their safety and efficacy;\n\u2022 receipt of marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and any similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 obtaining and maintaining commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers or establishing commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022 approval or use of competitive products in the indications for which we will market our drug candidates;\n\u2022 validation of the molecular targets or mechanisms of action of our drug candidates by us or by third parties;\n\u2022 approval of reimbursement in foreign countries with centralized health care; and\n\u2022 acceptance of any approved drug in the medical community and by patients and third-party payors.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to generate revenues through the sale of an approved product or through strategic collaborations based on our products.\nIf we do not obtain the required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our drug candidates.\nOur drug candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization. Performance of rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA is unpredictable but typically exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the drug candidate and the indication.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. In connection with the clinical trials of our drug candidates, we face risks that:\n\u2022 the drug candidate may not prove to be safe and effective;\n\u2022 the dosing of the drug candidate in a particular clinical trial may not be optimal;\n\u2022 patients may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the drug candidate being tested;\n\u2022 the results may not confirm the positive results of earlier clinical trials or preclinical studies; and\n\u2022 the results may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.\nOf the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a commercial product, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product.\nBecause our lead drug candidate is still in preclinical development, there is a high risk of failure, and we may never succeed in developing marketable products or generating product revenue.\nWe have no drug candidates that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale. We do not expect to have any commercial products on the market in the foreseeable future, if at all. We are exploring human diseases at the cellular level and attempting to develop drug candidates that intervene with cellular processes. Drug development is an uncertain process that involves trial and error, and we may fail at numerous stages along the way. Success in preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar results in humans during clinical trials, and successful results from early or small clinical trials of a drug candidate may not be replicated in later and larger clinical trials. Accordingly, the results from preclinical studies may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later stage clinical trials.\nIf clinical trials for our drug candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our drug candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.\nWe cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them. A number of events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our other ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell our drug candidates that are still in preclinical studies, including STA-12-8666 and any other HDC drug candidates that we may develop:\n\u2022 conditions imposed on us by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining, or our inability to obtain, required approvals from institutional review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\u2022 insufficient supply or deficient quality of our drug candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining regulatory agreement for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 slower or lower than anticipated enrollment and retention rate of subjects in clinical trials;\n\u2022 negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results, that necessitate additional clinical trials (for example, due to patient-to-patient pharmacokinetic variability, or due to changes in patient management and outcomes);\n\u2022 serious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in clinical trials; or\n\u2022 failure of our third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations to us.\nCommercialization of our drug candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of\nadditional supportive studies by the FDA or any foreign regulatory authority. In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the target patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials. Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond our expectations. In addition, the FDA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we have projected for any of our drug candidates. We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner. Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical power of the clinical trials.\nWe do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our drug candidates. In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our drug candidates could be limited. If approved, we may not receive a package insert for any of our products that are competitive and differentiated, which may change our strategies with respect to how and when we commercialize any of our products.\nIf we inadvertently fail to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs, we could be prevented from selling our drug candidates in foreign markets, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement for marketing our drug candidates outside the United States vary greatly from country to country and may require additional testing. We expect that our future clinical development of our drug candidates will involve a number of clinical trials in foreign jurisdictions, particularly in Europe. We have no experience in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals. The time required to obtain approvals outside the United States may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not guarantee approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our drug candidates and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur drug candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we fail to comply with continuing regulations, we could lose these approvals and the sale of any approved commercial products could be suspended.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular drug candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or previously unknown problems with any approved commercial products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes are discovered, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u2022 restrictions on the products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022 warning letters;\n\u2022 civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022 fines;\n\u2022 injunctions;\n\u2022 product seizures or detentions;\n\u2022 import bans;\n\u2022 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 total or partial suspension of production; and\n\u2022 refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drug candidates or supplements to approved applications.\nIf side effects or toxicities increase or are identified during the time our drug candidates are in development or after they are approved and on the market, we may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials, change the labeling or limit the scope of indication of any such products, or withdraw any such products from the market, any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues.\nWe have observed significant toxicities in preclinical animal studies of our clinical drug candidate, ganetespib. In clinical trials to date, we have not observed the serious liver and common ocular toxicities observed with first generation Hsp90 inhibitors.\nWe have observed a prolongation of the QTc interval in a Thorough QTc clinical study of ganetespib in healthy volunteers. This type of change in ECG tracings has been reported for a number of development-stage and approved oncology drugs, as well as drugs for other indications. The independent review also noted that the maximum mean change in QTcF (DDQTcF) from baseline of 21.5ms observed in the Thorough QTc clinical study places ganetespib in a zone of clinical ambiguity; it is not clear that this finding confers a substantial increased risk of torsades de pointes, a severe form of arrhythmia, in patients who are being treated with ganetespib for cancer. An independent review of the ganetespib clinical safety database in 2013 did not indicate an increased frequency or severity of cardiovascular adverse events in patients treated with ganetespib. We note that none of the 580 patients treated with ganetespib reviewed as part of this analysis had an adverse event of torsades de pointes reported. In addition, the independent review noted that the Thorough QTc study was conducted at a dose 33% higher than being evaluated in our ongoing combination studies; there was only one patient out of 45 that showed a QTc>450ms and no patients with a QTc>480ms; the number of outliers with change in QTc>30ms was low, only two subjects out of 45 (versus one subject in the placebo group, n=48); and there were no subjects with change in QTc>60ms. With enhanced ECG monitoring, we may find that the QTc prolongation effect of ganetespib treatment is more pronounced than we have observed to date. We may also find that the use of ganetespib in a larger number of patients may reveal an increase in the incidence or severity of cardiovascular adverse events.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for one or more of our drug candidates, as the drug is used in a larger patient population, if the incidence of side effects or toxicities increases or if other unacceptable effects are identified:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals;\n\u2022 we may be required to reformulate any such products, conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling of any such products, or implement changes to or obtain new approvals of our or our contractors' manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022 we may experience a significant drop in the sales of the affected products;\n\u2022 our reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and\n\u2022 we may become the target of lawsuits, including class action suits.\nAny of these events could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing any such products.\nWhile we choose to test our drug candidates in specific clinical indications based in part on our understanding of their mechanisms of action, our understanding may be incorrect or incomplete and, therefore, our drugs may not be effective against the diseases tested in our clinical trials.\nOur rationale for selecting the particular therapeutic indications for each of our drug candidates is based in part on our understanding of the mechanism of action of these drug candidates. However, our understanding of the drug candidate's mechanism of action may be incomplete or incorrect, or the mechanism may not be clinically relevant to the diseases treated. In such cases, our drug candidates may prove to be ineffective in the clinical trials for treating those diseases.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our nonclinical safety assessment studies, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established timelines for the completion of such clinical trials and studies.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials and certain nonclinical safety assessment studies, particularly those studies conducted under Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, for our drug candidates, and we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations, or CROs, medical institutions, and clinical investigators in the case of clinical trials, and CROs in the case of nonclinical safety assessment studies, to perform these functions. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. To date, our CROs and other similar entities with which we are working have performed well; however, if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected timelines, or comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be delayed in obtaining regulatory approvals for our drug candidates and may be delayed in our efforts to successfully commercialize our drug candidates for targeted diseases.\nWe have no manufacturing capacity and depend on third-party manufacturers to produce our drug supplies.\nWe do not currently operate manufacturing facilities or testing facilities for any of our preclinical drug candidates. We have limited experience in drug manufacturing, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our drug candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We continue to provide limited ganetespib drug supply for the clinical trials in ovarian cancer (GANNET53) and sarcoma (SARC 023). We still rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture, test, supply, store, and distribute drug supplies for these clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could interrupt on-going clinical trials, delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our drug candidates or commercialization of any approved products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nOur drug candidates require precise, high quality manufacturing. Failure by our contract manufacturers to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in testing or delivery, cost overruns, or other problems that could seriously hurt our business. Contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control, and quality assurance. These manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, or cGMPs, and other applicable U.S. and foreign government regulations and standards. We periodically audit our contract manufacturers responsible for supplying our clinical drug materials and have put quality agreements in place that we believe are appropriate for our materials. However, we do not have direct control over third party manufacturers' compliance with cGMPs and other standards and therefore, cannot provide assurance regarding such compliance.\nIf for some reason our contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be unable to replace such third-party manufacturers in a timely manner and the production of our drug candidates would be interrupted, resulting in delays in clinical trials and additional costs. Switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement manufacturer after our drug candidates are approved. Such approval would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our drug candidates after receipt of FDA approval. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms quickly, or at all.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for any of our drug candidates.\nTo date, our drug candidates have been manufactured in relatively small quantities for preclinical testing and clinical trials by third-party manufacturers. If the FDA or other regulatory agencies approve any of our drug candidates for commercial sale, we expect that we would continue to rely, at least initially, on third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of such approved drug candidates. These manufacturers may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our approved drug candidates in a timely or economic manner, or at all. Significant scale-up of manufacturing and increased production may require additional validation studies, which the FDA or other regulatory authorities must review and approve. If our third-party manufacturers are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a drug candidate, or we are unable to establish our own manufacturing capabilities, the commercial launch of any approved products may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our drug candidates, we may be unable to generate product revenue.\nWe do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize and market any of our products that may be approved by the FDA, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial, and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and we may not become profitable.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf our patent position does not adequately protect our drug candidates or any future products, others could compete against us more directly, which would harm our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities, as appropriate, to develop and maintain our proprietary position.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent position as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, drug candidates, and any future products in the United States and other countries. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our\nbusiness and ability to achieve profitability. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, drug candidates, and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nIn addition, although we do not believe that any of the patents or patent applications that we currently license are material to our business, we may in the future license intellectual property that is material to us. In such cases, we may be dependent upon the licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for the licensed intellectual property. These licensors may not successfully prosecute patent applications or may fail to maintain issued patents. The licensors may also determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that infringe the patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. If any of the foregoing occurs, and the terms of any such future license do not allow us to assume control of patent prosecution, maintenance and enforcement, any competitive advantage we may have due to the license may be diminished or eliminated.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022 we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u2022 we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022 others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022 any of our or our licensors' pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022 any of our or our licensors' patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u2022 any patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022 we will develop additional proprietary technologies or drug candidates that are patentable; or\n\u2022 the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough third parties may challenge our rights to, or the scope or validity of our patents, to date we have not received any communications from third parties challenging our patents or patent applications covering our drug candidates.\nWe typically file for patent protection first on the composition-of-matter of our drug candidates and also claim their activities and methods for their production and use to the extent known at that time. As we learn more about the mechanisms of action and new methods of manufacture and use of these drug candidates, we generally file additional patent applications for these new inventions. Although our patents may prevent others from making, using, or selling similar products, they do not ensure that we will not infringe the patent rights of third parties. For example, because we sometimes identify the mechanism of action or molecular target of a given drug candidate after identifying its composition-of-matter and therapeutic use, we may not be aware until the mechanism or target is further elucidated that a third party has an issued or pending patent claiming biological activities or\ntargets that may cover our drug candidate. If such a patent exists or is granted in the future, we cannot provide assurances that a license will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement would require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our drug candidates.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing upon the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and enforcing our own patents and proprietary rights against others. Certain of our research and development programs are in highly competitive fields in which numerous third parties have issued patents and patent applications with claims closely related to the subject matter of our programs. We are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or claims by third parties that our drug candidates, technologies or methods infringe their intellectual property.\nHowever, while it is our practice to conduct freedom to operate searches and analyses, we cannot guarantee that we have identified every patent or patent application that may be relevant to the research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates. In the case of patent applications, we assess the likelihood of claims in pending, third party patent applications being allowed which may interfere with our freedom to operate relative to our drug candidates. We cannot provide assurances that our assessments in this regard will be correct and that patent claims covering our drug candidates that were assessed a low likelihood of issuance by us will not issue to a third party in the future. Moreover, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert against us patents that we believe are not infringed by us or are invalid.\nIn the event of a successful infringement action against us with respect to any third party patent rights, we may be required to:\n\u2022 pay substantial damages;\n\u2022 stop developing, commercializing, and selling the infringing drug candidates or approved products;\n\u2022 stop utilizing the infringing technologies and methods in our drug candidates or approved products;\n\u2022 develop non-infringing products, technologies, and methods; and\n\u2022 obtain one or more licenses from other parties, which could result in our paying substantial royalties or our granting of cross licenses to our technologies.\nWe may not be able to obtain licenses from other parties at a reasonable cost, or at all. If we are not able to obtain necessary licenses at a reasonable cost, or at all, we could encounter substantial delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative technologies, methods, and products, which we may not be able to accomplish.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we have previously been subject to a claim by an alleged competitor that a prospective employee we sought to hire was bound by an ongoing non-competition obligation which prevented us from hiring this employee. We may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or prospective employees are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe may not be able to keep up with the rapid technological change in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, which could make any future approved products obsolete and reduce our revenue.\nBiotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change. Our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages in our drug discovery process that we believe we derive from our research approach and proprietary technologies. In addition, any future products that we develop, including our clinical drug candidates, may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing those products, which may require that we raise additional funds to continue our operations.\nOur market is subject to intense competition. If we are unable to compete effectively, our drug candidates may be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete.\nWe are engaged in segments of the pharmaceutical industry that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of novel drugs that target cancer. We face, and expect to continue to face, intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. In addition to currently approved drugs, there are a significant number of drugs that are currently under development and may become available in the future for the treatment of cancer. We would expect our drug candidates to compete with marketed drugs and potentially with drug candidates currently under development.\nMany of our competitors have:\n\u2022 significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and may be better equipped to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize drug candidates;\n\u2022 more extensive experience in preclinical testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products;\n\u2022 drug candidates that have been approved or are in late-stage clinical development; and/or\n\u2022 collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions.\nCompetitive products may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our drug candidates. Furthermore, the development of new treatment methods and/or the widespread adoption or increased utilization of any vaccine for the diseases we are targeting could render our drug candidates noncompetitive, obsolete or uneconomical. If we successfully develop and obtain approval for our drug candidates, we will face competition based on the safety and effectiveness of our drug candidates, the timing of their entry into the market in relation to competitive products in development, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent position and other factors. If we successfully develop drug candidates but those drug candidates do not achieve and maintain market acceptance, our business will not be successful.\nIf approved, STA-12-8666, may compete with the currently approved therapies for the treatment of cancers, and other cancer treatments under development. In particular, STA-12-8666 may compete with irinotecan and other novel formulations or approaches including antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) intended to improve the activity of irinotecan or its active metabolite SN-38. These include: Etirinotecan pegol, being developed by Nektar Therapeutics, MM-398, being developed by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, CRLX101 being developed by Cerulean Pharma, NK012, being developed by Nippon Kayaku Co., HA-irinotecan being developed by Alchemia, IMMU-130 and IMMU-132, being developed by Immunomedics, BEL-0222, being developed by Belrose Pharma, PEG-SN-38 conjugate, being developed by Prolynx LLC, and IT-141, being developed by Intezyne, among others. In general, therapies from the HDC program, if approved, may compete with approved products and agents in development stemming from approaches that are designed to preferentially increase tumor exposure to an anticancer agent. These may include approved products and/or products that arise from various liposomal and nanoparticle delivery approaches and antibody drug conjugate (ADC) platforms, among others.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to leverage our experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization to:\n\u2022 discover and develop on a timely-basis medicines that are superior to other products in the market;\n\u2022 attract high-quality scientific, product development, and commercial personnel;\n\u2022 obtain patent and/or proprietary protection for our medicines and technologies;\n\u2022 obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 selectively commercialize certain drug candidates in indications treated by specialist physicians; and\n\u2022 selectively partner with pharmaceutical companies in the development and commercialization of certain drug candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and the market price of our common stock may drop.\nPrior to our February 2007 initial public offering, there was not a public market for our common stock. There is a limited history on which to gauge the volatility of our stock price; however, since our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Market in February 2007, our stock price has fluctuated from a low of $0.29 to a high of $11.88. Furthermore, the stock market has experienced\nsignificant volatility, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences company stocks. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022 results of clinical trials conducted by others on drugs that would compete with our drug candidates;\n\u2022 failure or delays in advancing STA-12-8666 or any other HDC drug candidates that we may develop, or other drug candidates that we may discover or acquire in the future, into clinical trials;\n\u2022 results of clinical trials conducted by other pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and life sciences companies on drugs that would compete with our drug candidates;\n\u2022 failure or discontinuation of any of our research programs;\n\u2022 potential for merger or acquisition;\n\u2022 key personnel changes;\n\u2022 issues in manufacturing our drug candidates or approved products;\n\u2022 regulatory developments or enforcement in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022 introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any cover our common stock;\n\u2022 public concern over our drug candidates or any approved products;\n\u2022 litigation;\n\u2022 general market conditions;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 failure of any of our drug candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022 economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises;\n\u2022 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and\n\u2022 overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets.\nThese and other external factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline and impede our ability to raise capital.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 18.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nSales into the public market by our officers, directors and their affiliates, or other major stockholders, of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation that such sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, certain of our executive officers may establish predetermined selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, for the purpose of effecting sales of common stock.\nIf any such sales occur, are expected to occur or a large number of our shares are sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nInsiders have substantial control over us which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management and/or the board of directors.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 18.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock. These stockholders, if acting together, may have the ability to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these persons, acting together, may have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022 delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control;\n\u2022 entrenching our management and/or the board of directors;\n\u2022 impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022 discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nProvisions of our charter, bylaws, and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nThese provisions:\n\u2022 allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022 establish a classified board of directors, providing that not all members of the board of directors be elected at one time;\n\u2022 authorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval blank check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a \"poison pill\" to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022 require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022 establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 limit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022 require the approval of the holders of 80% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order to amend certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends, and accordingly, our stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, we are currently prohibited from making a dividend payment under the terms of our loan and security agreement with GECC. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 91832, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MDGL"}
