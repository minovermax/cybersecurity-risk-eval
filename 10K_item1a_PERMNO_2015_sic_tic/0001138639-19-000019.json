{"cik": "1138639", "company": "INFINERA Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk and a description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, perhaps significantly.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits expected from the Acquisition.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition or fail to realize such benefits in the anticipated time frame after the completion of the Acquisition. Our ability to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the Acquisition will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine our business with Coriant\u2019s business in a manner that facilitates growth, realizes anticipated cost savings and retains Coriant\u2019s and our customers, suppliers and employees. We must successfully combine our business with the business of Coriant in a manner that enables these anticipated benefits to be realized and we must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting the combined company's revenue base. Failure to achieve all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated synergies related to the Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to realize significant synergies from cost savings, including from consolidation of the combined company's supply chain, operational scale efficiencies throughout the combined company and our ability to integrate our optical engine into key Coriant products. We also expect to incur material one-time costs to achieve these synergies. While we believe these synergies are achievable, our ability to achieve such estimated synergies in the amounts and time frame expected is subject to various assumptions by our management based on expectations that are subject to a number of risks, which may or may not be realized, as well as the incurrence of other costs in our operations that may offset all or a portion of such synergies and other factors outside our control. As a consequence, we may not be able to realize all of these synergies within the time frame expected or at all, or the amounts of such synergies could be significantly reduced, and we may incur additional and/or unexpected costs to realize these synergies. In addition, if we fail to achieve the anticipated cost benefits throughout the supply chain or integrating our optical engine in key Coriant products in a timely manner, we may be unable realize all the anticipated synergies. Failure to achieve the expected synergies could significantly reduce the expected benefits associated with the Acquisition and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate Coriant\u2019s business and realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition.\nWe will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business and operations of Coriant. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe loss of customers or suppliers of ours or of Coriant as a result of such parties deciding not to continue business at the same or similar levels with us after the Acquisition;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with operating the combined business in markets and geographies in which we have not historically operated in;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating our direct sales and distribution channels with Coriant\u2019s to effectively sell the products and services of the combined company following the closing of the Acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe complexities associated with managing our company and integrating personnel from Coriant, resulting in a significantly larger combined company, while at the same time providing high quality products to customers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating accounting, information technology, communications, administration and other systems;\n\u2022\nchallenges with re-negotiating pricing with key suppliers for more favorable terms;\n\u2022\nthe failure to identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming functions and assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty addressing possible differences in corporate culture and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nthe failure to retain key employees of the combined company;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Acquisition; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by integrating Coriant\u2019s operations.\nAn inability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the Acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have a material adverse effect on the revenue, gross margin, level of operating expenses and overall results of operations of the combined company, which may materially adversely affect the value of our stock.\nThe actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of our plan for integration may not be realized. Actual synergies, if achieved at all, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. For example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from the Acquisition may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies. In addition, since Coriant's operations are more widely distributed around the globe than our current operations, it may take longer to integrate the various functions and divert management\u2019s time more than anticipated. If we are not able to adequately address these challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate Coriant\u2019s operations into our own or, even if we are able to combine the two business operations successfully, to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies. Although our integration plan involves us making significant cash outlays to transform the business, if the integration does not generate the returns we anticipate, it could cause us to decrease our cash and investment position. This may cause customers to lose confidence in our business and make them reluctant to continue to do business with us.\nOur business relationships, those of Coriant or the combined company may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Acquisition.\nParties with which we or Coriant do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Acquisition, including with respect to current or future product roadmaps of the combined company. Our and Coriant\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption, as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, and others may seek to receive confirmation that their existing business relations with us or Coriant, as the case may be, will not be adversely impacted as a result of the Acquisition or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than the combined company as a result of the Acquisition. For example, a number of Coriant\u2019s customers deferred purchase orders with Coriant pending announcement of a strategic transaction, and there can be no assurance that all of those customers will ultimately submit such purchase orders. Any such failure to submit such purchase orders, or any of these other disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations and could also have an adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition. The risks and adverse effects of such disruptions could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting for the combined companies, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements.\nWe and Coriant currently maintain separate internal control over financial reporting with different financial reporting processes and different enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems. We plan to integrate our internal control over financial reporting and move the combined companies to a single ERP system. We may encounter difficulties and unanticipated issues in combining our respective accounting systems due to the complexity of the business processes. In addition, Coriant as a private company has not historically had to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and their accounting systems and processes will need to be integrated and in compliance in 2019. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting of the combined company, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may decline.\nCoriant may have liabilities that are not known, probable or estimable at this time.\nAs a result of the Acquisition, Coriant has become our subsidiary and remains subject to its past, current and future liabilities (other than indebtedness discharged in connection with the Acquisition). There could be unasserted claims or assessments against or affecting Coriant, including the failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, orders and consent decrees or infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property or other proprietary rights that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of Coriant. In addition, there are liabilities of Coriant that are neither probable nor estimable at this time that may become probable or estimable in the future, including indemnification requests received from customers of Coriant relating to claims of infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectuaal property or other proprietary rights, tax liabilities arising in connection with ongoing or future tax audits and liabilities in connection with other past, current and future legal claims and litigation. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We may learn additional information about Coriant that adversely affects us, such as unknown, unasserted, or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws or infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property or other proprietary rights (including related indemnity requests from customers).\nAs a result of the Acquisition, Infinera and Coriant may be unable to retain key employees.\nOur success after the Acquisition will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees of ours and Coriant. Key employees may depart because of a variety of reasons relating to the Acquisition. If we and Coriant are unable to retain key personnel who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the combined company, we could face disruptions in our operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs. In addition, the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition.\nWe may be unable to generate the cash flow necessary to service the 2024 Notes or to make anticipated capital expenditures.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service the $402.5 million of 2.125% convertible senior notes due September 1, 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d) or to make anticipated capital expenditures. For example, in the first quarter after the Acquisition, the combined company had a net loss and negative cash flows. In addition, we expect to incur losses over the next few quarters as we integrate the two companies. Our ability to pay our expenses, satisfy the 2024 Notes and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by general economic, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, and our ability to realize synergies and anticipated cost savings. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service the 2024 Notes or to make anticipated capital expenditures, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures or obtain additional financing. For additional risk related to the 2024 Notes, please see \u201cRisk Related to our 2024 Notes\u201d below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Common Stock\nOur quarterly results may vary significantly from period to period, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations.\nOur quarterly results, in particular, our revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, operating margins and net income (loss), have historically varied from period to period and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Our budgeted expense levels are based, in large part, on our expectations of future revenue and the development efforts associated with that future revenue. Consequently, if our revenue does not meet projected levels in the short-term, our inventory levels, cost of goods sold and operating expenses would be high relative to revenue, resulting in potential operating losses. For example, in each of the prior eight quarters, we have had operating losses, largely as a result of lower than expected revenue and gross margins.\nFactors that may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly results, many of which are outside our control and may be difficult to predict, include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand, sales cycles and prices for products and services, including discounts given in response to competitive pricing pressures, as well as the timing of purchases by our key customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate our operations with Coriant's operations and realize the anticipated synergies related to the Acquisition;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets for optical transport network purchases and changes or variability in their purchasing cycles;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our customer, product or geographic mix, including the impact of new customer deployments, which typically carry lower gross margins, and customer consolidation, which may affect our ability to grow revenue;\n\u2022\nthe timing and acceptance of our new product releases and our competitors' new product releases;\n\u2022\nhow quickly, or whether at all, the markets in which we operate adopt our solutions;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase volumes and yields on products manufactured in our internal manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully restructure our operations within our anticipated timeframe and realize our anticipated savings;\n\u2022\nthe quality and timing of delivery of key components from suppliers;\n\u2022\norder cancellations, reductions or delays in delivery schedules by our customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs and availability of components we purchase for our products;\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the competitive dynamics of the markets we serve, including any new entrants, new technologies, or customer or competitor consolidation;\n\u2022\nreadiness of customer sites for installation of our products as well as the availability of third party suppliers to provide contract engineering and installation services for us;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;\n\u2022\nany future changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) or new interpretations of existing accounting rules, including Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe impact of a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, severe weather, or tsunami or other flooding, as well as interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities such as water and electricity, in a key location such as our Northern California facilities, which is located near major earthquake fault lines and in a designated flood zone; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in domestic and international markets.\nMany factors affecting our results of operations are beyond our control and make it difficult to predict our results for a particular quarter and beyond. If our revenue or operating results do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts or fall below any guidance we provide to the market, the price of our common stock may decline substantially.\nAny delays in the development and introduction of our new products or in releasing enhancements to our existing products may harm our business.\nBecause our products are based on complex technologies, including, in many cases, the development of next-generation PICs and specialized ASICs (key components of our optical engines), we may experience unanticipated delays in developing, improving, manufacturing or deploying these products. The development process for our optical engines is lengthy, and any modifications entail significant development cost and risks.\nAt any given time, various new product introductions and enhancements to our existing products are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment. We rely on third parties, some of which are relatively early stage companies, to develop, manufacture and deliver components for our next-generation products, which can often require custom development. The development process from laboratory prototype to customer trials, and subsequently to general availability, involves a significant number of simultaneous efforts. These efforts often must be completed in a timely and coordinated manner so that they may be incorporated into the product development cycle for our systems, and include:\n\u2022\ncompletion of product development, including the development and completion of our next-generation optical engines, and the completion of associated module development;\n\u2022\nthe qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components;\n\u2022\nvalidation of manufacturing methods and processes;\n\u2022\nextensive quality assurance and reliability testing and staffing of testing infrastructure;\n\u2022\nvalidation of software; and\n\u2022\nestablishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements.\nEach of these steps, in turn, presents risks of failure, rework or delay, any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of our products. New generations of our optical engines as well as intensive software testing are important to the timely introduction of new products and enhancements to our existing products, and are subject to these development risks. In addition, unexpected intellectual property disputes, failure of critical design elements, limited or constrained engineering resources, and a host of other development execution risks may delay, or even prevent, the introduction of new products or enhancements to our existing products. If we do not develop and successfully introduce or enhance products in a timely manner, our competitive position will suffer.\nAdditionally, as a result of the Acquisition, significant development effort is in progress to enhance our end-to-end product portfolio, including the newly added Coriant products, with network management and network automation software and features that would enable our current and future potential customers to deploy networks easily and take advantage of features such as IB. This effort may not bear the expected results and benefits to our current and future potential customers and we may not realize the financial and strategic benefits to our business.\nAs we transition customers to new products, we face significant risk that our new products may not be accepted by our current or new customers. To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products that are adopted by customers, we could fail to obtain an adequate return on these investments and could lose\nmarket share to our competitors, which could be difficult or impossible to regain. Similarly, we may face decreased revenue, gross margins and profitability due to a rapid decline in sales of current products as customers hold spending to focus purchases on new product platforms. We could incur significant costs in completing the transition, including costs of inventory write-downs of the current product as customers transition to new product platforms. In addition, products or technologies developed by others may render our products noncompetitive or obsolete and result in significant reduction in orders from our customers and the loss of existing and prospective customers.\nOur ability to increase our revenue will depend upon continued growth of demand by consumers and businesses for additional network capacity and on the level and timing of capital spending by our customers.\nOur future success depends on factors that increase the amount of data transmitted over communications networks and the growth of optical transport networks to meet the increased demand for optical capacity. These factors include the growth of mobile, video and cloud-based services, increased broadband connectivity and the continuing adoption of high-capacity, revenue-generating services. If demand for such bandwidth does not continue, or slows down, the market for optical transport networking equipment may not continue to grow and our product sales would be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, demand for our products depends on the level and timing of capital spending in optical networks by service providers as they construct, expand and upgrade the capacity of their optical networks. Capital spending is cyclical in our industry and spending by customers can change on short notice. Any future decisions by our customers to reduce capital spending, whether caused by lower customer demand or weakening economic conditions, changes in government regulations relating to telecommunications and data networks, customer consolidation or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on a small number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue from period to period and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our key customers would reduce our revenue and harm our operating results.\nWhile our revenue and customer base will diversify as part of the Acquisition, today a relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of our revenue from period to period. For example, for fiscal year 2018 our top five customers accounted for approximately 42% of our total revenue. For fiscal year 2017, our top five customers accounted for approximately 44% of our total revenue. Included in these five customers for fiscal year 2017 is one customer that completed a merger in late 2017, which was a combination of two of our historically larger customers. For fiscal year 2016, our top five customers accounted for approximately 46% of our total revenue. Our business will likely be harmed if any of our key customers are acquired, do not generate as much revenue as we forecast, stop purchasing from us, delay anticipated product purchases, or substantially reduce their orders to us. In addition, our business will be harmed if we fail to maintain our competitive advantage with our key customers or do not add new larger customers over time. We continue to expect a relatively small number of customers to continue to account for a large percentage of revenue from period to period. However, customer consolidation could reduce the number of key customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenue and may increase the risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers.\nOur ability to continue to generate revenue from our key customers will depend on our ability to maintain strong relationships with these customers and introduce competitive new products at competitive prices, and we may not be successful at doing so. In most cases, our sales are made to these customers pursuant to standard purchase agreements rather than long-term purchase commitments, and orders may be canceled or reduced readily. In the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order, we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business. Our operating results will continue to depend on our ability to sell our products to our key customers.\nIncreased consolidation among our customers and suppliers in the communications networking industry has and could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have seen increased consolidation in the communications networking industry over the past few years, which has adversely affected our business and results of operations. For example several of our customers have consolidated, during 2016, Charter Communications completed its acquisition of Time Warner Cable, Inc. and Altice completed its acquisition of Cablevision, and during 2017, Verizon completed its acquisition of XO Communications and CenturyLink completed its acquisition of Level 3 Communications. Customer consolidation has led to changes in buying patterns, slowdowns in spending, redeployment of existing equipment and re-architecture of parts of existing networks or future networks, as the combined companies evaluate the needs of the combined business. Moreover, the significant purchasing power of these large companies can increase pricing and competitive pressures for us, including the potential for decreases in our average selling prices. If one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide it with products or relies on another provider of similar products, we may lose that customer\u2019s business. Such consolidation may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenue and may exacerbate the risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. Any of the foregoing results will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our suppliers in the communications networking industry have recently begun to consolidate. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, Lumentum completed its acquisition of Oclaro, and II-VI announced its intention to acquire Finisar. Supplier consolidation may lead to increased prices of components for our products, deployment delays and/or a disruption in output. In addition, such consolidation may exacerbate the risks relating to our dependence on a small number of suppliers.\nOur gross margin may fluctuate from period to period and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur gross margin fluctuates from period to period and varies by customer and by product. Over the past eight fiscal quarters, our gross margin has ranged from 24.1% to 40.5%. Our gross margin is likely to continue to fluctuate and will be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe mix of the types of customers purchasing our products as well as the product mix, including sales of lower margin Coriant products;\n\u2022\nthe initial products released powered by our next-generation technologies generate lower margin initially, as per unit production costs for initial units tend to be higher and experience more variability in production yields;\n\u2022\nthe pace at which we deploy solutions powered by our next generation technologies, which could lead to higher excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u2022\nsignificant new deployments to existing and new customers, often with a higher portion of lower margin common equipment as we deploy network footprint;\n\u2022\naggressive pricing tactics by our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our manufacturing costs, including fluctuations in yields and production volumes;\n\u2022\npricing and commercial terms designed to secure long-term customer relationships, as well as commercial deals to transition certain customers to our new products;\n\u2022\nconsolidation amongst our suppliers, which may increase prices of components for our products;\n\u2022\nthe volume of IB-enabled solutions sold, and capacity licenses activated;\n\u2022\nprice discounts negotiated by our customers;\n\u2022\ncharges for excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price or availability of components for our products, including the possible effect of new or increased tariffs on the prices of raw materials used in such components; and\n\u2022\nchanges in warranty related costs.\nIt is likely that the average unit prices of our products will decrease over time in response to competitive pricing pressures. In addition, some of our customer contracts contain clauses that require us to annually decrease the sales price of our products to these customers. In response, we will need to reduce the cost of our products through manufacturing efficiencies, design improvements and cost reductions from our supply partners. If these efforts are not successful or if we are unable to reduce our costs by more than the reduction in the price of our products, our gross margin will decline, causing our operating results to decline. Fluctuations in gross margin may make it difficult to manage our business and achieve or maintain profitability.\nAggressive business tactics by our competitors may harm our business.\nThe markets in which we compete are extremely competitive and this often results in aggressive business tactics by our competitors, including:\n\u2022\naggressively pricing their optical transport products and other portfolio products, including offering significant one-time discounts and guaranteed future price decreases;\n\u2022\noffering optical products at a substantial discount or for free when bundled together with broader technology purchases, such as router or wireless equipment purchases;\n\u2022\nproviding financing, marketing and advertising assistance to customers; and\n\u2022\ninfluencing customer requirements to emphasize different product capabilities, which better suit their products.\nThe level of competition and pricing pressure tend to increase when competing for larger high-profile opportunities or during periods of economic weakness when there are fewer network build-out projects. If we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or if our current or future competitors continue or expand their aggressive business tactics, including those described above, demand for our products could decline, we could experience delays or cancellations of customer orders, and/or we could be required to reduce our prices to compete in the market.\nActions that we are taking to restructure our business to cut costs in order to align our operating structure with current opportunities may not be as effective as anticipated.\nIn December 2018, we implemented a restructuring initiative (the \u201c2018 Restructuring Plan\u201d) as part of a comprehensive review of our operations and ongoing integration synergies in order to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiencies and address redundancies following the Acquisition. As part of the 2018 Restructuring Plan, we hope to reduce expenses, streamline the organization, and reallocate resources to align more closely with our needs going forward. While we expect to realize efficiencies from these actions, these activities might not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits we expect. Further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated. In addition, as a result of the restructuring, our ability to execute on product development, address key market opportunities and/or meet customer demand, could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional qualified personnel when needed, our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, and finance personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. For example, senior members of our engineering team have unique technical experience that would be difficult to replace. We do not have long-term employment contracts or key person life insurance covering any of our key personnel. Because our products are complex, we must hire and retain highly trained customer service and support personnel to ensure that the deployment of our products does not result in network disruption for our customers. We believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense in our industry, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we are headquartered. We may not succeed in identifying, attracting and retaining appropriate personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to identify, attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, particularly engineers and sales personnel, could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives, such as timely product introductions. In addition, as a result of the Acquisition, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their futures that may impair our ability to retain, recruit or motivate key management, engineering, technical and other personnel.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nCompetition in the packet-optical equipment market is intense. Our main competitors include WDM system suppliers, such as Adva, Ciena, Cisco, ECI, Huawei, Nokia and ZTE. In addition, there are several other companies that offer one or more products that partially compete with our offerings.\nCompetition in the markets we serve is based on any one or a combination of the following factors:\n\u2022\nprice and other commercial terms;\n\u2022\nfunctionality;\n\u2022\nexisting business and customer relationships;\n\u2022\nthe ability of products and services to meet customers\u2019 immediate and future network requirements;\n\u2022\npower consumption;\n\u2022\nheat dissipation;\n\u2022\nform factor or density;\n\u2022\ninstallation and operational simplicity;\n\u2022\nquality and reliability;\n\u2022\nservice and support;\n\u2022\nsecurity and encryption requirements;\n\u2022\nscalability and investment protection; and\n\u2022\nproduct lead times.\nIn addition to our current competitors, other companies have, or may in the future develop, products that are or could be competitive with our products. We also could encounter competitor consolidation in the markets in which we compete, which could lead to a changing competitive landscape, capabilities and market share, and could impact our results of operations.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition, technical, financial and marketing resources, and better established relationships with potential customers than we have. Many of our competitors\nhave more resources and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies, and in creating market awareness for those products and technologies. In addition, many of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively. Further, many of our competitors have built long-standing relationships with some of our prospective and existing customers and have the ability to provide financing to customers and could, therefore, have an inherent advantage in selling products to those customers.\nWe also compete with low-cost producers that can increase pricing pressure on us and a number of smaller companies that provide competition for a specific product, customer segment or geographic market. In addition, we may also face increased competition from system and component companies that develop products based on off-the-shelf hardware that offers the latest commercially available technologies. Due to the narrower focus of their efforts, these competitors may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly than we can and may provide attractive alternatives to our customers.\nWe must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful.\nThe optical transport networking equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. We continually invest in research and development to sustain or enhance our existing products, but the introduction of new communications technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or requirements could render our products obsolete. Further, in developing our products, we have made, and will continue to make, assumptions with respect to which standards or requirements will be adopted by our customers and competitors. If the standards or requirements adopted by our prospective customers are different from those on which we have focused our efforts, market acceptance of our products would be reduced or delayed, and our business would be harmed.\nWe are continuing to invest a significant portion of our research and development efforts in the development of our next-generation products. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their existing products and introduce new products and technologies and to influence customers\u2019 buying criteria so as to emphasize product capabilities that we do not, or may not, possess. To be competitive, we must anticipate future customer requirements and continue to invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. If we do not anticipate these future customer requirements and invest in the technologies necessary to enable us to have and to sell the appropriate solutions, it may limit our competitive position and future sales, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not have sufficient resources to make these investments and we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive.\nThe manufacturing process for our PICs and certain components of our products, and the assembly of our finished products, is very complex. The partial or complete loss of any of our manufacturing facilities, a reduction in yields of our PICs or an inability to scale capacity to meet customer demands could harm our business.\nThe manufacturing process for our PICs and certain components of our products, and the assembly of our finished products, is very complex. In the event that any of our manufacturing facilities utilized to build these components and assemble our finished products were fully or partially destroyed, or shut down, as a result of a natural disaster, work stoppage or otherwise, it would limit our ability to sell our products. Because of the complex nature of our manufacturing facilities, such loss would take a considerable amount of time to repair or replace. The partial or complete loss of any of our manufacturing facilities, or an event causing the interruption in our use of any such facilities, whether as a result of a natural disaster, work stoppage or otherwise, for any extended period of time would cause our business, financial condition and operating results to be harmed.\nMinor deviations in the PIC manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yields and, in some cases, cause production to be suspended. In the past, we have had significant variances in our PIC yields, including production interruptions and suspensions and may have continued yield variances, including additional interruptions or suspensions in the future. Lower than expected yields from our PIC manufacturing process or defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our products could limit our ability to satisfy customer demand requirements, and could damage customer relations and cause business reputation problems, harming our business and operating results.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could harm our relationships with our customers, our business and our results of operations.\nOur large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may cause us to agree to terms and conditions that result in decreased revenue due to lower average selling prices and potentially increased cost of sales leading to lower gross margin, all of which would harm our results of operations.\nMany of our customers are large service providers that have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. In addition, customer consolidation in the past few years has created combined companies that are even larger and have greater negotiating leverage. Our customers have and may continue to seek advantageous pricing, payment and other commercial terms. We have and may continue to agree to unfavorable commercial terms with these customers, including the potential of reducing the average selling price of our products, increasing cost of sales or agreeing to extended payment terms in response to these commercial requirements or competitive pricing pressures. To maintain acceptable operating results, we will need to comply with these commercial terms, develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, and continue to reduce our costs.\nWe are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, and if we fail to obtain these components on a timely basis, we will not meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements.\nWe currently purchase several key components for our products from sole or limited sources. In particular, we rely on our own production of certain components of our products, such as PICs, and on third parties, including sole source and limited source suppliers, for certain of the components of our products, including ASICs, field-programmable gate arrays, processors, and other semiconductor and optical components. We have increased our reliance on third parties to develop and manufacture components for certain products, some of which require custom development. We purchase most of these components on a purchase order basis and only have long-term contracts with these sole source or limited source suppliers. If any of our sole source or limited source suppliers suffer from capacity constraints, lower than expected yields, deployment delays, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule which could result in lost revenue, additional product costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. Further, our suppliers could enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, refuse to sell their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all, go out of business or discontinue their relationships with us. We may be unable to develop alternative sources for these components.\nThe loss of a source of supply, or lack of sufficient availability of key components, could require us to redesign products that use such components, which could result in lost revenue, additional product costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. In addition, if our contract manufacturers do not receive critical components in a timely manner to build our products, then we would not be able to ship in a timely manner and would, therefore, be unable to meet our prospective customers\u2019 product delivery requirements. In the past, we have experienced delivery delays because of lack of availability of components or reliability issues with components that we were purchasing. In addition, some of our suppliers have gone out of business, merged with another supplier, or limited their supply of components to us, which may cause us to experience longer than normal lead times, supply delays and increased prices. We may in the future experience a shortage of certain components as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers, strong demand in the industry for such components, or other disruptions in our supply chain. In addition, disruptions to global macroeconomic conditions may create pressure on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and manufacturing capacity. These supplier disruptions may continue to occur in the future, which could limit our ability to produce our products and cause us to fail to meet a customer\u2019s delivery requirements. Any failure to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements could harm our reputation and our customer relationships, either of which would harm our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements or customer demand, we could incur additional costs, including inventory write-downs or equipment write-offs, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe generate forecasts of future demand for our products several months prior to the scheduled delivery to our prospective customers. This requires us to make significant investments before we know if corresponding revenue will be recognized. Lead times for materials and components, including ASICs, that we need to order for the manufacture of our products vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. In the past, we have experienced lengthening in lead times for certain components. If the lead times for components are lengthened, we may be required to purchase increased levels of such components to satisfy our delivery commitments to our customers. In addition, we must manage our inventory to ensure we continue to meet our commitments as we introduce new products or make enhancements to our existing products.\nIf we overestimate market demand for our products and, as a result, increase our inventory in anticipation of customer orders that do not materialize, we will have excess inventory, which could result in increased risk of obsolescence and significant inventory write-downs. Furthermore, this will result in reduced production volumes and our fixed costs will be spread across fewer units, increasing our per unit costs. If we underestimate demand for our products, we will have inadequate inventory, which could slow down or interrupt the manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and our ability to recognize revenue. In addition, we may be unable to meet our supply commitments to customers, which could result in a loss of certain customer opportunities or a breach of our customer agreements resulting in payment of damages.\nProduct performance problems, including undetected errors in our hardware or software, or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation.\nThe development and production of products with high technology content is complicated and often involves problems with software, hardware, components and manufacturing methods. Complex hardware and software systems, such as our products, can often contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released. In addition, errors associated with components we purchase from third parties, including customized components, may be difficult to resolve. We have experienced issues in the past in connection with our products, including failures due to the receipt of faulty components from our suppliers and performance issues related to software updates. From time to time we have had to replace certain components, provide software remedies or other remediation in response to errors or bugs, and we may have to do so again in the future. In addition, performance issues can be heightened during periods where we are developing and introducing multiple new products to the market, as any performance issues we encounter in one technology or product could impact the performance or timing of delivery of other products. Our products may suffer degradation of performance and reliability over time. Also, as a result of the Acquisition, we will be adding, augmenting, and modifying significant parts of our combined portfolio with network management and network automation software and features. These efforts may introduce new software bugs or network level reliability issues that are not known at this time, which could cause us to lose customers and fail to add new customers.\nIf reliability, quality, security or network monitoring problems develop, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including:\n\u2022\nreduced orders from existing customers;\n\u2022\ndeclining interest from potential customers;\n\u2022\ndelays in our ability to recognize revenue or in collecting accounts receivables;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with fixing hardware or software defects or replacing products;\n\u2022\nhigh service and warranty expenses;\n\u2022\ndelays in shipments;\n\u2022\nhigh inventory excess and obsolescence expense;\n\u2022\nhigh levels of product returns;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts; and\n\u2022\npayment of liquidated damages, performance guarantees or similar penalties.\nBecause we outsource the manufacturing of certain components of our products, we may also be subject to product performance problems as a result of the acts or omissions of third parties.\nFrom time to time, we encounter interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer\u2019s site. These interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from issues with installation and activation, some of which are outside our control. If we experience significant interruptions or delays that we cannot promptly resolve, the associated revenue for these installations may be delayed or confidence in our products could be undermined, which could cause us to lose customers and fail to add new customers.\nIf our contract manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our business may be harmed.\nWe rely on third party contract manufacturers to perform a portion of the manufacturing of our products, and our future success will depend on our ability to have sufficient volumes of our products manufactured in a cost-effective and quality-controlled manner. We have engaged third parties to manufacture certain elements of our products at multiple contract manufacturing sites located around the world but do not have long-term agreements in place with some of our manufacturers and suppliers that will guarantee product availability, or the continuation of particular pricing or payment terms. There are a number of risks associated with our dependence on contract manufacturers, including:\n\u2022\nreduced control over delivery schedules, particularly for international contract manufacturing sites;\n\u2022\nreliance on the quality assurance procedures of third parties;\n\u2022\npotential uncertainty regarding manufacturing yields and costs;\n\u2022\npotential lack of adequate capacity during periods of high demand;\n\u2022\nlimited warranties on components;\n\u2022\npotential misappropriation of our intellectual property; and\n\u2022\npotential manufacturing disruptions (including disruptions caused by geopolitical events, military actions, work stoppages or natural disasters).\nAny of these risks could impair our ability to fulfill orders. Any delays by our contract manufacturers may cause us to be unable to meet the delivery requirements of our customers, which could decrease customer satisfaction and harm our product sales. In addition, if our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products or components of our products in required volumes or our relationship with any of our contract manufacturers is discontinued for any reason, we would be required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturers, which could cause us to be unable to meet our supply requirements to our customers and result in the breach of our customer agreements. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time-consuming and if we are required to change or qualify a new contract manufacturer, we could lose revenue and damage our customer relationships.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, which could result in an unexpected revenue shortfall in any given quarter.\nOur products can have a lengthy sales cycle, which can extend from six to twelve months and may take even longer for larger prospective customers. Our prospective customers conduct significant evaluation, testing, implementation and acceptance procedures before they purchase our products. We incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort during this time, regardless of whether we make a sale.\nBecause the purchase of our equipment involves substantial cost, most of our customers wait to purchase our equipment until they are ready to deploy it in their network. As a result, it is difficult for us to accurately predict the timing of future purchases by our customers. In addition, product purchases are often subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays. If sales expected from customers for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nIf we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur business requires significant capital. We have historically relied on outside debt or equity financing as well as cash flow from operations to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion. We may require additional capital from equity financing, debt financing or other financings in the future to fund our operations, respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities or to refinance our existing debt obligations. In the event that we require additional capital, we may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited and our business will be harmed.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, or we could incur significant expense to enforce our rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of methods to protect our intellectual property, including limiting access to certain information, and utilizing trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate to preclude misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation, unauthorized disclosure or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. This is likely to become an increasingly important issue if we expand our operations and product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and even if patents are issued, they may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with a competitive advantage, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our products, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult, time consuming and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could harm our business.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, many leading companies in the optical transport networking industry, including our competitors, have extensive patent portfolios with respect to optical transport networking technology. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur. From time to time, third parties may assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are important to our business or seek to invalidate the proprietary rights that we hold. Competitors or other third parties have, and may continue to assert claims or initiate litigation or other proceedings against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate our proprietary rights, with respect to our products and technology. In addition, we have had certain patent licenses with third parties that have not been renewed, and if we cannot successfully renew these licenses, we could face claims of infringement. In the event that we are unsuccessful in defending against any such claims, or any resulting lawsuit or proceedings, we could incur liability for damages and/or have valuable proprietary rights invalidated. For additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Item 1, \"Legal Proceedings,\" contained in Part II of this report.\nAny claim of infringement from a third party, even one without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, and could distract our management from running our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or could include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Competitors and other third parties have and may continue to assert infringement claims against our customers and sales partners. Any of these claims would require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, because we generally indemnify our customers and sales partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or sales partners, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may also be required to indemnify some customers under our contracts if a third party alleges, or a court finds, that our products have infringed upon the proprietary rights of other parties. From time to time, we have agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims made against our products, where such claims allege infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, patents, registered trademarks and/or copyrights. If we are required to make a significant payment under any of our indemnification obligations, our result of operations may be harmed.\nWe incorporate free and open source licensed software into our products. Although we monitor our use of such open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, non-compliance with open source software license terms and conditions could subject us to potential liability, including intellectual property infringement and/or contract claims. In such events, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished in a timely manner, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nThe trading prices of our common stock and the securities of other technology companies have been and may continue to be highly volatile. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of customers;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our future operating results or external guidance on those results or changes in recommendations or business expectations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nmergers and acquisitions by us (including the Acquisition), by our competitors or by our customers;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole; and\n\u2022\nadoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the broader stock market experience a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or operating results. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Each of these factors, among others, could harm the value of your investment in our common stock. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. If a suit were filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, it could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nUnfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and financial results.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for additional bandwidth capacity and on the economic health and willingness of our customers and potential customers to make capital commitments to purchase our products and services. As a result of macroeconomic or market uncertainty, we may face new risks that we have not yet identified. In addition, a number of the risks associated with our business, which are disclosed in these risk factors, may increase in likelihood, magnitude or duration.\nIn the past, unfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions have resulted in sustained periods of decreased demand for optical communications products. These conditions may also result in the tightening of credit markets, which may limit or delay our customers\u2019 ability to obtain necessary financing for their purchases of our products. A lack of liquidity in the capital markets or the continued uncertainty in the global economic environment may cause our customers to delay or cancel their purchases, increase the time they take to pay or default on their payment obligations, each of which would negatively affect our business and operating results. Weakness and uncertainty in the global economy could cause some of our customers to become illiquid, delay payments or adversely affect our collection of their accounts, which could result in a higher level of bad debt expense. In addition, currency fluctuations could negatively affect our international customers\u2019 ability or desire to purchase our products.\nChallenging economic conditions have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the telecommunications industry in which we operate. Such slowdowns may result in:\n\u2022\nreduced demand for our products as a result of constraints on capital spending by our customers;\n\u2022\nincreased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors, but also as a result of our customer\u2019s or potential customer\u2019s utilization of inventoried or underutilized products, which could put additional downward pressure on our near term gross profits;\n\u2022\nrisk of excess or obsolete inventories;\n\u2022\nexcess manufacturing capacity and higher associated overhead costs as a percentage of revenue; and\n\u2022\nmore limited ability to accurately forecast our business and future financial performance.\nA lack of liquidity and economic uncertainty may adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products from these suppliers. It may also cause some of our suppliers to become illiquid. Any of these impacts could limit our ability to obtain components for our products from these suppliers and could adversely impact our supply chain or the delivery schedule to our customers. This also could require us to purchase more expensive components, or re-design our products, which could cause increases in the cost of our products and delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products. Such events could harm our gross margin and harm our reputation and our customer relationships, either of which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may harm our operating results.\nSales of our products into international markets are an important part of our business and will be increasingly important given Coriant's international revenue mix. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 49%, 42% and 38%, respectively, of our revenue from customers outside of the United States. We expect that significant management attention and financial resources will be required for our international activities over the foreseeable future as we continue to operate in international markets. In some countries, our success in selling our products and growing revenue will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners. Our inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for international sales of our products could impact our ability to maintain or increase international market demand for our products. In addition, many of the companies we compete against internationally have greater name recognition and a more substantial sales and marketing presence.\nWe have sales and support personnel in numerous countries worldwide. In addition, we have established development centers in Canada, India and Sweden. There is no assurance that our reliance upon development resources in international locations will enable us to achieve meaningful cost reductions or greater resource efficiency. As a result of the Acquisition, we now have sales and support personnel in greater number of geographical locations throughout Asia (including China) and EMEA (with offices in the Middle East).\nOur international operations are subject to inherent risks, and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\ndifficulties of managing and staffing international offices, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022\ntariff and trade barriers and other regulatory requirements or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\nless effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the United States or other developed countries;\n\u2022\nlocal laws and practices that favor local companies, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\neffects of changes in currency exchange rates, particularly relative increases in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies that could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.\nInternational customers may also require that we comply with certain testing or customization of our products to conform to local standards. The product development costs to test or customize our products could be extensive and a material expense for us.\nOur international operations are subject to increasingly complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act and equivalent laws in other jurisdictions, antitrust or competition laws, and data privacy laws, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no complete assurance that any individual employee, contractor or agent will not violate our policies. Additionally, the costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of investigations, auditing and monitoring) could also adversely affect our current or future business.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to effectively anticipate and manage these and other risks and expenses associated with our international operations. For example, political instability and uncertainty in the European Union and, in particular, the United Kingdom's pending exit from the E.U. (Brexit) as well as other countries potentially choosing to exit the E.U., could slow economic growth in the region, affect foreign exchange rates, and could further discourage near-term economic activity, including our customers delaying purchases of our products. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, and business generally, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA portion of our sales and expenses stem from countries outside of the United States, and are in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuation. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency rates could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods. We may enter into other financial contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We currently enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on accounts receivable, and also to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses. These forward contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain transactions, but do not cover all foreign-denominated transactions and therefore do not entirely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\nOur effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\nchanges in the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022\nchanging tax laws, regulations, rates and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting and tax treatment of equity-based compensation;\n\u2022\nchanges to the financial accounting rules for income taxes; and\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits.\nThe international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) and perceived international tax avoidance techniques. The recommendations of the BEPS Project led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are involved in much of the coordinated activity, although the timing and methods of implementation vary. In addition, U.S. tax reform continues to be a priority for the current administration, and changes to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The provisions of the act require, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes, many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review. These processes include, but are not limited to, calculating revenue, deferred revenue and inventory costs. While we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review and put in place controls to reduce the likelihood for errors, we expect that for the foreseeable future, many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error. In addition, if we are unable to implement key operation controls around pricing, spending and other financial processes, we may not be able to improve our financial performance.\nAny acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operations.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions of businesses, technologies and other assets in the past, including most recently the acquisition of Coriant. In order to make acquisitions, we may use cash, issue equity that could dilute our current stockholders, or incur debt or assume indebtedness. If we are unable to achieve the anticipated strategic benefits of such acquisitions, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected if the integration or the anticipated financial and strategic benefits of such acquisitions are not realized as rapidly as, or to the extent anticipated by investors and securities analysts.\nAcquisitions can also result in adverse tax consequences, warranty or product liability exposure related to acquired assets, additional stock-based compensation expense, and write-up of acquired inventory to fair value. In addition, we may record goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with an acquisition and incur impairment charges in the future. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are less favorable than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges.\nAcquisitions also involve numerous risks that could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management team, including:\n\u2022\nproblems integrating the acquired operations, technologies or products with our own;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering new markets; and\n\u2022\nloss of key employees.\nOur failure to adequately manage the risks associated with an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nUnforeseen health, safety and environmental costs could harm our business.\nOur manufacturing operations use substances that are regulated by various federal, state and international laws governing health, safety and the environment, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals regulations\nadopted by the European Union. If we experience a problem with complying with these regulations, it could cause an interruption or delay in our manufacturing operations or it could cause us to incur liabilities for any costs related to health, safety or environmental remediation. We could also be subject to liability if we do not handle these substances in compliance with safety standards for storage and transportation and applicable laws. If we experience a problem or fail to comply with such safety standards, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign trade control laws that may limit where and to whom we sell our products. These trade control laws also limit our ability to conduct product development activities in certain countries and restrict the handling of our U.S. export controlled technology. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products and certain product features or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in U.S. and foreign import and export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the import and export of our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in import and export regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies impacted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis, or at all, or any limitation on our ability to develop, export or sell our products would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur product or manufacturing standards could also be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives. For instance, the SEC has adopted disclosure requirements relating to the use of conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and certain other adjoining countries. Those rules, which require us to report on our processes and supply chain around sourcing these minerals, could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) has jurisdiction over the entire U.S. communications industry and, as a result, our products and our U.S. customers are subject to FCC rules and regulations. In December 2017, the FCC voted to roll back its 2015 order regulating broadband Internet service providers as telecommunications service carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. This decision repeals net neutrality regulations that prohibit blocking, degrading or prioritizing certain types of Internet traffic and restores the light touch regulatory treatment of broadband service in place prior to 2015. Changes in regulatory requirements or uncertainty associated with the regulatory environment could delay or impede investment in network infrastructures by our customers, which could adversely affect the sale of our products and services. Similarly, changes in regulatory tariff requirements or other regulations relating to pricing or terms of carriage on communications networks could slow the development or expansion of network infrastructures and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition, international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop products for international customers in the future. Moreover, many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, which can affect the market and requirements for networking and communications equipment. For example, in April 2016, the European Parliament approved the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect in May 2018 and supersedes current EU data protection regulations. The GDPR will impose stringent data handling requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the EU, and non-compliance with the GDPR could result in significant penalties, including data protection audits and heavy fines. Any failure to obtain the required approvals or comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations.\nOur headquarters and the majority of our infrastructure, including our PIC fabrication manufacturing facility, are located in Northern California, an area that is susceptible to earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters. Further, a terrorist attack aimed at Northern California or at the United States energy or telecommunications infrastructure could hinder or delay the development and sale of our products. In the event that an earthquake, terrorist attack or other man-made or natural catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities, or certain of our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, our business, financial condition and operating results would be harmed.\nSecurity incidents, such as data breaches and cyber-attacks, could compromise our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including data related to our intellectual property and data related to our business, customers and business partners, which is considered proprietary or confidential information. We believe that companies in the technology industry have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. While the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation, our network and storage applications, and those systems and other business applications maintained by our third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such security incidents or data breaches and the damage caused as a result. Accordingly, a data breach, cyber-attack, or unauthorized access or disclosure of our information, could compromise our intellectual property and reveal proprietary or confidential business information. While we continually work to safeguard our internal network systems and validate the security of our third party providers to mitigate these potential risks, including through information security policies and employee awareness and training, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches. We have been subjected in the past to a range of incidents including phishing, emails purporting to come from an executive or vendor seeking payment requests, and communications from look-alike corporate domains. While these have not had a material effect on our business or our network security to date, security incidents involving access or improper use of our systems, networks or products could compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. These security incidents could cause us to incur significant remediation costs and expenses, subject us to regulatory action, disrupt key business operations, open us up to liability, and divert attention of management and key information technology resources, any of which could cause significant harm to our business and reputation.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which apply to us, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d convertible preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office rather than by stockholders;\n\u2022\nprevent stockholders from calling special meetings; and\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders.\nRisks Related to our 2024 Notes\nOur debt obligations may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and will be a burden on our future cash resources, particularly if we elect to settle these obligations in cash upon conversion or upon maturity or required repurchase.\nIn September 2018, we issued the 2024 Notes, which will mature on September 1, 2024, unless earlier repurchased by us or converted. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, litigation, general corporate or other purposes may be limited; and\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our future cash balance may be dedicated to the payment of the principal of our indebtedness as we have stated the intention to pay the principal amount of the 2024 Notes in cash upon conversion or when otherwise due, such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments, including the 2024 Notes, depends on our future cash flow performance. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate positive cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. For example, in the first quarter after the Acquisition, the combined company had a significant net loss and negative cash flows. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations. As a result, we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with conversions of the 2024 Notes, and thereby dilute our existing stockholders and potentially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the event that some or all of the 2024 Notes are converted and we elect to deliver shares of common stock, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the 2024 Notes could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe fundamental change provisions of the 2024 Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nIf a fundamental change, such as an acquisition of our company, occurs prior to the maturity of the 2024 Notes, holders of the 2024 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes. In addition, if such fundamental change also constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, the conversion rate for the 2024 Notes may be increased upon conversion of the 2024 Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Any increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the make-whole fundamental change occurs or becomes effective and the price paid (or deemed paid) per share of our common stock in such transaction. Any such increase will be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Our obligation to repurchase 2024 Notes or increase the conversion rate upon the occurrence of a make-whole\nfundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the 2024 Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with the \u201coption counterparties.\u201d The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2024 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nFrom time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2024 Notes. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe option counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.", "PERMNO": 92095, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "INFN"}
