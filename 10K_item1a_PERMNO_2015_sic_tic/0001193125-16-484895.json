{"cik": "917491", "company": "FARO TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe statements under this heading describe the most significant risks to our business identified by management and should be considered carefully in conjunction with the discussion in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in, or retain, shares of our common stock.\nAny of the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. These are not the only risks we face. Our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known by us or by factors that we currently do not consider material to our business.\nCompetitors may develop products that make our products obsolete or less competitive.\nThe CAM2 market is characterized by rapid technological change. Competitors may develop new or improved products, processes or technologies that may make our products obsolete or less competitive.\nAs a result, our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our technological advantage by developing new products and applications and enhancing our existing products, which can be complex and time-consuming and require substantial investment. Significant delays in new product releases or difficulties in developing new products could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or maintain our technological advantage.\nOur financial performance is dependent on the conditions of various industries, including the automotive, aerospace, and heavy equipment industries, which have from time to time experienced, and may again experience, significant disruptions in the economic environment.\nA significant portion of our sales are to manufacturers in the automotive, aerospace, and heavy equipment industries. We are dependent upon the continued viability and financial stability of our customers in these industries, which are highly cyclical and dependent upon the general health of the economy and consumer spending.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, we face significant exposure to foreign exchange rate risk.\nOur results of operations are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, which has caused, and may continue to cause, significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in potentially significant foreign exchange gains and losses. To the extent that the percentage of our non-U.S. dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future, our exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase.\nWe may be unable to recognize the anticipated benefits of our reorganization initiatives.\nOn February 24, 2016, we announced our intention to pursue various reorganization initiatives targeting certain vertical markets, modernizing our sales process, harmonizing our global functions and accelerating our product development efforts. Management expects to derive certain benefits from these reorganization initiatives, including accelerating sales growth, improving the leverage of our sales organization and optimizing management and operations. A variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results and experience to differ materially from those anticipated, resulting in an inability to realize the expected benefits of the reorganization initiatives and our ability to execute our plans and strategies.\nThe buying process for most of our customers for our measurement products is highly decentralized and typically requires significant time and expense for us to further penetrate the potential market of a specific customer, which may delay our ability to generate additional revenue.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to further penetrate our customer base. During 2015, approximately 73% of our revenue was attributable to sales to our existing customers. If we are not able to continue to further penetrate our existing customer base, our sales growth may further decline. However, most of our customers have a decentralized\nbuying process for measurement devices, and we must spend significant time and resources to increase revenues from a specific customer. For example, we may provide products to only one of our customer\u2019s manufacturing facilities or for a specific product line within a manufacturing facility. We cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase the amount of sales to our existing customers, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur ability to protect our patents and proprietary rights in the United States and foreign countries could adversely affect our revenues.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary right protection for our processes and products in the United States and other countries. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing inventions to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our technology and trade secrets, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and contractors. However, our employees may breach these agreements; or, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by inventors. If we are unable to obtain or maintain protection of our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur patent protection involves complex legal and technical questions. Our patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Further, we may be able to protect our proprietary rights from infringement by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary processes and products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies. Litigation or other proceedings to defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant time and money, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nClaims from others that we infringed on their intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from others claiming that we infringed on their intellectual property rights. Resolving these claims may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products, or require us to pay damages. In addition, from time to time, we are involved in intellectual property lawsuits. We could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any litigation or interference proceedings, regardless of their outcome, may be costly and may require significant time and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nProduct failures or product availability and performance issues could result in increased warranty costs, delays in new product introductions and enhancements, and could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe regularly introduce new products and enhance existing products. Failures in our new or existing products could result in increased warranty costs, delays in new product introductions, and a loss of sales and customers, and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to achieve financial results within our target goals, and our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to achieve financial results that are within our goals is subject to a number of factors beyond our control. Moreover, our annual and quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and likely will vary significantly in the future. Factors that cause our financial results to fluctuate include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the manufacturing industry and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales promotions;\n\u2022\ngeographic expansion in our regions;\n\u2022\ntraining and ramp-up time for new sales people;\n\u2022\ninvestments in strategic sales, product or other initiatives;\n\u2022\ninvestments in technologies and new products and product enhancements, including costs associated with new development and product introductions, and the timing and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nexcess or obsolete inventory, shrinkage or other inventory losses due to product obsolescence, change in demand for our products, scrap or material price changes;\n\u2022\nexpansion of our manufacturing capability;\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of customer orders, many of which are received towards the end of the quarter;\n\u2022\nthe amount of time that it takes to fulfill orders and ship our products;\n\u2022\nthe length of our sales cycle to new customers;\n\u2022\ncustomer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nstart-up costs and ramp-up time associated with opening new sales offices outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nvariations in the effective income tax rate and difficulty in predicting the tax rate on a quarterly and annual basis; and\n\u2022\nlitigation and regulatory action brought against us.\nAny one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly operating results in the future and could cause us to fail to achieve our target financial results.\nOur growth depends on the ability of our products to attain broad market acceptance.\nThe market for traditional fixed-base CMMs, check fixtures, handheld measurement tools, and surveying equipment is mature. Part of our strategy is to continue to displace these traditional measurement devices. Displacing traditional measurement devices and achieving broad market acceptance for our products requires significant effort to convince customers to reevaluate their historical measurement procedures and methodologies.\nThe potential size and growth rate of the CAM2 market is uncertain and difficult to quantify. If the CAM2 market does not continue to expand or does not expand as quickly we anticipate, we may not be able to grow our sales, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe market seven closely interdependent products (FaroArm, FARO Laser ScanArm, FARO Gage, FARO Laser Tracker, FARO Cobalt Array 3D Imager, FARO Focus3D and FARO Freestyle3D) and related software for use in measurement, inspection, and high density surveying applications. Substantially all of our revenues are currently derived from sales of these products and software, and we plan to continue our business strategy of focusing on the software-driven, 3D measurement and inspection market. Consequently, our financial performance will depend, in large part, on computer-based measurement, inspection and high density surveying products achieving broad market acceptance. If our products cannot attain broad market acceptance, we will not grow as anticipated and may be required to make increased expenditures on research and development for new applications or new products.\nWe compete with manufacturers of measurement systems and traditional measurement devices, many of which have more resources than us and may develop new products and technologies.\nThe broad market for measurement devices is highly competitive. In the FARO Gage product line, we compete with manufacturers of handheld measurement tools and fixed-base CMMs, including some large, well-established companies. In the FaroArm, FARO Laser ScanArm, FARO Laser Tracker, FARO Focus3D and FARO Cobalt Array 3D Imager product lines, we compete primarily with Hexagon Metrology, a division of Hexagon AB, and with Steinbichler Optotechnik GmbH and GOM GmbH in the FARO Cobalt Array 3D Imager product line. We also compete in these product lines with a number of other smaller companies. We compete on the basis of technical innovation, product performance, quality, and price with respect to all of our products.\nWe will be required to make continued investments in technology and product development to maintain the technological advantage that we believe we currently have over our competition. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we possess. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our technology or our product development efforts will allow us to successfully compete as the industry evolves. As the market for our measurement systems expands, additional competition may emerge and our existing and future competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which we participate. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by pricing strategies pursued by competitors or technological or product developments by competitors.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the review of certain deferred income tax accounts. If we do not remediate this material weakness and fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our financial statements could contain a material misstatement, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. As part of this process, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting; management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.\nIn connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we recently identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the review of certain deferred income tax accounts. Specifically, inaccurate unearned service revenue balances were used to calculate the deferred tax amounts in China and our internal controls over the review of the related deferred income tax accounts in foreign jurisdictions were not sufficiently designed to identify reasonably possible errors, including the lack of certain specific, documented instructions to the reviewers of the foreign income tax provisions. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2015. Notwithstanding the existence of this material weakness, our management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods and dates presented. Our management team has reviewed and discussed the identified material weakness with the Audit Committee and is in the process of developing and implementing an action plan to remediate it. A more complete description of this material weakness is included in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe cannot be certain that our remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts. If the remedial measures are insufficient to address the identified material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. This could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and adversely affect our business, our financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe derive a substantial part of our revenues from our international operations, which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations.\nWe derive more than half of our revenues from international operations. Our international operations are subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022\nlonger customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ncompliance with export and import regulations and trade restrictions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the United States; and\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices.\nSeveral of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies, which may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks. These factors may harm our results of operations and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective.\nReductions in defense spending could adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our customers operate in the defense sector and depend significantly on U.S. government spending. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011, which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending through 2021. Automatic spending reductions, referred to as sequestration, were implemented in March 2013. Ongoing budgetary discussions in the federal government may result in other cuts to defense spending. Reductions in defense spending that impact the aerospace and defense industries could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certification processes and regulations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those governing antitrust and competition, the environment, import and export of products, currency conversions and repatriation, taxation of foreign earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel, and use of local employees and suppliers. An inability to comply with these regulations or obtain any necessary certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, as a manufacturer of electrical goods, we are subject to the European Union\u2019s RoHS2 and WEEE directives, which took effect during 2006. RoHS2 prohibits the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products, and WEEE makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of covered electronic products and components. Parallel initiatives are being proposed in other jurisdictions, including several states in the United States and China.\nWe currently hold WEEE registration and are in compliance with the directives of the European Union. Under the classification of \u201cIndustrial Monitoring and Control Instruments,\u201d our products have until July 22, 2017 to become compliant with the RoHS2 directive. Currently, only the FARO Laser Tracker ION does not meet the RoHS2 directive. However, if we are unable to bring the FARO Laser Tracker ION into compliance with the RoHS2 directive by July 22, 2017, we would be unable to sell the FARO Laser Tracker ION in European Union countries and China, and potentially in several states in the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-corruption laws could subject us to fines and penalties.\nIn 2012, our monitorship expired pursuant to our settlement with the SEC and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, concerning certain payments made by our subsidiary in China that may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other applicable laws. We are, of course, still subject to such laws and have adopted and maintain a compliance\nprogram designed to ensure compliance with these laws; however, in light of our prior conduct, any future failure to comply with any such continuing obligations could result in the SEC and the DOJ aggressively seeking to impose penalties against us. In addition, many countries in which we operate have increased regulation regarding anti-corruption practices generally. Compliance with such regulations could be costly and could adversely impact our results of operations or delay entry into new markets.\nWe may not be able to identify or consummate acquisitions or achieve expected benefits from or effectively integrate acquisitions, which could harm our growth.\nOur growth strategy partly depends on our ability to obtain additional technologies, complementary product lines and sales channels through selective acquisitions and strategic investments. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions, if necessary, on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. In the past, we have used our stock as consideration for acquisitions. Our common stock may not remain at a price at which it can be used as consideration for acquisitions without diluting our existing shareholders, and potential acquisition candidates may not view our stock attractively.\nIn addition, realization of the benefits of acquisitions often requires integration of some or all of the sales and marketing, distribution, manufacturing, engineering, software development, customer service, finance and administrative organizations of the acquired companies. The integration of acquisitions demands substantial attention from senior management and the management of the acquired companies. Any acquisition may be subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to assimilate effectively the operations, products, technologies and personnel of the acquired companies (some of which may be located in diverse geographic regions);\n\u2022\nthe inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe need or obligation to divest portions of the acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of relationships with customers.\nWe cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate any suitable acquisitions, that any acquired companies will operate profitably, or that we will realize the expected synergies and other benefits from any acquisition.\nWe may face difficulties managing the effects of our growth.\nIf our business grows rapidly in the future, we expect it to result in:\n\u2022\nincreased complexity;\n\u2022\nincreased responsibility for existing and new management personnel; and\n\u2022\nincremental strain on our operations and financial and management systems.\nIf we are not able to manage the effects of our future growth, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nOur dependence on suppliers for materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products.\nOutside vendors provide key components used in the manufacture of our products. Any supply interruption in a limited source component would hinder our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier\u2019s variation in a component, either known or unknown, or incompatibility with our manufacturing processes could hinder our ability to manufacture our products. We may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable period of time, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the manufacture of components of our potential products, we may experience delays or interruptions in our operations, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe disclosure requirements under the \u201cconflict minerals\u201d provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could increase our costs and limit the supply of certain metals used in our products and affect our reputation with customers and shareholders.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted disclosure requirements, which became effective in 2014, for public companies using certain minerals and metals in their products. These minerals and metals are generally referred to as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d regardless of their country of origin. Under these rules, we are required to perform due diligence and disclose our efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. Conflict minerals are commonly used in the manufacture of electronics and may be incorporated in our products. As a result of these regulations, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the conflict minerals used in our products. These requirements could also adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals, and the pool of suppliers who provide \u201cconflict free\u201d metals may be limited. As a result, we or our suppliers may not be able to obtain materials necessary for production of our products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. In addition, since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of all metals used in our products and confirm that they are \u201cconflict free,\u201d which may adversely affect our reputation. Implementation of certain provisions of the rule has been delayed as a result of pending litigation challenging certain aspects of the rule. We continue to monitor these developments and their implications on us.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of sales or decreased profitability.\nOn March 20, 2015, we announced the departure of our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Abram, and on December 7, 2015, we announced the resignation of our Chief Executive Officer, Jay Freeland. While we have subsequently hired a new Chief Financial Officer, Laura Murphy-Wolf, and have appointed our Chairman, Dr. Simon Raab, as interim President and Chief Executive Officer, these senior leadership changes could impact our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to support our growth and could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations.\nIn addition, the loss of any of our current executive officers, or other key personnel, could adversely affect our sales, profitability or growth. Moreover, we continue to rely, in part, on equity awards to attract and retain qualified personnel, which may result in an increase in compensation expense.\nRisks generally associated with our information systems could adversely affect our business reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on our information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to, among other things:\n\u2022\nfacilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items;\n\u2022\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022\naccurately bill and collect from customers;\n\u2022\nprocess payments to suppliers and employees; and\n\u2022\nsummarize results and manage our business.\nOur primary and back-up computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees. Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business computer systems or failure of our back-up systems could lead to a loss of sales or decreased profitability.\nA cyberattack or security breach of our systems may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our internal data and the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers or their data. Computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists may attempt to penetrate our network security and our website. Unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through break-ins, sabotage, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers, suppliers or other vendors. Any security breach, cyberattack or cyber security breach, and any incident involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, sensitive or confidential customer information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage, could interrupt our operations and damage our reputation, and could also result in regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks of natural disasters.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in each of our regions. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather where we have a manufacturing facility could result in physical damage to, and complete or partial closure of, our manufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance. Interruptions in our manufacturing operations or damage to our manufacturing facilities could reduce our revenues and increase our costs, and the extent of losses from natural disasters and severe weather will be a function of both the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposure. Although we maintain insurance coverage, we can offer no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any losses or that we will be able to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost in the future. If losses from business interruption or property damage exceed the amounts for which we are insured, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience volatility in our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for, and sales of, our products or prolonged downturns in the industries that we serve;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic uncertainties;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community; and\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors.\nThe market price of our common stock may also be affected by our inability to meet analyst and investor expectations and failure to achieve projected financial results. Any failure to meet such expectations or projected financial results, even if minor, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Volatility in our stock price may result in the inability of our shareholders to sell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased them.\nOur relatively small public float and daily trading volume have in the past caused, and may in the future result in, significant volatility in our stock price. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 16.3 million shares outstanding held by non-affiliates. Our daily trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2015 averaged approximately 186,005 shares.\nIn addition, stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market prices of equity securities of many companies have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, securities class action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against such companies following periods of volatility in the market price of such companies\u2019 securities. If any such litigation is instigated against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and provisions of Florida law could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor.\nOur articles of incorporation, bylaws and provisions of Florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Although we believe such provisions are appropriate to protect long-term value for our shareholders, these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our shares. Because of these provisions, you might not be able to receive a premium on your investment. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na limitation on shareholders\u2019 ability to call a special meeting of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements to nominate directors for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nour classified board of directors, which means that approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.\nThe provisions described above could delay or make more difficult transactions involving a change in control of the Company or our management.", "PERMNO": 85372, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "FARO"}
