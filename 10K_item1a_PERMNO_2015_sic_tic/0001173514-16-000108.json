Any downturn in the general economy could result in significant decreases in the Company's revenue and profitability and an inability to sustain or grow the business.\nThe Company's lift truck business historically has been cyclical. Fluctuations in the rate of orders for lift trucks and fuel-cell technology reflect the capital investment decisions of the Company's customers, which depend to a certain extent on the general level of economic activity in the various industries the lift truck customers serve. During economic downturns, customers tend to delay new lift truck and parts purchases. Consequently, the Company has experienced, and in the future may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in revenues and net income. If there is a downturn in the general economy, or in the industries served by lift truck customers, the Company's revenue and profitability could decrease significantly, and the Company may not be able to sustain or grow the business.\nThe pricing and costs of the Company's products have been and may continue to be impacted by non-U.S. currency fluctuations, which could materially increase costs, and result in material exchange losses and reduce operating margins.\nBecause the Company conducts transactions in various non-U.S. currencies, including the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi and Swedish kroner, lift truck pricing is subject to the effects of fluctuations in the value of these non-U.S. currencies and fluctuations in the related currency exchange rates. As a result, the Company's sales have historically been affected by, and may continue to be affected by, these fluctuations. In addition, exchange rate movements between currencies in which the Company purchases materials and components and manufactures certain products and the currencies in which the Company sells those products have been affected by and may continue to result in exchange losses that could materially reduce operating margins. Furthermore, the Company's hedging contracts may not fully offset risks from changes in currency exchange rates.\nThe cost of raw materials used by the Company's products has and may continue to fluctuate, which could materially reduce the Company's profitability.\nAt times, the Company has experienced significant increases in materials costs, primarily as a result of global increases in industrial metals including steel, lead and copper and other commodity prices, such as rubber, as a result of increased demand and limited supply. The Company manufactures products that include raw materials that consist of steel, rubber, copper, lead, castings and counterweights. The Company also purchases parts provided by suppliers that are manufactured from castings and steel or contain lead. The cost of these parts is affected by the same economic conditions that impact the cost of the parts the Company manufactures. The cost to manufacture lift trucks and related service parts has been and will continue to be affected by fluctuations in prices for these raw materials. If costs of these raw materials increase, the Company's profitability could be reduced.\nThe Company is subject to risks relating to its non-U.S. operations.\nNon-U.S. operations represent a significant portion of the Company's business. The Company expects revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenue. The Company owns or leases manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and Northern Ireland, and owns interests in joint ventures with facilities in China, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam. The Company also sells U.S. produced products to non-U.S. customers and sells non-U.S. produced products to U.S. customers. The Company's non-U.S. operations are subject to additional risks, which include:\n\u2022\npotential political, economic and social instability in the non-U.S. countries in which the Company operates;\n\u2022\ncurrency risks, including those risks set forth under, \u201cThe pricing and costs of the Company's products have been and may continue to be impacted by non-U.S. currency fluctuations, which could materially increase costs and result in material exchange losses and reduce operating margins\u201d;\n\u2022\nimposition of or increases in currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\npotential inflation in the applicable non-U.S. economies;\n\u2022\nimposition of or increases in import duties and other tariffs on products;\n\u2022\nimposition of or increases in non-U.S. taxation of earnings and withholding on payments received;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes affecting non-U.S. operations; and\n\u2022\nstringent labor regulations.\nPart of the strategy to expand worldwide market share is strengthening the Company's non-U.S. distribution network. A part of this strategy also includes decreasing costs by sourcing basic components in lower-cost countries. Implementation of this part of the strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above and there can be no assurance that such risks will not have an adverse effect on the Company's revenues, profitability or market share.\nThe Company operates in various taxing jurisdictions around the world in which the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices are often subject to interpretation as well as to change. Although the Company has sought to reduce this uncertainty by obtaining rulings from the tax authorities in certain cases, the Company's positions may still be subject to challenge. If the Company were to become subject to a challenge, the outcome could have a significant negative effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition. Additionally, any challenge may unfavorably impact the Company's ability to obtain future rulings.\nThe Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for specific critical components.\nThe Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for some of its critical components, including diesel, gasoline and alternative fuel engines and cast-iron counterweights used to counterbalance some lift trucks. Some of these critical components are imported and subject to regulation, primarily with respect to customary inspection of such products by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The results of operations could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to obtain these critical components, or if the costs of these critical\ncomponents were to increase significantly, due to regulatory compliance or otherwise, and the Company was unable to pass the cost increases on to its customers.\nIf the Company's strategic initiatives, including the introduction of new products, do not prove effective, revenues, profitability and market share could be significantly reduced.\nChanges in the timing of implementation of the Company's current strategic initiatives may result in a delay in the expected recognition of future costs and realization of future benefits. In addition, if future industry demand levels are lower than expected, the actual annual cost savings could be lower than expected. If the Company is unable to successfully implement these strategic initiatives, revenues, profitability and market share could be significantly reduced.\nFailure to compete effectively within the Company's industry could result in a significant decrease in revenues and profitability.\nThe Company experiences intense competition in the sale of lift trucks and aftermarket parts. Competition in the lift truck industry is based primarily on strength and quality of dealers, brand loyalty, customer service, new lift truck sales prices, availability of products and aftermarket parts, comprehensive product line offerings, product performance, product quality and features and the cost of ownership over the life of the lift truck. The Company competes with several global manufacturers that operate in all major markets. These manufacturers may have lower manufacturing costs and greater financial resources than the Company, which may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions. If the Company fails to compete effectively, revenues and profitability could be significantly reduced.\nThe Company relies primarily on its network of independent dealers to sell lift trucks and aftermarket parts and the Company has no direct control over sales by those dealers to customers. Ineffective or poor performance by these independent dealers could result in a significant decrease in revenues and profitability and the inability to sustain or grow the business.\nThe Company relies primarily on independent dealers for sales of lift trucks and aftermarket parts. Sales of the Company's products are therefore subject to the quality and effectiveness of the dealers, who are not subject to the Company's direct control. As a result, ineffective or poorly performing dealers could result in a significant decrease in revenues and profitability and we may not be able to sustain or grow the Company's business.\nIf the global capital goods market declines, the cost saving efforts the Company has implemented may not be sufficient to achieve the benefits expected.\nIf the global economy or the capital goods market declines, revenues could decline. If revenues are lower than expected, the programs the Company has implemented may not achieve the benefits expected. Furthermore, the Company may be forced to take additional cost saving steps that could result in additional charges that materially adversely affect the ability to compete or implement the Company's current business strategies.\nActual liabilities relating to pending lawsuits may exceed the Company's expectations.\nThe Company is a defendant in pending lawsuits involving, among other things, product liability claims. The Company cannot be sure that it will succeed in defending these claims, that judgments will not be rendered against the Company with respect to any or all of these proceedings or that reserves set aside or insurance policies will be adequate to cover any such judgments. The Company could incur a charge to earnings if reserves prove to be inadequate or the average cost per claim or the number of claims exceed estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and liquidity for the period in which the charge is taken and any judgment or settlement amount is paid.\nThe Company is subject to recourse or repurchase obligations with respect to the financing arrangements of some of its customers.\nThrough arrangements with GECC and others, dealers and other customers are provided financing for new lift trucks in the United States and in major countries of the world outside of the United States. Through these arrangements, the Company's dealers and certain customers are extended credit for the purchase of lift trucks to be placed in the dealer\u2019s floor plan inventory or the financing of lift trucks that are sold or leased to customers. For some of these arrangements, the Company provides recourse or repurchase obligations such that it would become obligated in the event of default by the dealer or customer. Total amounts subject to these types of obligations at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $168.6 million and $176.1 million, respectively. Generally, the Company maintains a perfected security interest in the assets financed such that, in the event that the Company becomes obligated under the terms of the recourse or repurchase obligations, it may take title to the assets financed. The Company cannot be certain, however, that the security interest will equal or exceed the amount of the recourse or repurchase obligations. In addition, the Company cannot be certain that losses under the terms of the recourse or repurchase obligations will not exceed the reserves that have been set aside in the consolidated financial statements. The Company could\nincur a charge to earnings if reserves prove to be inadequate, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and liquidity for the period in which the charge is taken.\nGECC may sell its interest in NFS or General Electric Company (\"GEC\"), the parent of GECC, may sell GECC. Such a sale could negatively impact the operation of NFS and remove an option that the Company\u2019s U.S. dealers\u2019 and customers\u2019 have to finance the purchase of lift trucks.\nOn April 10, 2015, GECC\u2019s parent company, GEC, announced a plan to reduce the size of its financial services businesses through the sale of most of the assets of GECC over the 24 months following the announcement. Further, on October 13, 2015, GEC announced it had reached an agreement to sell GE Capital's global Commercial Distribution Finance, North American Vendor Finance and Corporate Finance platforms to Wells Fargo & Co (\"Wells Fargo\"). If GECC\u2019s interest in NFS is sold to Wells Fargo or another third-party, there is no guarantee that the acquirer will continue to cause NFS to be operated in a manner consistent with past practice pursuant to the terms of the Company\u2019s agreements with GECC. Furthermore, the joint venture agreement governing NFS expires in December 2018, after which it automatically renews for additional one-year terms unless written notice is given by either party at least 180 days prior to termination. Also, either party to the joint venture agreement governing NFS may terminate such agreement upon 180 days' notice. Any acquirer may seek to terminate the NFS joint venture agreement in December 2018, or seek to terminate it earlier. The Company may also seek to terminate the NFS joint venture agreement based on its experience with or other information related to any acquirer. In the event of any such termination, a substitute joint venture partner or alternative financing arrangements may not be available on comparable terms, or at all.\nIn the event that Wells Fargo or another third-party acquiring GECC interests in NFS does not cause NFS to continue to operate in a manner consistent with past practice or the joint venture agreement is terminated and the Company's dealers and customers cannot arrange for alternative financing arrangements in the U.S. on comparable terms, or at all, the Company\u2019s sales of lift trucks could be negatively impacted and its revenues, profitability and market share could be reduced.\nActual liabilities relating to environmental matters may exceed the Company's expectations.\nThe Company's manufacturing operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances. If the Company fails to comply with these laws or the Company's environmental permits, then the Company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, future changes to environmental laws could require the Company to incur significant additional expenses or restrict operations.\nThe Company's products may also be subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing vehicle exhausts. Regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe have issued or proposed various regulations and directives designed to reduce emissions from spark-ignited engines and diesel engines used in off-road vehicles, such as industrial lift trucks. These regulations require the Company and other lift truck manufacturers to incur costs to modify designs and manufacturing processes and to perform additional testing and reporting.\nThe Company is investigating or remediating historical contamination at some current and former sites caused by its operations or those of businesses it acquired. While the Company is not currently aware that any material outstanding claims or obligations exist with regard to these sites, the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant cleanup costs that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with any acquisition the Company has made, it could, under some circumstances, be held financially liable for or suffer other adverse effects due to environmental violations or contamination caused by prior owners of businesses acquired. In addition, under some of the agreements through which the Company has sold businesses or assets, it has retained responsibility for certain contingent environmental liabilities arising from pre-closing operations. These liabilities may not arise, if at all, until years later and could require the Company to incur significant additional expenses, which could materially adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may become subject to claims under non-U.S. laws and regulations, which may require expensive, time consuming and distracting litigation.\nBecause the Company has employees, property and business operations outside of the United States, it is subject to the laws and the court systems of many jurisdictions. The Company may become subject to claims outside the United States based in non-U.S. jurisdictions for violations of their laws with respect to the Company's non-U.S. operations. In addition, these laws may be changed or new laws may be enacted in the future. Non-U.S. litigation is often expensive, time consuming and distracting. As a result, any of these risks could significantly reduce profitability and the Company's ability to operate its businesses effectively.\nThe Company may be subject to risk relating to increasing cash requirements of certain employee benefits plans which may affect its financial position.\nThe expenses recorded for, and cash contributions required to be made to, the Company's defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual investment returns. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the value of plan assets or investment losses on plan assets may require the Company to increase the cash contributed to defined benefit plans which may affect its financial position.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel, and the loss of these key personnel could significantly reduce profitability.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the skills, experience and services of key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. Employment and retention of qualified personnel is important to the successful conduct of the Company's business. Therefore, the Company's success also depends upon its ability to recruit, hire, train and retain additional skilled and experienced management personnel. The Company's inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills could impair its ability to manage and operate its business effectively and could significantly reduce profitability.\nOther products may be introduced to the market by competitors, making the Nuvera technology less marketable.\nThe use of fuel-cell technology in industrial and commercial applications is a relatively new development. Companies implementing such technology face competition from competitors that integrate more traditional energy technologies into their product lines, as well as competitors that have implemented or are implementing alternatives to traditional energy technologies, such as lithium batteries, fuel additives and other high efficiency or \u201crenewable\u201d technologies. Any of these technologies may have more established or otherwise more attractive manufacturing, distribution and operating cost features, which could negatively impact customers\u2019 preferences for product lines that incorporate fuel-cell technology and, as a result, diminish the marketability of products incorporating Nuvera technology.\nThe Company may encounter unexpected difficulties integrating Nuvera into its businesses.\nThe acquisition of Nuvera was intended to provide direct access to fuel-cell technology suitable for lift truck applications. This strategy's success will depend on the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize Nuvera\u2019s technology, to integrate Nuvera\u2019s business with its own and to develop satisfactory working arrangements with Nuvera\u2019s existing employees. Unexpected difficulties in integrating Nuvera with the Company\u2019s operations could occur and the Company may not realize the magnitude, or timing, of benefits initially anticipated in connection with the Nuvera acquisition.\nThe Company may not be successful in commercializing Nuvera\u2019s technology, which success would depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to protect Nuvera\u2019s intellectual property.\nThe success of the acquisition of Nuvera will depend largely on the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize Nuvera\u2019s fuel-cell technologies, such that the Company may incorporate these technologies in its product lines on economically efficient terms. However, unforeseen difficulties, such as delays in development due to design defects or changes in specifications and insufficient research and development resources or cost overruns, may hinder the Company\u2019s ability to incorporate Nuvera\u2019s technologies into its product lines on an economically favorable basis or at all.\nFurthermore, Nuvera\u2019s commercial success will depend largely on the Company\u2019s ability to maintain patent and other intellectual property protection covering certain of Nuvera\u2019s technologies. Nuvera\u2019s fuel-cell technology may not be economically viable if the Company is unable to prevent others from infringing or successfully challenging the validity of certain patents and other intellectual property rights attributable to Nuvera.\nCertain members of the Company\u2019s extended founding family own a substantial amount of its Class A and Class B common stock and, if they were to act in concert, could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant corporate actions.\nThe Company has two classes of common stock: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to cast one vote per share and, as of December 31, 2015, accounted for approximately 24 percent of the voting power of the Company. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to cast ten votes per share and, as of December 31, 2015, accounted for the remaining voting power of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, certain members of the Company\u2019s extended founding family held approximately 26 percent of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A common stock and approximately 84 percent of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class B common stock. On the basis of this common stock ownership, certain members of the Company\u2019s extended founding family could have exercised 70 percent of the Company\u2019s\ntotal voting power. Although there is no voting agreement among such extended family members, in writing or otherwise, if they were to act in concert, they could control the outcome of director elections and other stockholder votes on significant corporate actions, such as certain amendments to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and sales of the Company or substantially all of its assets. Because certain members of the Company\u2019s extended founding family could prevent other stockholders from exercising significant influence over significant corporate actions, the Company may be a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock.", "PERMNO": 13577, "SIC": 3537, "TIC": "HY"}
