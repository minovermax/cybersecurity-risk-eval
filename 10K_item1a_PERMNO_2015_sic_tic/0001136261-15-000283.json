{"cik": "1477246", "company": "S&W Seed Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\tRisk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur earnings can be negatively impacted by declining demand brought on by varying factors, many of which are out of our control.\nA variety of factors, notably a severe downturn in the domestic dairy industry, could have a negative effect on sales of alfalfa hay, and as a result, the demand for our alfalfa seed in the domestic market. At times, including fiscal 2014, the demand for our seed has also declined in the Middle East as the result of common, uncertified seed flooding the market at lower prices than those at which we were willing to sell our certified seed. In fiscal 2015, many of these factors started to correct themselves, but these circumstances could continue or reoccur, and our earnings could be negatively impacted. In addition, demand for our products could decline because of other supply and quality issues or for any other reason, including products of competitors that might be considered superior by end users. A decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings may also be sensitive to fluctuations in market prices.\nMarket prices for our alfalfa seed can be impacted by factors such as the quality of the seed and the available supply, including whether lower quality, uncertified seed is available. Growing conditions, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests and the adventitious presence of GMO, are primary factors influencing the quality and quantity of the seed and, therefore, the market price at which we can sell our seed to our customers. A decrease in the prices received for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings are vulnerable to cost increases.\nFuture increase in costs such as the costs of growing seed through growers or by us internally, could cause our margins and earnings to decline unless we are able to pass along the increased price of production to our customers. We may not be able to increase the price of our seed sufficiently to maintain our margins and earnings in the future.\nOur inventory of seed can be adversely affected by the market price being paid for other crops.\nOur seed production, both in the U.S. and Australia, substantially relies on unaffiliated growers to grow our proprietary seed and to sell it to us at negotiated prices each year. Growers have a choice of what crops to plant. If a particular crop is paying a materially higher price than has been paid in the past, growers may decide to not grow alfalfa seed in favor of receiving a higher return from an alternative crop planted on the same acreage. If our growers decline to a significant degree to plant the acreage on which we rely, and if we cannot find other growers to plant the lost acreage, our inventory of seed could be insufficient to satisfy the needs of our customers, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could materially decline. In addition, our customers could look to other suppliers for their seed if we cannot satisfy their requirements, and we may not be able to regain them as customers once our inventory levels have returned to normal.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, crop disease, pests and other natural conditions can impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nAlfalfa seed, our primary product, is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are common but difficult to predict. In addition, alfalfa seed is vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and climatic conditions. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and quality. After the 2015 crop harvest, we will no longer be direct farming our proprietary seed. However, these factors can nevertheless directly impact us by decreasing the quality and yields of our seed and reducing our inventory and the supply of seed we sell to our customers.\nThese factors can increase costs, decrease revenue and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause our alfalfa seed business is highly seasonal, our revenue, cash flows from operations and operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.\nWe expect that the majority of our revenues will continue to be generated from our alfalfa seed business. Our alfalfa seed business is highly seasonal, with the highest concentration of sales occurring during the third and fourth fiscal quarters. The seasonal nature of our operations results in significant fluctuations in our working capital during the growing and selling cycles. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant variability in net sales, operating cash flows and net income on a quarterly basis.\nWe have had a material concentration of revenue from a small group of customers that fluctuates, and the loss of any of these customers in any quarter could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.\nOn a historical basis, we have experienced a material concentration of revenue from a small group of customers. This concentration fluctuates from quarter to quarter, depending on our customer's specific requirements, which are themselves cyclical. However, in any particular quarter, we generally have a small group of customers that accounts for a substantial portion of that quarter's revenue. Most of these customers are not contractually obligated to purchase seed from us. The loss of one or more of these customers on a quarterly basis, when taken year over year, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows. We could also suffer a material adverse effect from any losses arising from a major customer's disputes regarding shipments,\nproduct quality or related matters, or from our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer. There are no assurances that we will be able to maintain our current customer relationships or that they will continue to purchase our seed in the current projected quantities. Any failure to do so may materially adversely impact our business.\nBecause we depend on a core group of significant customers, our sales, cash flows from operations and results of operations may be negatively affected if our key customers reduce the amount of products they purchase from us.\nWe rely upon a small group of customers for a large percentage of our net revenue. Overall, two customers accounted for 49% of our fiscal 2015 revenue. We expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future.\nThe loss of, or a significant adverse change in, our relationship with these customers, or any other major customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows. The loss of, or a reduction in orders from, any significant customers, losses arising from customers' disputes regarding shipments, product quality, or related matters, or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could have a material adverse effect on us. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain the relationships with our major customers or that they will continue to purchase our seed in the quantities that we expect and rely upon. If we cannot do so, our results of operations could suffer.\nBecause we do not grow most of the alfalfa seed that we sell, we are substantially dependent on our network of growers, and our sales, cash flows from operations and results of operations may be negatively affected if we are unable to maintain an adequate network of contract growers to supply our seed requirements.\nAfter completion of the fall 2015 harvest, we no longer will be growing any of the alfalfa seed that we sell, and therefore, we are entirely dependent upon our network of growers. While we have some supply contracts with our growers of two or three years, many of our grower contracts cover only one year, which makes us particularly vulnerable to factors beyond our control. Events such as a shift in pricing caused by an increase in the value of commodity crops other than seed crops, increase in land prices, unexpected competition or reduced water availability could disrupt our supply chain. Any of these disruptions could limit the supply of seed that we obtain in any given year, adversely affecting supply and thereby lowering revenues. Such disruption could also damage our customer relationships and loyalty to us if we cannot supply the quantity of seed expected by them. In particular, we have had some of our California growers decide to not grow alfalfa seed due to drought conditions. This situation could reoccur and could negatively impact our revenues if we do not otherwise have sufficient seed inventory available for sale.\nSGI relies on a pool of approximately 150 Australian growers to produce its proprietary seeds. Each grower arrangement is typically made for a term of seven to ten harvests. Although SGI's grower pool is diversified, it is not without risks. Adverse agronomic or climatic factors could lead to grower exodus and negatively impact SGI's revenues if SGI does not otherwise have sufficient seed inventory available for sale.\nA lack of availability of water in the U.S. or Australia could impact our business.\nAdequate quantities and correct timing of the application of water are vital for most agriculture to thrive. Whether particular farms are experiencing water shortages depends, in large part, on their location. However, continuing drought conditions can threaten all farmland other than those properties with their own water sources. Although alfalfa seed is not a water-intensive crop, the availability or the cost of water is a factor in the planting of the alfalfa hay grown from our seed, and we have experienced a decline in the willingness of some California farmers to grow alfalfa seed as a result of the ongoing severe California drought conditions. Moreover, if the dairy farmers and others who purchase our alfalfa seed to grow hay cannot get an adequate supply of water, or if the cost of water makes it uneconomical for the farmers to grow alfalfa, we may not be able to sell our seed, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We cannot predict if water shortages will impact our business in the future, but if alfalfa hay growers are impacted by water shortages, our business could also materially decline.\nWe face intense competition, and our inability to compete effectively for any reason could adversely affect our business.\nThe alfalfa seed market is highly competitive, and our products face competition from a number of small seed companies, as well as large agricultural and biotechnology companies. We compete primarily on the basis of consistency of product quality and traits, product availability, customer service and price. Many of our competitors are, or are affiliated with, large diversified companies that have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we have. These resources give our competitors greater operating flexibility that, in certain cases, may permit them to respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry or to introduce new products more quickly and with greater marketing support. Increased competition could result in lower profit margins, substantial pricing pressure, reduced market share and lower operating cash flows. Price competition, together with other forms of competition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows.\nIf we are unable to estimate our customers' future needs accurately and to match our production to the demand of our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe sell our seed primarily to dealers and distributors who, in turn, sell primarily to hay and dairy farmers who grow hay for dairy cattle and other livestock. Due to the nature of the alfalfa seed industry, we normally produce seed according to our production plan before we sell and deliver seed to distributors and dealers. Our dealers and distributors generally make purchasing decisions for our products based on market prices, economic and weather conditions and other factors that we and our dealers and distributors may not be able to anticipate accurately in advance. If we fail to accurately estimate the volume and types of products sought by the end users and otherwise adequately manage production amounts, we may produce more seed than our dealers and distributors want, resulting in excess inventory levels. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand, which has happened in the past, we may not be able to satisfy our dealers and distributors' demand for alfalfa seed, and thus damage our customer relations and end-user loyalty. Our failure to estimate end users' future needs and to match our production to the demand of our customers may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur third-party distributors may not effectively distribute our products.\nWe depend in part on third-party distributors and strategic relationships for the marketing and selling of our products. We depend on these distributors' efforts to market our products, yet we are unable to control\ntheir efforts completely. In addition, we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 78dd-1, et seq. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products, and in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer.\nWe extend credit to our largest international customer and to certain of our other international customers, which exposes us to the difficulties of collecting our receivables in foreign jurisdictions if those customers fail to pay us.\nAlthough payment terms for our seed sales generally are 90 to120 days, we regularly extend credit to our largest international customer, Sorouh Agricultural Company, and to other international customers. Sales of our alfalfa seed varieties to Sorouh and to other international customers represented a material portion of our revenue in fiscal 2015 and that we will continue to extend credit in connection with those sales. Because these customers are located in foreign countries, collection efforts, were they to become necessary, could be much more difficult and expensive. Moreover, future political and/or economic factors, as well as future unanticipated trade regulations, could negatively impact our ability to timely collect outstanding receivables from these important customers. The extension of credit to our international customers exposes us to the risk that our seed will be delivered but that we may not receive all or a portion of the payment therefor. If these customers are unable or unwilling to fully pay for the seed they purchase on credit, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially negatively impacted. Moreover, our internal forecasts on which we make business decisions throughout the year could be severely compromised, which could, in turn, mean that we spend capital for operations, investment or otherwise that we would not have spent had we been aware that the customer would not honor its credit extension obligation.\nOur current reliance on the seed development and production business does not permit us to spread our business risks among different business segments, and thus a disruption in our seed production or the industry would harm us more immediately and directly than if we were diversified.\nWe currently operate mainly in the alfalfa seed business, and we do not expect this to change materially in the foreseeable future. Without business line diversity, we will not be able to spread the risk of our operations. Therefore, our business opportunities, revenue and income could be more immediately and directly affected by disruptions from such things as drought and disease or widespread problems affecting the alfalfa industry, payment disruptions and customer rejection of our varieties of alfalfa seed. If there is a disruption as described above, our revenue and income could be reduced, and our business operations might have to be scaled back.\nIf we fail to introduce and commercialize new alfalfa seed varieties, we may not be able to maintain market share, and our future sales may be harmed.\nThe performance of our new alfalfa seed varieties may not meet our customers' expectations, or we may not be able to introduce and commercialize specific seed varieties. Reorder rates are uncertain due to several factors, many of which are beyond our control. These include changing customer preferences, which could be further complicated by competitive price pressures, our failure to develop new products to meet the evolving demands of the end users, the development of higher-demand products by our competitors and general economic conditions. The process for new products to gain market recognition and acceptance is long and has uncertainties. If we fail to introduce and commercialize a new seed variety that meets the demand of the end user, if our competitors develop products that are favored by the end users, or if we are unable to produce our existing products in sufficient quantities, our growth prospects\nmay be materially and adversely affected, and our revenue may decline. In addition, sales of our new products could replace sales of some of our current similar products, offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction.\nThe presence of GMO alfalfa in Australia or California could impact our sales.\nGMO crops currently are prohibited in most of the international markets in which our proprietary seed is currently sold, and there are regions in the United States, including the Pacific Northwest, where even small quantities of GMO material inadvertently interspersed with conventional seed make the seed undesirable, which causes customers to look elsewhere for their alfalfa seed requirements. The greater the use of GMO seed in California and other alfalfa seed growing regions, the greater the risk that the adventitious presence of GMO material in our seed production will occur due to pollination from hay fields or other seed fields. We regularly test for the adventitious presence of GMO in our conventional seed, and we have seen a slight increase in the percentage of GMO material over the past several years. Our seed containing GMO material can only be sold domestically or in other jurisdictions that permit the importation of GMO alfalfa. If we are unable to isolate our conventional (non-GMO) seed from inadvertently being contaminated by GMO seed, we may find it more difficult to sell that seed in our key markets, which could materially adversely impact our revenue over time.\nThe stevia market may not develop as we anticipate, and therefore our continued research and development activities with respect to stevia may never become profitable to us.\nThere are a number of challenges to market acceptance of stevia as a natural, non-caloric sweetener. Stevia has its own unique flavor, which can affect the taste of some foods and beverages. A common complaint about stevia is that some of its extracts and derivatives have a bitter aftertaste, and its taste does not uniformly correspond to all regional taste preferences or combine well with some food flavors. Other factors that could impact market acceptance include the price structure compared to other sugar substitutes and availability. If the high-intensity, non-caloric sweetener market declines or if stevia fails to achieve substantially greater market acceptance than it currently enjoys, we might not ever be able to profit from our continued research and development activities relating to stevia or any commercial applications that we derive therefrom. Even if products conform to applicable safety and quality standards, sales could be adversely affected if consumers in target markets lose confidence in the safety, efficacy and quality of stevia. Adverse publicity about stevia or stevia-based products may discourage consumers from buying products that contain stevia. Any of these developments could adversely impact the future amount of dry leaf stevia, processed stevia leaves or extract we are able to sell, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to acquire sufficient raw materials or produce sufficient finished product, we will not be able to meet the demands of our customers.\nWe must acquire sufficient alfalfa seed to meet the demands of our customers. An alfalfa seed shortage could result in loss of sales and damage to our reputation. Because we no longer grow any of our seed ourselves, our proprietary seed is only available from our contract growers. Therefore, if our growers become unable or unwilling to produce the required commercial quantities of alfalfa seed on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we will likely be unable to meet customer demand. The failure to satisfy our customers not only could adversely impact our financial results but could irreparably harm our reputation.\nThe loss of key employees or the failure to attract qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to run our business.\nThe loss of any of our current executives, key employees or key advisors, or the failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain additional key employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Operating Officer, as well as certain other employees, any employee could leave our employ at any time if he chose to do so. We do not carry \"key person\" insurance on the lives of any of our management team. As we develop additional capabilities, we may require more skilled personnel who must be highly skilled and have a sound understanding of our industry, business or processing requirements. Recruiting skilled personnel is highly competitive. Although to date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, there can be no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain the personnel needed for our business. The failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to manage expansion of our operations effectively.\nWe expect our operations to grow rapidly in the near future, both as we expand our historical alfalfa seed business both domestically and internationally through internal grown and synergistic acquisitions and increase our growers' production. We currently face these challenges in connection with the integration of the business operations we acquired from Pioneer, which expanded our operations into five states and three Canadian provinces. These efforts will require the addition of employees, expansion of facilities and greater oversight, perhaps in diverse locations. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute on our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures, and we may have difficulties maintaining and updating the internal procedures and the controls necessary to meet the planned expansion of our overall business.\nOur management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers, suppliers and third parties as well as attract new customers and suppliers. We expect that our sales and marketing costs will increase as we grow our product lines and as we increase our sales efforts in new and existing markets. Our current and planned operations, personnel, systems and internal procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future growth.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses we have recently acquired and may acquire in the future with our current management and structure.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may acquire additional businesses, product lines or other assets. We may not be able to locate or make suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms, and future acquisitions may not be effectively and profitably integrated into our business. Our failure to successfully complete the integration of the businesses we acquire could have an adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Integration challenges may include the following:\nassimilating the acquired operations products and personnel with our existing operations, products and personnel;\nestimating the capital, personnel and equipment required for the acquired businesses based on the historical experience of management with the businesses they are familiar with;\nminimizing potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with other suppliers and customers;\ndeveloping and marketing the new products and services;\nentering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\ncoordinating our efforts throughout various distant localities and time zones.\nThe diversion of management's attention and costs associated with acquisitions may have a negative impact on our business.\nIf management's attention is diverted from the management of our existing businesses as a result of its efforts in evaluating and negotiating new acquisitions and strategic transactions, the prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations of our existing businesses may suffer. We also may incur unanticipated costs in connection with pursuing acquisitions and strategic transactions.\nSGI's grower pool is dependent on a limited number of milling facilities to process its seed, with particular dependence on a dominant operator whose commercial interests may be adverse to SGI.\nOnly five milling facilities are regularly used by SGI's grower pool to clean and process SGI seed. Should one or more of these facilities become unusable, there could be a significant effect on SGI's ability to get its Australian seed to market in a timely manner or at all. SGI's growers use Tatiara Seeds Pty Ltd (\"Tatiara\") to process approximately 70% of seed grown for SGI. The owner of Tatiara has begun to sell his own common seed and is now a competitor of SGI. This competing seed business creates a potential conflict of interest for Tatiara in the care and handling of SGI's product.\nSGI is thinly capitalized and may become dependent upon us for financing.\nBecause SGI has relatively little net working capital, it is substantially dependent upon its credit arrangement with NAB to purchase its seed inventory. SGI has breached debt covenants relating to this credit arrangement in the past, and if future breaches of this credit arrangement or other reasons cause this credit arrangement to become unavailable to SGI, SGI may become reliant on us to finance its operations or for financial guarantees. We currently are a guarantor on SGI's NAB credit facility. SGI's financial dependency upon us could have a negative adverse effect upon our financial condition.\nSGI is dependent on a pool of seed growers and a favorable pricing model.\nSGI relies on a pool of approximately 150 Australian contract growers to produce its proprietary seeds. In this system, growers contract with SGI to grow SGI's seed for terms of seven to ten years in the case of alfalfa and two to three years for white clover. SGI uses a staggered payment system with the growers of its alfalfa and white clover; the payment amounts are based upon an estimated budget price, or EBP, for compliant seed. EBP is a forecast of the final price that SGI believes will be achieved taking into account prevailing and predicted market conditions at the time the estimate is made. Following the grower's delivery of uncleaned seed to a milling facility, SGI typically pays 40% of the EBP to the grower based on pre-cleaning weight. Following this initial payment and prior to the final payment, SGI will make a series of scheduled progress payments and, if applicable, a bonus payment for \"first grade\" alfalfa seed. The final price payable to each grower (and therefore the total price) is dependent upon and subject to adjustment based upon the clean weight of the seed grown, on the average price at which SGI sells the pooled seed and other costs incurred by SGI. Accordingly, the total price paid by SGI to its growers may be more or less than EBP. This arrangement exposes SGI's business to unique risks, including, the\npotential for current growers to make collective demands that are unfavorable to SGI and the potential for our competitors to offer more favorable terms for seed production, including fixed (instead of variable) payment terms.\nSGI's reliance upon an estimated purchase price to growers could result in changes in estimates in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur subsidiary SGI does not fix the final price for seed payable to its growers until the completion of a given year's sales cycle, pursuant to the standard contract production agreement. We record an estimated unit price and accordingly inventory, cost of goods sold and gross profits are based upon management's best estimate of the final purchase price to our SGI growers. To the extent the estimated purchase price varies from the final purchase price for seed, the adjustment to actual could materially impact the results in the period when the difference between estimates and actuals are identified. If the actual purchase price is in excess of our estimated purchase price, this would negatively impact our financial results including a reduction in gross profits and net income.\nThe value of SGI's rights under the Australian Plant Breeder's Rights (PBR) Act could diminish due to technological developments or challenges by competitors, making its proprietary alfalfa seed varieties less competitive.\nSGI is substantially dependent upon the PBR Act for the protection of its proprietary varieties. Currently, SGI's SuperSiriver, SuperSequel, SuperAurora, SuperHaifa, SuperLadino, SuperHuia, SuperSonic, SuperStar, SuperSiriver II and SuperNova varieties are protected under the PBR Act. If any competitors of SGI independently develop new seeds that customers or end users determine are better than SGI's existing varieties, such developments could adversely affect SGI's competitive position.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe may find it necessary or advisable to raise additional capital in the future, whether to enhance our working capital, fund acquisitions or for other reasons. If we are required or desire to raise additional capital in the future, such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or available at all, may be dilutive to our existing stockholders if in the form of equity financing, or contain restrictions on the operation of our business if in the form of debt financing. If we fail to obtain additional capital as and when required, such failure could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in government policies and laws could adversely affect international sales and therefore our financial results.\nHistorically, sales to our distributors who sell our proprietary alfalfa seed varieties outside the U.S. have constituted a substantial portion of our annual revenue. We anticipate that sales into international markets will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our total sales and that continued growth and profitability will require further international expansion, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. Our financial results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of U.S. and non-U.S. governments, agencies and similar organizations. These conditions include but are not limited to changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, burdensome taxes and tariffs and other trade barriers. International\nrisks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities and war, could lead to reduced distribution of our products into international markets and reduced profitability associated with such sales.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.\nOur operations, both inside and outside the United States, are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. Although we sell seed to various regions of the world, a large percentage of our sales outside the United States in fiscal year 2015, including those of SGI, were principally to customers in the Middle East, North Africa and Mexico. Accordingly, developments in those parts of the world generally have a more significant effect on our operations than developments in other places. Our operations outside the United States are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values and foreign-currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Acts of terror or war may impair our ability to operate in particular countries or regions, and may impede the flow of goods and services between countries. Customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodity at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. Further, changes in exchange rates may affect our net income, the book value of our assets outside the United States, and our stockholders' equity. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies, including their suppliers, distributors and other commercial partners, from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in the countries in which we distribute products. We have adopted formal policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws. If our employees or other agents, including our distributors or suppliers, are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental regulation affecting our alfalfa seed or stevia products could negatively impact our business.\nAs an agricultural company, we are subject to evolving environmental laws and regulations by federal and state governments. Federal laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Federal Seed Act, and\npotentially regulations of the FDA. In addition, the State of California regulates our application of agricultural chemicals in connection with seed harvest.\nOur Australian operations are also subject to a number of environmental laws, regulations and policies, including in particular the Environment Protection Act 1993 (SA), the Agricultural and Veterinary Products (Control of Use) Act 2002 (SA), the Genetically Modified Crops Management Act 2004 (SA), the Dangerous Substances Act 1979 (SA), the Controlled Substances Act 1984 (SA) and related regulations and policies. These laws regulate matters including air quality, water quality and the use and disposal of agricultural chemicals.\nOur failure to comply with these laws and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, it is possible that future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder, and further restrictions on the use of agricultural chemicals, could result in increased compliance costs which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInsurance covering defective seed claims may become unavailable or be inadequate.\nDefective seed could result in insurance claims and negative publicity. Although we carry general liability insurance to cover defective seed claims, such coverage may become unavailable or be inadequate. Even if coverage is offered, it may be at a price and on terms not acceptable to us. If claims exceed coverage limits, or if insurance is not available to us, the occurrence of significant claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to product quality claims, which may cause us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely against us, may cause us to pay significant damage awards.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to our seed or dried stevia leaf quality. The defense of these proceedings and claims can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert efforts and resources of our management personnel. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could subject us to significant liability and damage our market reputation and prevent us from achieving increased sales and market share. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase of our products.\nThe recent global economic downturn has significantly impacted the agricultural industry which in turn has negatively affected our business.\nThe global economic downturn of the past several years has significantly impacted the agricultural industry, with many farmers losing their farms or laying fallow their fields, as well as other negative impacts. The full effect of this global economic downturn on growers, customers, vendors and other business partners cannot be known with any certainty. For example, major customers may have financial challenges unrelated to us that could result in a decrease in their business with us or, in extreme cases, cause them to file for bankruptcy protection. Similarly, parties to contracts may be forced to breach their obligations. Although we exercise prudent oversight of the financial strength of our major business partners and seek to diversify our risk to any single business partner, there can be no assurance that a significant grower, customer or other business partner that may be unable to meet its contractual commitments to us. Similarly, continued stresses and pressures that could have wide-ranging negative effects on our industry's future.\nCapital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our growers and customers.\nThe capital and credit markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption over the past several years, making it more difficult for companies to access those markets. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, recent access to the capital market and our lines of credit will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets may impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing, if we need to access the credit market. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our growers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a continued slowdown in the general economy.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business and prospects may be harmed.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent upon the proprietary nature of the seeds, seedlings, processes, technologies and materials owned by or used by us or our growers. If any competitors independently develop new traits, seeds, seedlings, processes or technologies that customers or end users determine are better than our existing products, such developments could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition to patent protection for some of our alfalfa seed varieties that we acquired from DuPont Pioneer, we guard our proprietary property by exercising a high degree of control over the alfalfa seed supply chain from our S&W varieties, as well as over our stevia material. In Australia, SGI has secured protection under the PBR Act for its most popular varieties. However, even with these measures in place, it would be possible for persons with access to our seed or plants grown from our seed to reproduce and market our proprietary seed varieties, which could significantly harm our business and our reputation. Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary property and determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of competitors. Intellectual property litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management and other resources. If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors could market products that compete with our proprietary products without obtaining a license from us.\nWe currently depend on Pioneer for substantially all of our sales of dormant alfalfa seed and have agreed to limitations on other sales of the seed varieties we sell to Pioneer. Any decline in Pioneer's demand will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur distribution agreement with Pioneer limits our ability to otherwise sell the specific varieties of dormant alfalfa seed we supply to Pioneer in the sales territory covered by Pioneer. The Pioneer sales territory includes the United States, Europe and many other of the principal dormant alfalfa seed markets. In these markets, our ability to sell the specified varieties through distribution channels other than Pioneer is limited to certain blended, private label and variety not stated forms and cannot exceed a specified percentage of Pioneer's demand. As result of these limitations, sales to Pioneer represent and for the foreseeable future will continue to represent the vast majority of all of our sales of dormant alfalfa seed. Any decline in Pioneer's demand for our dormant alfalfa seed products will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nPioneer may purchase alfalfa seed from other sources and reduce their purchase commitments to us.\nUnder our distribution agreement with Pioneer, Pioneer has made minimum purchase commitments for our dormant alfalfa seed products that extend through September 30, 2024. However, there are\ncircumstances under which Pioneer's is permitted to purchase seed from other sources and reduce its purchase commitments to us, including:\nProduction Shortfalls. If in any year we fail to produce an adequate supply of alfalfa seed to meet Pioneer's demand and we are unable to source alternative supply, Pioneer may purchase seed from third parties to meet the shortfall in our production.\nNew Products. If a third party offers for license a new product (a new transgenic and/or native trait for dormant alfalfa seed) that offers a superior value pricing opportunity compared to varieties we offer and Pioneer wishes to sell the new product, then we would have a one-year period to obtain rights to produce and sell the new product to Pioneer. If we fail to obtain rights to the new product within the one-year period or otherwise don't offer the new product on substantially the same terms as offered by a third party, then Pioneer would be free to purchase the new product from the third party and Pioneer's minimum purchase commitment to us would be reduced by the amount of the new product purchased.\nGMO-Traited Varieties. Unless and until we complete the transactions contemplated under our second asset purchase agreement with Pioneer. Pioneer may purchase certain GMO-traited varieties of alfalfa seed from third parties. See \"Risk Factors-If we do not complete the acquisition under our second asset purchase agreement, Pioneer may pursue alternative production arrangements for its GMO-traited varieties and reduce purchases from us.\"\nAny reduction in Pioneer's purchase commitment to us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are committed to sell dormant alfalfa seed to Pioneer at initial fixed prices with fixed subsequent maximum price increases per year. Increases in our costs of production at rates higher than our contractual ability to increase prices would erode our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnder our distribution agreement with Pioneer, we are committed to sell dormant alfalfa seed at initial fixed prices for the 2015 and 2016 sales years. In subsequent sales years, we can increase our prices up to a fixed percentage per year by variety. Although Pioneer has agreed to discuss in good faith an increase in the fixed maximum percentage price increase cap for any sales year in which an increase in grower compensation costs due to changes in market conditions cause our total production costs to increase at a percentage exceeding the amount of the cap, we cannot be certain that any such discussions will result in additional pricing flexibility for us. If our grower compensation costs or other productions costs increase at a rate greater than the fixed maximum percentage increase per year, our profit margins would erode and we could potentially be required to sell product at a loss. Any such change in our cost structure would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we do not complete the acquisition under the second asset purchase agreement, Pioneer may pursue alternative production arrangements for its GMO-traited varieties and reduce purchases from us.\nWe are currently producing certain GMO-traited varieties for Pioneer under our production agreement with Pioneer. The production agreement expires on December 31, 2017 or upon the earlier closing of our acquisition of certain GMO germplasm and related assets from Pioneer pursuant to a second asset purchase agreement. However, we may never enter into the second asset purchase agreement or close the acquisition of Pioneer's GMO germplasm and related assets. If Pioneer and we do not obtain certain third-party consents and agreements on or before November 30, 2017 (or certain other conditions above are not\nsatisfied), then the obligations of the parties to enter into the second asset purchase agreement will terminate and we will have no right or obligation to acquire the GMO germplasm and related assets. In that case, our production agreement with Pioneer (relating to GMO-traited varieties) would terminate on December 31, 2017, Pioneer would be free to pursue alternative production arrangements for the GMO-traited varieties, and Pioneer's minimum purchase commitments to us under the distribution agreement would be materially reduced.\nIf we fail to perform our obligations under our distribution agreement and production agreement with Pioneer, Pioneer could terminate the agreements and reduce or eliminate purchases of alfalfa seed from us, and we could be exposed to claims for damages.\nThe distribution agreement and the production agreement impose numerous obligations on us relating to, among other things, product and service quality and compliance with laws and third party obligations. Both the distribution agreement and the production agreement permit Pioneer to terminate the agreement if we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure the breach within a 60-day notice period, or in the case of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events. Pioneer can also immediately terminate the production agreement if we breach certain agreements or policies with third parties related to the production of GMO-traited varieties. If Pioneer terminates either the distribution agreement or the production agreement, Pioneer could reduce or eliminate altogether its purchase of alfalfa seed from us, and we could be left with inventory of seed that it would be difficult or impossible for us to dispose of on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, we could be exposed to significant claims for damages to Pioneer if the termination of an agreement results from our material breach of the agreement.\nIf we do not meet seed planting and production commitments to Pioneer, we could incur significant financial penalties.\nUnder our distribution agreement with Pioneer, if we fail to plant sufficient acreage (based on historical yields), together with any carryover inventory, to meet 110% of Pioneer's demand and we actually fail to meet Pioneer's demand, then we are obligated to pay Pioneer a cash penalty based on the amount of the shortfall. A similar penalty provision applies only with respect to 2017 under our Production Agreement with Pioneer, if we fail to plant or cause to be planted a specified number of planting acres.\nWe contract all of our production of dormant alfalfa seed with third-party growers. If, in any year, we are unable to obtain sufficient grower commitments to meet Pioneer's demand, we could be obligated to pay significant financial penalties to Pioneer.\nRisks Related to Investment in Our Securities\nThe value of our common stock can be volatile.\nOur common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The overall market and the price of our common stock can fluctuate greatly. The trading price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors, including but not limited to:\neconomic status and trends in the dairy industry, which underlies domestic demand for our alfalfa seed;\nmarket conditions for alfalfa seed in the Middle East and Africa, where a substantial amount of our seed historically has been purchased by end users;\nquarterly fluctuations in our operating results;\nour ability to meet the earnings estimates and other performance expectations of investors or financial analysts;\nfluctuations in the stock prices of our peer companies or in stock markets in general; and\ngeneral economic or political conditions.\nOur quarter-to-quarter performance may vary substantially, and this variance, as well as general market conditions, may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate greatly and potentially expose us to litigation.\nOur alfalfa seed business, our primary source of revenue, is highly seasonal because it is tied to the growing and harvesting seasons. If sales in particular quarters are lower than expected, our operating results for these quarters could cause our share price to decline.\nOur future expense estimates are based, in large part, on estimates of future revenue, which is difficult to predict. We expect to continue to make significant expenditures in order to expand production, sales, marketing and administrative systems and processes. We may be unable to, or may elect not to, adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall. If our increased expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue in the same quarter, our quarterly operating results would be harmed.\nIn one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of investors or analysts, and the trading price of our securities may decline as a consequence. We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be a good indication of our future performance and should not be relied upon to predict the future performance of our stock price.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have often been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf we issue shares of preferred stock, the holdings of those owning our common stock could be diluted or subordinated to the rights of the holders of preferred stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized by our articles of incorporation to establish classes or series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Any shares of preferred stock so issued could have priority over our common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. Although we have no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock or to adopt any new series, preferences or other classification of preferred stock, any such action by our board of directors or issuance of preferred stock by us could dilute your investment in our securities or subordinate your holdings to the higher priority rights of the holders of shares of preferred stock issued in the future.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nWe routinely release guidance in our quarterly earnings releases, our quarterly earnings conference calls and in other forums we consider appropriate. Such guidance regarding our future performance represents our management's estimates as of the date of release or other communication. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, is based on projections prepared by our management. These\nprojections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections, and accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. If we issue guidance, we will generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges that are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we would release guidance would be to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance, when given, is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release or other communication. Actual results will vary from our guidance, and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon, or otherwise consider, our guidance in making an investment decision about our securities.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. If we do not pay cash dividends, our stock may be less valuable to investors because a return on their investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nAnti-takeover provisions and our right to issue preferred stock could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that would make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, including a provision that our board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, certain anti-takeover provisions of Nevada law, if and when applicable, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nRisks Relating to the Private Placement of Debentures and Warrants\nOn December 31, 2014, we issued an aggregate of $27,000,000 in principal amount of 8% Senior Secured Convertible Debentures and common stock purchase warrants for the purchase of up to 2,699,999 shares of our common stock. The following are identified risks that are specifically associated with the issuance of these securities.\nIf the price adjustment provision of the Debentures and Warrants and/or the weighted average dilution provision of the Warrants is triggered, there would be a decrease in conversion and/or exercise prices.\nAlthough the initial conversion price of the Debentures and the initial exercise price of the Warrants is $5.00, which was a premium to the price on closing of $4.00, both securities contain provisions that could adjust downward the respective conversion and exercise prices. Both securities contain a ratchet provision under which the conversion and exercise prices could be adjusted to as low as $4.15 (subject to adjustment for stock splits and similar events) if, on September 30, 2015, our stock price is below the then-conversion/exercise price. The adjusted conversion and exercises prices, if applicable, will be based on a formula specified in the securities based on the lowest 10 day average VWAP of our common stock over a 20-day lookback period. If the price adjusts, we could be required to issue a greater number of shares pursuant to the Debentures and could ultimately raise less money upon exercise of the warrants.\nIn addition, the Warrant also contains a weighted average price protection provision that is operable for the first three years of the term of the Warrants.\nOur stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after issuance of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Debentures and exercise of the Warrants and may exercise less influence over management.\nIn the event the holders of the Debentures and Warrants elect to exercise their conversion and/or exercise rights pursuant to these securities during the remainder of the term thereof, and, without taking into account any adjustment to the conversion price of the Debentures, an aggregate of 3,655,172 shares of our common stock could be issued upon conversion and exercise of the securities, based on a remaining $18,275,862 in principal amount of the Debentures at September 23, 2015.\nBased on the current number of shares outstanding of 13,463,455 on September 22, 2015, the new issuances would represent 21.4%, of the shares outstanding after these issuances. In addition, although we have no intention of doing so, to the extent we issue shares to service the debt, the ownership percentages of the new investors would increase incrementally. As a result, our current stockholders as a group would own a substantially smaller interest in us and may have less influence on our management and policies than they now have.\nOur repayment obligations under the Debentures are secured by a lien on our assets.\nOur obligations to the holders of the Debentures are secured by a lien on all of our assets pursuant to a security agreement, which was entered into with respect to the issuance of the Debentures. This lien is subordinate only to the lien of certain permitted senior creditors, pursuant to an inter-creditor and subordination agreement, which was entered into simultaneously with the security agreement. If we default under the terms of the Debentures or under the terms of any permitted senior indebtedness (which is an event of default under the Debentures), the holders of the Debentures may exercise various remedies against us, including acceleration of the entire remaining principal amount of the Debentures and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and remedies against our collateral. An acceleration of the Debentures or an exercise of remedies against our assets as collateral could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business or could force us to invoke legal measures to protect our business, including, but not limited to, for filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.", "PERMNO": 93434, "SIC": 100, "TIC": "SANW"}
