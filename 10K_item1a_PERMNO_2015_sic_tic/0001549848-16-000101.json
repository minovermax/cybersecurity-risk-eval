RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and investments in us. Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the discussion of other factors that could affect us or investments in us included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. These known material risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nRisks Inherent in Our Business\nWe may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner and its affiliates, to enable us to pay a distribution to our unitholders.\nIn October 2015, we announced the suspension of our distribution. We may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay a distribution. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nthe amount of frac sand we are able to excavate and process, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating difficulties and unusual or unfavorable geologic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe volume of frac sand we are able to buy and sell;\n\u2022\nthe price at which we are able to buy and sell frac sand;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of natural gas or electricity;\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing economic conditions, including the extent of changes in natural gas, crude oil and other commodity prices;\n\u2022\nunanticipated ground, grade or water conditions;\n\u2022\ninclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of climate change;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining and renewing environmental permits;\n\u2022\nindustrial accidents;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to the mining and hydraulic fracturing industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of litigation, claims or assessments, including unasserted claims;\n\u2022\ninability to acquire or maintain necessary permits, licenses or other approvals, including mining or water rights;\n\u2022\nfacility shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;\n\u2022\nreduction in the amount of water available for processing;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties or failures;\n\u2022\ninability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes and disputes with our third-party excavation contractor;\n\u2022\nlate delivery of supplies;\n\u2022\ndifficulty collecting receivables;\n\u2022\ninability of our customers to take delivery;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of transportation;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions or other accidents;\n\u2022\ncave-ins, pit wall failures or rock falls;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the political environment of the drilling basis in which we and our customers operate; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the railroad infrastructure, price, capacity and availability, including the potential for rail line washouts.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of capital expenditures we make;\n\u2022\nthe cost of acquisitions, including any drop-down acquisitions from our sponsor;\n\u2022\nour debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our working capital needs;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in debt agreements to which we are a party; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash reserves established by our general partner.\nThe amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which may prevent us from making cash distributions during periods when we record net income.\nThe amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow, including cash flow from reserves and working capital or other borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may pay cash distributions during periods when we record net losses for financial accounting purposes and may not pay cash distributions during periods when we record net income.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth would be limited, and any acquisitions we make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash generated from operations on a per unit basis.\nA portion of our strategy to grow our business and increase distributions to unitholders is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in our cash available for distribution per unit. If we are unable to make acquisitions from third parties, including from our sponsor and its affiliates, because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts, we are unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or we are outbid by competitors, our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited. Furthermore, even if we do consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, they may in fact result in a decrease in our cash available for distribution per unit. Any acquisition involves potential risks, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ninaccurate assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022\ninability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\ninability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our business and newly acquired assets;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022\nmistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and\n\u2022\ncustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.\nOur long-term business and financial performance depends on the level of drilling and completion activity in the oil and natural gas industry.\nOur primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time existing customer contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation, renewal or replacement. Our ability to renew existing customer contracts or enter into new customer contracts on favorable terms is dependent on the market for frac sand at such times. Demand for frac sand is materially dependent on the levels of activity in natural gas and oil exploration, development and production, and more specifically, the number of natural gas and oil wells completed in geological formations where sand-based proppants are used in hydraulic fracturing treatments and the amount of frac sand customarily used in the completion of such wells.\nThe number of wells drilled for natural gas decreased during 2015 to its lowest level in 13 years as a result of decreasing natural gas prices. The number of wells drilled for oil was also decreasing dramatically during 2015 as a result of significantly lower prices for oil. In 2016, the oil and gas rig count has continued to decline to its lowest level since 1999 as fears of continued oversupply, reduced international demand and increased supply from OPEC countries, particularly Iran, have pressured oil prices to its lowest level since 2003. This trend could result in an additional decline in the number of oil and gas wells drilled from current levels.\nOil and natural gas producers\u2019 expectations for lower market prices for oil and natural gas, as well as the limited availability of capital for operating and capital expenditures, has caused them to curtail spending and may cause them to further curtail spending, thereby reducing hydraulic fracturing activity and the demand for frac sand. Industry conditions that impact the activity levels of oil and natural gas producers are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nworldwide political, military, and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices; and\n\u2022\npotential acceleration of development of alternative energy sources.\nCrude oil prices declined significantly in 2015, and were negatively affected by a combination of factors. Downward pressure on commodity prices has continued in early 2016 and could continue for the foreseeable future. A prolonged reduction in natural gas and oil prices would generally depress the level of natural gas and oil exploration, development, production and well completion activity and could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce. In addition, any future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are developed (particularly in the Marcellus and Utica shales where a substantial portion of our distribution network is focused), whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, even in a stronger natural gas and oil price environment. If there is a decrease in the demand for frac sand, we may be unable to renew contracts for our products, be forced to renegotiate our existing contracts, or be forced to reduce the prices at which we enter into new contracts, any of which would reduce the amount of cash we generate.\nIn addition, the price we receive for sales of our frac sand may be impacted by short term fluctuations in the market for frac sand, and any negative fluctuations in this market could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe majority of our sales are generated under contracts with oil field service company customers. The loss of a contract or customer, a significant reduction in purchases by any customer, our customers' failure to comply with contract terms, or our inability to renegotiate, renew or replace our existing contracts on favorable terms could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of January 1, 2016, we were contracted to sell raw frac sand under long-term supply agreements to customers with remaining terms ranging from 24 to 67 months. More than 50% of our volumes are sold to two of our customers.\nSome of our customers could exit the pressure pumping business or be acquired by other companies that purchase the same products and services we provide from other third-party providers. Our current customers also may seek to acquire frac sand from other providers that offer more competitive pricing or capture and develop their own sources of frac sand. The loss of a customer or contract, or a reduction in the amount of frac sand purchased by any customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2015, as a result of the market dynamics existing during the year, we began providing contract customers with temporary pricing discounts and/or make-whole waivers, in certain circumstances in exchange for, among other things, additional term and/or volume. Because we continue to engage in discussions with our customers, the nature, extent and duration of these pricing discounts and make-whole waivers are not certain and we may deliver sand at prices or at volumes below those provided for in our existing contracts. In addition, our customers may fail to comply with the terms of their existing contracts. Our enforcement of specific contract terms may be limited by market dynamics and other factors. Our customers\u2019 failure to comply with contract terms and our limited enforcement thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUpon the expiration of our current supply agreements, our customers may not continue to purchase the same levels of our frac sand due to a variety of reasons. In addition, we may choose to renegotiate our existing contracts on less favorable terms or at reduced volumes in order to preserve relationships with our customers. In addition, upon the expiration of our current contract terms, we may be unable to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us, or at all. The demand for frac sand or prevailing prices at the time our current supply agreements expire may render entry into new long-term supply agreements difficult or impossible. Any renegotiation of our contracts on less favorable terms, or inability to enter into new contracts on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration of our current contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn increase in the supply of raw frac sand having similar characteristics as the raw frac sand we produce could make it more difficult for us to renew or replace our existing contracts on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe believe that the supply of raw frac sand had not kept pace with the increasing demand for raw frac sand until recently, which has been a contributing factor to steadily increasing prices for raw frac sand over the last decade. If significant new reserves of raw frac sand are discovered and developed, and those frac sands have similar characteristics to the raw frac sand we produce, we may be unable to renew or replace our existing contracts at favorable pricing, or at all. Specifically, if high quality frac sand becomes more readily available, our customers may not be willing to enter into long-term contracts, or may demand lower prices, or both, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows over the long-term.\nOur long-term contracts may preclude us from taking advantage of increasing prices for frac sand or mitigating the effect of increased operational costs during the term of our long-term contracts, even though certain volumes under our long-term contracts are subject to annual fixed price escalators.\nThe long-term supply contracts we have may negatively impact our results of operations. Our long-term contracts require our customers to pay a specified price for a specified volume of frac sand each month. As a result, in periods with increasing prices, our sales may not keep pace with market prices.\nAdditionally, if our operational costs increase during the terms of our long-term supply contracts, we may not be able to pass any of those increased costs to our customers. If we are unable to otherwise mitigate these increased operational costs, our net income and available cash for distributions could decline.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results and cash available for distribution.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, whose operations are concentrated in a single industry, the global oilfield services industry. In particular, as a result of volatility in oil and natural gas prices and ongoing uncertainty of the global economic environment in light of the recent decline in oil prices, we are unable to determine whether our customers will be able to fulfill their existing commitments or access financing necessary to fund their current or future obligations. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use the production could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nWe may be adversely affected by decreased demand for raw frac sand due to the development of either effective alternative proppants or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.\nRaw frac sand is a proppant used in the completion and re-completion of oil and natural gas wells to stimulate and maintain oil and natural gas production through the process of hydraulic fracturing. Raw frac sand is the most commonly used proppant and is less expensive than other proppants, such as resin-coated sand and manufactured ceramics. A significant shift in demand from frac sand to other proppants, or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could cause a decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant shift in demand from Northern White frac sand, the sole product we produce and sell, to other raw frac sand, such as brown sand, could cause a decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInaccuracies in estimates of volumes and qualities of our sand reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected production costs.\nJohn T. Boyd, our independent reserve engineers, prepared estimates of our reserves based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our engineers and geologists. However, frac sand reserve estimates are by nature imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of reserves and non-reserve frac sand deposits and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable frac sand reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future prices of frac sand, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.\nAny inaccuracy in John T. Boyd\u2019s estimates related to our frac sand reserves and non-reserve frac sand deposits could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs. For example, John T. Boyd\u2019s estimates of our proven reserves assume that our revenue and cost structure will remain relatively constant over the life of our reserves. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, some or all of our reserves may not be economically mineable, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we pay a fixed price per ton of sand excavated regardless of the quality of the frac sand, and our current customer contracts require us to deliver frac sand that meets certain specifications. If John T. Boyd\u2019s estimates of the quality of our reserves, including the volumes of the various specifications of those reserves, prove to be inaccurate, we may incur significantly higher excavation costs without corresponding increases in revenues, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligations, or our facilities may have a shorter than expected reserve life, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe majority of our sales are sourced at our production facilities located in Wyeville, Wisconsin and Augusta, Wisconsin and our sponsor's production facility located near Whitehall, Wisconsin. During 2016, we plan to source volumes through our sponsor's facility located in Blair, Wisconsin. Any adverse developments at the facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our sales are produced from our production facilities. Any adverse development at these facilities due to catastrophic events or weather, or any other event that would cause us to curtail, suspend or terminate operations at the production facilities, could result in us being unable to meet our contracted sand deliveries. If we are unable to deliver contracted volumes within three months of contract year-end, or otherwise arrange for delivery from a third party, we will be required to pay make-whole payments to our customers that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we purchase a certain amount of frac sand from our sponsor's Whitehall facility or from third parties for use in our distribution network. Upon expiration of our current contract terms with our frac sand suppliers, we may be unable to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to provide supply from our own facilities, any reduction in the amount of frac sand available for our purchase from our sponsor's facilities or third parties, renegotiation of contracts on less favorable terms, or inability to enter into new contracts on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration of our current contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and on our having renewed or received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nWe hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining, and other permits, water rights, and approvals authorizing operations at our production facilities. For our extraction and processing in Wisconsin, the permitting process is subject to federal, state and local authority. For example, on the federal level, a Mine Identification Request (MSHA Form 7000-51) must be filed and obtained before mining commences. If wetlands are implicated, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Permit is required. At the state level, a series of permits are required related to air quality, wetlands, water quality (waste water, storm water), grading permits, endangered species, archaeological assessments, and high capacity wells in addition to others depending upon site specific factors and operational detail. At the local level, zoning, building, storm water, erosion control, wellhead protection, road usage and access are all regulated and require permitting to some degree. A non-metallic mining reclamation permit is required. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.\nTitle to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights may also be disputed. Mineral properties sometimes contain claims or transfer histories that examiners cannot verify. A successful claim that we do not have title to our property or lack appropriate water rights could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop, and extract minerals, without compensation for our prior expenditures relating to such property. Our business may suffer a material adverse effect in the event we have title deficiencies.\nIn some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe do not own the land on which the majority of our destination terminal facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own the land on which the majority of our destination terminals are located and instead own leasehold interests and rights-of-way for the operation of these facilities. Upon expiration, termination or other lapse of our current leasehold terms, we may be unable to renew our existing leases or rights-of-way on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any renegotiation on less favorable terms or inability to enter into new leases on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration, termination or other lapse of our current leases or rights-of-way could cause us to cease operations on the affected land, increase costs related to continuing operations elsewhere and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal, state, and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and the potential for related litigation could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays for our customers, which could cause a decline in the demand for our frac sand and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe supply frac sand to hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and increasingly common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from low permeability hydrocarbon bearing subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, proppants and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock, increase permeability and stimulate production. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing activities. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control Program (\u201cUIC Program\u201d). Currently, with the exception of certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel, hydraulic fracturing is exempt from federal regulation under the UIC Program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state or local governmental authorities. However, the practice of hydraulic fracturing has become controversial and is undergoing increased political and regulatory scrutiny. Several federal agencies, regulatory authorities, and legislative entities are investigating the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and whether additional regulation may be necessary. The U.S. Department of the Interior revised new regulations on May 16, 2013, which would require oil and natural gas operators to disclose the chemicals they use during hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. The proposed regulations would also strengthen standards for wellbore integrity and the management of fluids that return to the surface during and after fracturing operations on federal lands. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency continues to study the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities and in April 2015, proposed regulators for effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing. These activities could limit the use of hydraulic fracturing in the future. From time to time Congress has considered various other legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.\nIn addition, various state, local, and foreign governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. Many local governments also have adopted ordinances to severely restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions.\nThe adoption of new or more stringent laws or regulations at the federal, state, local, or foreign levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells, increase our customers\u2019 costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic oil and gas fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our frac sand. In addition, heightened political, regulatory, and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly, or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our frac sand, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.\nOur operations are exposed to potential natural disasters, including blizzards, tornadoes, storms, floods and earthquakes. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our operations.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business, including the risk of our operations being interrupted due to severe weather and natural disasters. Certain of the insurance policies covering entities that were contributed to us in connection with our formation and our operations also provide coverage to entities that were not contributed to us by our sponsor. The coverage available under those insurance policies has historically been and is currently allocated among the entities that were contributed to us and those entities that were not contributed to us. We reimburse our sponsor for our allocation of premium costs. This allocation may result in limiting the amount of recovery available to us for purposes of covered losses.\nFurthermore, we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and could escalate further. In addition sub-limits have been imposed for certain risks. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to unitholders.\nOur future performance will depend on our ability to succeed in competitive markets, and on our ability to appropriately react to potential fluctuations in the demand for and supply of frac sand.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market that is characterized by a small number of large, national producers and a larger number of small, regional or local producers. Competition in the industry is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution and logistics capabilities, customer service, and reliability of supply and breadth of product offering.\nWe compete with large, national producers such as U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc, Unimin Corporation, Fairmount Minerals, Ltd. and Emerge Energy Services LP. Our larger competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop technology superior to ours or may have production facilities that are located closer to key customers than ours. Should the demand for hydraulic fracturing services decrease, prices in the frac sand market could materially decrease as smaller, regional producers may exit the market, selling frac sand at below market prices. In addition, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and other providers of hydraulic fracturing services could acquire their own frac sand reserves, expand their existing frac sand production capacity or otherwise fulfill their own proppant requirements and existing or new frac sand producers could add to or expand their frac sand production capacity, which may negatively impact pricing and demand for our frac sand. We may not be able to compete successfully against either our larger or smaller competitors in the future, and competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of rail transportation could reduce revenues by causing us to reduce our production or by impairing the ability of our customers to take delivery.\nTransportation costs represent a significant portion of the total delivered cost of frac sand for our customers and, as a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. Disruption of transportation services due to shortages of rail cars, weather-related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply our customers through our logistics network of rail-served origin and distribution terminals, or, if our customers are not using our rail transportation services, the ability of our customers to take delivery and, in certain circumstances, constitute a force majeure event under our customer contracts, permitting our customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for our frac sand. Accordingly, if there are disruptions of the rail transportation services utilized by our customers (whether these services are provided by us or a third party), and they are unable to find alternative transportation providers to transport frac sand, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe face distribution and logistical challenges in our business.\nAs oil and natural gas prices fluctuate, our customers may shift their focus back and forth between different resource plays, some of which can be located in geographic areas that do not have well-developed transportation and distribution infrastructure systems. Transportation and logistical operating expenses comprise a significant portion of our total delivered cost of sales. Therefore, serving our customers in these less-developed areas presents distribution and other operational challenges that may affect our sales and negatively impact our operating costs. Disruptions in transportation services, including shortages of railcars or a lack of developed infrastructure, could affect our ability to timely and cost effectively deliver to our customers and could provide a competitive advantage to competitors located in closer proximity to our customers. Additionally, increases in the price of transportation costs, including freight charges, fuel surcharges, terminal switch fees and demurrage costs, or excess railcars could negatively impact operating costs if we are unable to pass those increased costs along to our customers. Failure to find long-term solutions to these logistical challenges could adversely affect our ability to respond quickly to the needs of our customers or result in additional increased costs, and thus could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur production process consumes large amounts of natural gas and electricity. An increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of these or any other energy sources could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nEnergy costs, primarily natural gas and electricity, represented 2% of our total sales and 11% of our total production costs during the year ended December 31, 2015. Natural gas is the primary fuel source used for drying in the frac sand production process and, as such, our profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas we purchase from third parties. Because we have not contracted for the provision of natural gas on a fixed-price basis, our costs and profitability will be impacted by fluctuations in prices for natural gas. The price and supply of natural gas are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside our control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, actions by OPEC and other oil and natural gas producers, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher production costs for energy, which may be passed on to us in whole or in part. The price of natural gas has been extremely volatile over the last few years, from a high of $8.15 per million British Thermal Units (\u201cBTUs\u201d) in February 2014 to a low of $1.63 per million BTUs in December 2015, and this volatility may continue. In order to manage this risk, we may hedge natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as forwards, swaps and futures. However, these measures carry risk (including nonperformance by counterparties) and do not in any event entirely eliminate the risk of decreased margins as a result of natural gas price increases. A significant increase in the price of energy that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or covered through our hedging arrangements or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas or electricity to our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIncreases in the price of diesel fuel may adversely affect our results of operations.\nDiesel fuel costs and rail fuel surcharges generally fluctuate with increasing and decreasing world crude oil prices, and accordingly are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control. Our operations are dependent on earthmoving equipment, railcars and tractor trailers, and diesel fuel costs are a significant component of the operating expense of these vehicles. We contract with a third party to excavate raw frac sand, deliver the raw frac sand to our processing facility and move the sand from our wet plant to our dry plant, and pay a fixed price per ton of sand delivered to our wet plant, subject to a fuel surcharge based on the price of diesel fuel. Accordingly, increased diesel fuel costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur expansion or modification of existing assets, or the construction of new assets, may not result in revenue increases and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe construction of additions or modifications to our existing facilities and the construction of new facilities generally involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, upon the expenditure of future funds on a particular project, our revenues may not increase immediately, or as anticipated, or at all. For instance, we may construct new terminal facilities over an extended period of time and will not receive any material increases in revenues until the projects are completed. Moreover, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in a location in which such growth does not materialize. Since we are not engaged in the hydraulic fracturing process, we do not possess the expertise to definitively know the extent of drilling and completion activities to take place in future periods. To the extent we rely on estimates of future levels of drilling and completion activity in any decision to construct facilities, such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in forecasting the levels of drilling and completion activity. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the construction of additions to our existing production and terminal assets may require us to increase the size of our railcar fleet to support transportation of additional volumes of production. We may be unable to increase the size of our fleet to capitalize on other expansion or modification opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for us to increase the size of our railcar fleet in-line with additional capacity, which may adversely impact our cash flows.\nWe may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain, develop and increase our asset base. The inability to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nAlthough we have used a significant amount of our cash reserves and cash generated from our operations to fund the development and expansion of our asset base, we may depend on the availability of credit to fund future capital expenditures. Our ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, the covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement, senior secured term loan facility or other future debt agreements, adverse market conditions or other contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our failure to obtain the funds necessary to maintain, develop and increase our asset base could adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nEven if we are able to obtain financing or access the capital markets, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and our level of indebtedness could restrict our ability to fund future development and acquisition activities. In addition, the issuance of additional equity interests may result in significant dilution to our existing unitholders.\nWe have entered into a revolving credit agreement and senior secured term loan facility which contain restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur revolving credit agreement and senior secured term loan facility place financial restrictions and operating restrictions on our business, which may limit our flexibility to respond to opportunities and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit agreement and senior secured term loan facility restrict, and potentially any other future financing agreements that we may enter into could restrict, our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities or to make distributions to our unitholders. For example, our revolving credit agreement contains covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum quarterly EBITDA, allows distributions to unitholders up to 50% of quarterly distributable cash flow after quarterly debt payments on the term loan, and requires that capital expenditures during 2016 not exceed $28 million. Additionally, our revolving credit agreement and senior secured term loan facility restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nenter into a merger, consolidate or acquire capital in or assets of other entities;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens on property;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into sale lease back transactions.\nOur compliance with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures, finance acquisitions, equipment purchases and development expenditures, or withstand a future downturn in our business.\nOur ability to comply with any such restrictions and covenants is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in the revolving credit agreement or senior secured term loan facility, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable and our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, that financing may not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to repay amounts borrowed, the holders of the debt could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding against the collateral. In addition, our obligations under our revolving credit agreement and senior secured term loan facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness as required under these facilities, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have exposure to increases in interest rates under our revolving credit agreement, senior secured term loan facility and other notes payable. As of December 31, 2015, we had $254.4 million of debt outstanding, with an effective interest rate of 4.58%. Assuming no change in the amount outstanding, the impact on interest expense of a 10% increase or decrease in the average interest rate would be approximately $1.2 million per year. As a result of this variable interest rate debt, our financial condition could be adversely affected by increases in interest rates.\nA facility closure or long-term idling entails substantial costs, and if we close our production facilities sooner than anticipated, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of recent market conditions, we elected to temporarily idle our Augusta production facility during October 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we produced and delivered 1.4 million tons out of the Augusta facility.\nWe base our assumptions regarding the life of our production facilities on detailed studies that we perform from time to time, but our studies and assumptions may not prove to be accurate. If we close our production facilities sooner than expected, sales will decline unless we are able to acquire and develop additional facilities, which may not be possible. The closure of a production facility would involve significant fixed closure costs, including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance-related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs and the costs of terminating long-term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. We accrue for the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, non-saleable sand, ponds, roads and other mining support areas over the estimated mining life of our property. If we were to reduce the estimated life of our production facilities, the fixed facility closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase production costs per ton produced and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nApplicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. The plan addresses matters such as removal of facilities and equipment, regrading, prevention of erosion and other forms of water pollution, re-vegetation and post-mining land use. We may be required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance equal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based on permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. If our accruals for expected reclamation and other costs associated with facility closures for which we will be responsible were later determined to be insufficient, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nA shortage of skilled labor together with rising labor costs in the industry may further increase operating costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEfficient sand excavation using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with several years of experience and proficiency in multiple tasks, including processing of mined minerals. Our mining operations are subcontracted to a third party but there is a shortage of skilled mining labor in Wisconsin. If the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens, we may find it difficult to renew or replace that contract upon its expiration on acceptable terms, and we may be unable to hire or train the necessary number of skilled laborers to perform our own operations. In either event, there could be an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand production.\nOur business may suffer if we lose, or are unable to attract and retain, key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel. Members of our senior management and other key employees have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing sand reserves, building new frac sand processing facilities, maximizing production from such properties, marketing frac sand production, transportation, distribution and developing and executing financing strategies, as well as substantial experience and relationships with participants in the oilfield services and exploration and production industries. Competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. The loss of any of these individuals or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less-qualified personnel. In addition, if any of our executives or other key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company, we could lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain highly skilled personnel.\nFailure to maintain effective quality control systems at our mining, processing and production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe performance and quality of our products are critical to the success of our business. These factors depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nSeasonal and severe weather conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions. Severe weather conditions may affect our customers\u2019 operations, thus reducing their need for our products, impact our operations by resulting in weather-related damage to our facilities and equipment and impact our customers\u2019 ability to take delivery of our products at our plant site. Any weather-related interference with our operations could force us to delay or curtail services and potentially breach our contractual obligations to deliver minimum volumes or result in a loss of productivity and an increase in our operating costs.\nIn addition, severe winter weather conditions impact our operations by causing us to halt our excavation and wet plant related production activities during the winter months. During non-winter months, we excavate excess sand to build a washed sand stockpile that feeds the dry plant, which continues to operate during the winter months. Unexpected winter conditions (e.g., if winter conditions comes earlier than expected or last longer than expected) may result in us not having a sufficient sand stockpile to supply feedstock for our dry plant during winter months, which could result in us being unable to meet our contracted sand deliveries during such time and lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation.\nOur cash flow fluctuates on a seasonal basis.\nOur cash flow is affected by a variety of factors, including weather conditions and seasonal periods. Seasonal fluctuations in weather impact the production levels at our wet processing plant. While our sales and finished product production levels are contracted evenly throughout the year, our mining and wet sand processing activities are limited to non-winter months. In addition, while the wet processing plant is not operating, we will perform annual maintenance activities, the majority of which are expensed. As a consequence, we may experience lower cash costs and higher expense in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year.\nDiminished access to water may adversely affect our operations.\nThe excavation and processing activities in which we engage require significant amounts of water, of which we recycle a significant percentage in our operating process. As a result, securing water rights and water access is necessary for the operation of our processing facilities. If future excavation and processing activities are located in an area that is water-constrained, there may be additional costs associated with securing water access. We have obtained water rights that we currently use to service the activities on our property, and we plan to obtain all required water rights to service other properties we may develop or acquire in the future. However, the amount of water that we are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulatory authorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or eliminate our current water rights, and we may be unable to retain all or a portion of such water rights. These new regulations, which could also affect local municipalities and other industrial operations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs if implemented. Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights may alter the environment in which we do business, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, a water discharge permit may be required to properly dispose of water at our processing sites. The water discharge permitting process is also subject to regulatory discretion, and any inability to obtain the necessary permits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nContinued downturn in business could result in potential impairment of goodwill or other intangibles.\nDuring 2015, global oil and natural gas commodity prices, particularly crude oil, significantly decreased as compared to 2014. This decrease in commodity prices has had, and is expected to continue to have, a negative impact on industry drilling and well completion activity, which affects the demand for frac sand. Should energy industry conditions further deteriorate, there is a possibility that goodwill or other intangibles may be impaired in a future period. Any resulting non-cash impairment charges to earnings may be material. Specific uncertainties affecting our estimated fair value include the impact of competition, the prices of frac sand, future overall activity levels and demand for frac sand, the activity levels of our significant customers, and other factors affecting the rate of our future growth. These factors will continue to be reviewed and assessed going forward. Additional adverse developments with regard to these factors could have a further negative impact on our fair value.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States could adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing plants or refineries are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our frac sand. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Mining and Other Regulation\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulatory environmental requirements affecting the mining and mineral processing industry, including among others, those relating to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air and water emissions, water pollution, waste management, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use, reclamation and restoration of properties, hazardous materials, and natural resources. These laws, regulations, and permits have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for noncompliance, and others, such as CERCLA, may impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances. Liability under CERCLA, or similar state and local laws, may be imposed as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Failure to properly handle, transport, store, or dispose of hazardous materials or otherwise conduct our operations in compliance with environmental laws could expose us to liability for governmental penalties, cleanup costs, and civil or criminal liability associated with releases of such materials into the environment, damages to property, or natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our mineral deposits or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Future events, including changes in any environmental requirements (or their interpretation or enforcement) and the costs associated with complying with such requirements, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nissuance of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ndenial, modification, or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u2022\nimposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on our operations, including cessation of operations; and\n\u2022\nrequirements to perform site investigatory, remedial, or other corrective actions.\nAny such regulations could require us to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations, increase significantly our operating costs, or impose additional operating restrictions among our customers that reduce demand for our services.\nWe may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations that are adopted, and any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify our operations or equipment or shut down our facilities. Additionally, our customers may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations, which could cause our customers to curtail or cease operations. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate our costs of compliance or the timing of any costs associated with any new laws and regulations, or any material adverse effect that any new standards will have on our customers and, consequently, on our operations.\nSilica-related legislation, health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration, may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. We may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations that are adopted, and any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify or cease our operations.\nIn addition, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is recent evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the frac sand industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of frac sand, may have the effect of discouraging our customers\u2019 use of our frac sand. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling frac sand could materially and adversely affect frac sand producers, including us, through reduced use of frac sand, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers or reduced financing sources available to the frac sand industry.\nWe are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations.\nOur operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment, and other matters. Our failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to other extensive regulations, including licensing, plant and wildlife protection and reclamation regulation, that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to the regulatory matters described above, we and our customers are subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration activities at mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining and hydraulic fracturing have on groundwater quality and availability. Our future success depends, among other things, on the quantity and quality of our frac sand deposits, our ability to extract these deposits profitably, and our customers being able to operate their businesses as they currently do.\nIn order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future, we may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed excavation or production activities, individually or in the aggregate, may have on the environment. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies, and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site. Finally, obtaining or renewing required permits is sometimes delayed or prevented due to community opposition and other factors beyond our control. The denial of a permit essential to our operations or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop or expand a site. Significant opposition to a permit by neighboring property owners, members of the public, or other third parties, or delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could delay or impair our ability to develop or expand a site. New legal requirements, including those related to the protection of the environment, could be adopted that could materially adversely affect our mining operations (including our ability to extract or the pace of extraction of mineral deposits), our cost structure, or our customers\u2019 ability to use our frac sand. Such current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and we may not be able to obtain or renew permits in the future.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally obligated to restore property in accordance with regulatory standards and our approved reclamation plan after it has been mined. We are required under federal, state, and local laws to maintain financial assurances, such as surety bonds, to secure such obligations. The inability to acquire, maintain or renew such assurances, as required by federal, state, and local laws, could subject us to fines and penalties as well as the revocation of our operating permits. Such inability could result from a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe lack of availability, higher expense, or unreasonable terms of such financial assurances;\n\u2022\nthe ability of current and future financial assurance counterparties to increase required collateral; and\n\u2022\nthe exercise by financial assurance counterparties of any rights to refuse to renew the financial assurance instruments.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain, or renew necessary financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Structure\nOur sponsor owns and controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our general partner and its affiliates, including our sponsor, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders.\nOur sponsor, Hi-Crush Proppants LLC, owns and controls our general partner and appoints all of the directors of our general partner. Although our general partner has a duty to manage us in a manner it believes to be in our best interests, the executive officers and directors of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to our sponsor. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between our sponsor or any of its affiliates, including our general partner, on the one hand, and us or any of our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:\n\u2022\nour general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as our sponsor, in exercising certain rights under our partnership agreement, which has the effect of limiting its duty to our unitholders;\n\u2022\nneither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires our sponsor to pursue a business strategy that favors us;\n\u2022\nour partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limits our general partner\u2019s liabilities and restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without such limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022\nexcept in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;\n\u2022\nour general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditure and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. This determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;\n\u2022\nour general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and the level of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;\n\u2022\nour general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions to our common unitholders, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make incentive distributions;\n\u2022\nour partnership agreement permits us to distribute up to $26 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, non-working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund the incentive distribution rights;\n\u2022\nour general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us;\n\u2022\nour partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with its affiliates on our behalf;\n\u2022\nour general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;\n\u2022\nour general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units;\n\u2022\nour general partner controls the enforcement of obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us;\n\u2022\nour general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or other advisors to perform services for us; and\n\u2022\nour sponsor may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our sponsor\u2019s incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner or the unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to the common unitholders in certain situations.\nIn addition, we may compete directly with entities in which our sponsor has an interest for acquisition opportunities and potentially will compete with these entities for new and existing customers. In particular, our sponsor\u2019s Whitehall and Blair facilities could compete with us for new and existing frac sand customers.\nThe board of directors of our general partner may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion. Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all.\nThe board of directors of our general partner has adopted a cash distribution policy pursuant to which we intend to distribute quarterly on all of our units to the extent we have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of our expenses, including payments to our general partner and its affiliates. However, the board may change such policy at any time at its discretion.\nIn addition, our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the permanence of such a policy in making an investment decision. Any modification or revocation of our cash distribution policy could substantially reduce or eliminate the amounts of distributions to our unitholders. The amount of distributions we make, if any, and the decision to make any distribution at all will be determined by the board of directors of our general partner, whose interests may differ from those of our common unitholders. Our general partner has limited duties to our unitholders, which may permit it to favor its own interests or the interests of our sponsor to the detriment of our common unitholders.\nOn October 26, 2015, our general partner's board of directors announced the temporary suspension of our quarterly distribution to common unitholders in order to conserve cash and preserve liquidity.\nOur general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations.\nOur general partner intends to limit its liability under contractual arrangements between us and third parties so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our general partner or its assets. Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner\u2019s duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.\nOur sponsor competes with us, and other affiliates of our general partner have the ability to compete with us.\nAffiliates of our general partner, including our sponsor, are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us. Our sponsor has investments in entities that acquire, own and operate frac sand excavation and processing facilities and may make additional investments in the future. These investments and acquisitions may include entities or assets that we would have been interested in acquiring. Therefore, our sponsor may compete with us for investment opportunities. In addition, our sponsor owns the Whitehall and Blair facilities through entities that could compete with us and we expect that it will acquire interests in additional entities that may compete with us. We share our management team with our sponsor, and despite our sponsor\u2019s and management team\u2019s meaningful economic interest in us, the shared management team is under no obligation to offer new and amended customer contracts to us before offering them to our sponsor, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to renew or replace existing customer contracts on favorable terms or at all.\nPursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our general partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors and our sponsor. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual or potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our general partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders.\nIt is our policy to distribute a significant portion of our cash available for distribution to our partners, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.\nWe plan to distribute most of our cash available for distribution, which may cause our growth to proceed at a slower pace than that of businesses that reinvest their cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the cash that we have available to distribute to our unitholders. Our revolving credit agreement allows distributions to unitholders up to 50% of quarterly distributable cash flow after quarterly debt payments on the term loan.\nOur partnership agreement replaces our general partner\u2019s fiduciary duties to holders of our units.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate and replace the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our general partner may make in its individual capacity include:\n\u2022\nhow to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;\n\u2022\nwhether to exercise its call right;\n\u2022\nhow to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;\n\u2022\nwhether to exercise its registration rights;\n\u2022\nwhether to elect to reset target distribution levels; and\n\u2022\nwhether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement.\nBy purchasing a common unit, a unitholder is treated as having consented to the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.\nOur partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our units for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that:\n\u2022\nwhenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;\n\u2022\nour general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning that it believed that the decision was in the best interest of our partnership;\n\u2022\nour general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal; and\n\u2022\nour general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:\n(1)\napproved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval; or\n(2)\napproved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates.\nIn connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by our general partner must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors of our general partner acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.\nOur sponsor may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to its incentive distribution rights, without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner or the holders of our common units. This could result in lower distributions to holders of our common units.\nOur sponsor has the right, as the initial holder of our incentive distribution rights, at any time when it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled (50.0%) for the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our distributions at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election by our sponsor, the minimum quarterly distribution will be adjusted to equal the reset minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution.\nIf our sponsor elects to reset the target distribution levels, it will be entitled to receive a number of common units. The number of common units to be issued to our sponsor will equal the number of common units that would have entitled the holder to an aggregate quarterly cash distribution in the quarter prior to the reset election equal to the distribution to our sponsor on the incentive distribution rights in the quarter prior to the reset election. We anticipate that our sponsor would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion. It is possible, however, that our sponsor could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or expects to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may, therefore, desire to be issued common units rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. This risk could be elevated if our incentive distribution rights have been transferred to a third party. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience a reduction in the amount of cash distributions that our common unitholders would have otherwise received had we not issued new common units to our sponsor in connection with resetting the target distribution levels.\nHolders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors, which could reduce the price at which our common units will trade.\nUnlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management\u2019s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our general partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our general partner, including the independent directors, is chosen entirely by our sponsor, as a result of it owning our general partner, and not by our unitholders. Unlike publicly-traded corporations, we do not conduct annual meetings of our unitholders to elect directors or conduct other matters routinely conducted at annual meetings of stockholders of corporations. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.\nEven if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they cannot remove our general partner without its consent.\nIf our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have limited ability to remove our general partner. Unitholders are currently unable to remove our general partner without its consent because our general partner and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding units voting together as a single class is required to remove our general partner. As of December 31, 2015, our sponsor owned 36.9% of our common units.\nOur general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.\nOur general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the members of our general partner to transfer their respective membership interests in our general partner to a third party. The new members of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner with their own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions taken by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner. This effectively permits a \u201cchange of control\u201d without the vote or consent of the unitholders.\nThe incentive distribution rights held by our sponsor may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.\nOur sponsor may transfer the incentive distribution rights to a third party at any time without the consent of our unitholders. If our sponsor transfers the incentive distribution rights to a third party but retains its ownership interest in our general partner, our general partner may not have the same incentive to grow our partnership and increase quarterly distributions to unitholders over time as it would if our sponsor had retained ownership of the incentive distribution rights. For example, a transfer of incentive distribution rights by our sponsor could reduce the likelihood of our sponsor accepting offers made by us relating to assets owned by it, as it would have less of an economic incentive to grow our business, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our asset base.\nOur general partner has a call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.\nIf at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price equal to the greater of (1) the average of the daily closing price of the common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three days before notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (2) the highest per-unit price paid by our general partner or any of its affiliates for common units during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our general partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the limited call right. There is no restriction in our partnership agreement that prevents our general partner from issuing additional common units and exercising its call right. If our general partner exercised its limited call right, the effect would be to take us private and, if the units were subsequently deregistered, we would no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2015, our sponsor owned 36.9% of our common units.\nWe may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.\nOur partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022\nour existing unitholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;\n\u2022\nbecause a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase;\n\u2022\nthe ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of the common units may decline.\nThere are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue units ranking senior to the common units.\nIn accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may issue additional partnership interests that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation and voting. The issuance by us of units of senior rank may (i) reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders; (ii) diminish the relative voting strength of the total common units outstanding as a class; or (iii) subordinate the claims of the common unitholders to our assets in the event of our liquidation.\nOur partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.\nOur partnership agreement restricts unitholders\u2019 voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter.\nCost reimbursements due to our general partner and its affiliates for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our general partner.\nPrior to making any distribution on the common units, we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. Our partnership agreement does not set a limit on the amount of expenses for which our general partner and its affiliates may be reimbursed. These expenses include salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform services for us or on our behalf and expenses allocated to our general partner by its affiliates. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us. The reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees, if any, to our general partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nYour liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.\nA general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some jurisdictions. You could be liable for our obligations as if you were a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that:\n\u2022\nwe were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state\u2019s partnership statute; or\n\u2022\nyour right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace the general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute \u201ccontrol\u201d of our business.\nUnitholders may have liability to repay distributions and in certain circumstances may be personally liable for the obligations of the partnership.\nUnder certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, or the Delaware Act, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our units.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our units.\nThe New York Stock Exchange does not require a publicly-traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.\nOur common units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cHCLP.\u201d Because we are a publicly-traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our general partner\u2019s board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nTax Risks to Common Unitholders\nOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to material additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to you could be substantially reduced.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nDespite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Although we do not believe, based upon our current operations, that we will be so treated, a change in our business (or a change in current law) could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.\nIf we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to the unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.\nOur partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.\nThe tax treatment of publicly-traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nThe present federal income tax treatment of publicly-traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, members of the U.S. Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships.\nA publicly traded partnership is treated as a corporation unless 90% or more of its income meets the definition of qualifying income as defined by Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. On May 5, 2015, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations providing industry specific guidance with respect to activities which will generate qualifying income. We do not believe the proposed regulations affect our ability to qualify as a publicly traded partnership. However, once the final regulations are issued, we may need to modify the activities that we can treat as qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income requirement.\nAny modification to the federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. In addition, such changes may affect or cause us to change our business activities, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us, change the character or treatment of portions of its income, or otherwise adversely affect an investment in our common units. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units and the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nOur unitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.\nBecause our unitholders are treated as partners to whom we allocate taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, they are required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income whether or not they receive cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income.\nOn October 26, 2015, our general partner's board of directors announced the temporary suspension of our quarterly distribution to common unitholders in order to conserve cash and preserve liquidity.\nThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nWe will be considered to have terminated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than the calendar year, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but instead, after our termination we would be treated as a new partnership for federal income tax purposes. If treated as a new partnership, we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred.\nTax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.\nIf our unitholders sell their common units, they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of their allocable share of our net taxable income result in a decrease in their tax basis in their common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units they sell will, in effect, become taxable income to them if they sell such units at a price greater than their tax basis in those units, even if the price they receive is less than their original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture of depreciation and depletion deductions and certain other items. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder\u2019s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if they sell their units, they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale.\nTax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nInvestments in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (or \u201cIRAs\u201d), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, is unrelated business taxable income and is taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons are reduced by withholding taxes, and non-U.S. persons are required to file federal tax returns and pay tax on their shares of our taxable income.\nIf the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nThe IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest by the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. Our costs of any contest by the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.\nWe treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.\nBecause we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and in order to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our common units, we have adopted certain depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. These positions may result in an overstatement of deductions and losses and an understatement of income and gain to our unitholders. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders\u2019 tax returns.\nWe prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nWe generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. Nonetheless, we allocate certain deductions for depreciation of capital additions based upon the date the underlying property is placed in service. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing or proposed Treasury Regulations. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our proration method, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among our unitholders.\nA unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a \u201cshort seller\u201d to cover a short sale of common units) may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, such unitholder would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.\nBecause there is no tax concept of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, such unitholder may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units.\nOur unitholders are subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units.\nIn addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders are subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2015, we own assets and conduct business in several states. Most of these states currently impose a personal income tax and income taxes on corporations and other entities. Unitholders may be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in these states. Further, unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own assets or conduct business in additional states or foreign jurisdictions that impose a personal income tax. It is our unitholders' responsibility to file all U.S. federal, foreign, state and local tax returns.", "PERMNO": 13544, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "HCRSQ"}
