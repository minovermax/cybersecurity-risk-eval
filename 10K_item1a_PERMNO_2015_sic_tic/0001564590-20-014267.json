RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be harmed, and has been harmed, by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our securities could decline, and has declined, due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nActual or Threatened Epidemics or Pandemics may Have an Adverse Effect on our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to constitute a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.\u201d On January 30, 2020, the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 4 \u201cdo not travel\u201d advisory for China. The U.S. government has also implemented enhanced screenings, quarantine requirements and travel restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak. On March 8, 2020 the U.S. Department of State issued a warning for US citizens to not travel by cruise ship. COVID-19 has resulted in the temporary ceasing of our operations of health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and at destination resorts, and cruise ship itinerary modifications in response to travel restrictions and advisories, which has significantly impacted our business and revenue. Risks related to an epidemic or pandemic, such as COVID-19, could also lead to the prolonged closure of our health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and at destination resorts. COVID-19 is also impacting consumer sentiment regarding travel generally. The situation surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak is fluid, and the duration and magnitude of its impacts on our financial condition and results of operations are difficult to reasonably estimate at this time. COVID-19, and similar outbreaks in the future, or threats of such outbreaks, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe Depend on Our Agreements with Cruise Lines and Destination Resort Health and Wellness Centers; if These Agreements Terminate, Our Business Would Be Harmed\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated from our cruise ship health and wellness operations. The cruise line agreements have specific terms, ranging from 2 to 10.7 years with an average remaining term per ship of approximately 3.4 years as of December 31, 2019. As of that date, cruise line agreements that expire within one year covered 14 of the 170 ships served by us. These 14 ships accounted for approximately 8% of our 2019 revenues. These agreements, as well as our other cruise line agreements, may not be renewed after their expiration date on similar terms or at all. Any renewals may cause reductions in our margins. From time to time, the amounts we pay to cruise lines and land-based venues increase upon entering into renewals of agreements.\nIn addition, these agreements provide for termination by the cruise lines with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances, including, among other things, the withdrawal of a ship from the cruise trade, the sale or lease of a ship or our failure to achieve specified passenger service standards. As of December 31, 2019, agreements for four ships provided for termination for any reason by the cruise line on 90 days\u2019 notice, and with respect to four of our ships, we are operating without written agreements. These four ships (which are included in the 170 ships referenced above) accounted for 5.0% of our 2019 revenues. Termination of significant cruise line agreements or a series of other cruise line agreements, either upon completion of their terms or prior thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Some of our land-based health and wellness center agreements also provide for termination with limited advance notice under certain circumstances.\nAs a result of the consolidation of the cruise industry, the number of independent cruise lines has decreased in recent years, and this trend may continue. Also, historically, some smaller cruise lines have ceased operating for economic reasons and this may happen to other cruise lines in the future. As a result of these factors, a small number of cruise companies, all of which currently are our customers, dominate the cruise industry. Revenues from passengers of each of the following cruise line companies accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively: Carnival (including Carnival, Carnival Australia, Costa, Holland America, P&O, Princess, and Seabourn cruise lines): 46.7%, 48.5%, and 48.6%, Royal Caribbean (including Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur, Azamara and Silversea cruise lines): 23.1%, 21.0%, and 20.8%, and Norwegian Cruise Line (including Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises): 14.7%, 13.8%, and 13.0%. These companies, combined, accounted for 152 of the 170 ships served by OneSpaWorld as of December 31, 2019. If we cease to serve one of these cruise companies, or a substantial number of ships operated by a cruise company, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Depend on the Cruise Industry and Their Risks Are Risks to Us\nCruise lines compete for consumer disposable leisure time dollars with other vacation alternatives, such as hotels and sightseeing vacations. Demand for cruises is dependent on the underlying economic strength of the countries from which cruise lines source their passengers. Economic changes that reduce disposable income or consumer confidence in the countries from which our cruise line partners source their passengers may affect demand for vacations, including cruise vacations, which are discretionary purchases.\nDespite the general historic trend of growth in the volume of cruise passengers, in 2020 and future years, the global economic environment, including the impacts related to the recent coronavirus outbreak, may cause the number of cruise passengers to decline or be maintained through discounting, which could result in an increased number of passengers with limited discretionary spending ability. A significant decrease in passenger volume could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA continuing industry trend reported by CLIA is the growing number of passengers sourced from outside North America. We believe that non-North American passengers spend less on our services and products than North American passengers. Other recent trends are those of certain cruise lines reducing the number of cruises to certain long-standing destinations and replacing them with alternative exotic destinations, as well as extending the length of voyages. A number of such replacements and extensions result in cruises producing lower revenues to us than cruises to the prior destinations and of certain long-standing durations. The continuation of these trends could materially adversely affect the results of our shipboard health and wellness operations.\nA significant portion of the cruise industry\u2019s growth is expected to come from expansion of markets outside of our core North American market. Our facilities on North American ships are our best performing facilities, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate the same revenue performance in non-North American markets. Additionally, our cruise partners dictate the itineraries and geographies where their ships sail, and they may change itineraries to be less favorable to our revenue performance.\nAccidents and other incidents involving cruise ships can materially adversely affect the cruise industry, as well as our results of operations and financial condition. Among other things, accidents reduce our revenues and increase the costs of our maritime-related insurance. In addition, accidents can adversely affect consumer demand for cruise vacations.\nOther unscheduled withdrawals of ships from service, delays in new ship introductions, environmental violations by cruise lines, restricted access of cruise ships to environmentally sensitive regions, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions and increases in fuel costs could also materially adversely impact the cruise industry. For example, in the past, hurricanes have caused the withdrawal of ships that we served from service for use in hurricane relief efforts, as well as the temporary closing of cruise ports and the destruction of a cruise pier facility. A number of cruise ships have experienced outbreaks of illnesses that have affected, at times, hundreds of passengers on a ship. In addition, epidemics affecting global regions, or a pandemic such as the coronavirus, could also adversely affect cruise ship travel. Also, in recent years, plane crashes, violence and other crimes, passenger accidents, disappearances and assaults, fatalities from shore excursion activities, shipboard fires and other incidents have brought adverse publicity to the travel industry, including the cruise industry. The public concern over these incidents, especially if they are repeated, or other negative publicity about the cruise industry, could adversely affect the demand for cruises and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The cruise lines\u2019 capacity has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow over the next few years as new ships are introduced. In order to utilize the new capacity, it is likely that the cruise industry will need to increase its share of the overall vacation market. In order to increase that market share, cruise lines may be required to offer discounted fares to prospective passengers, which would have the potentially adverse effects on us described above.\nSevere weather conditions, both at sea and at ports of embarkation, also could adversely affect the cruise industry. The cruise industry also relies to a significant extent on airlines to transport passengers to ports of embarkation. Changes in airline service to cruise embarkation and disembarkation locations could adversely affect us. In addition, any strikes or other disruptions of airline service, including those that could follow terrorist attacks or armed hostilities, could adversely affect the ability of cruise passengers or our shipboard staff to reach their ports of embarkation, or could cause cancellation of cruises.\nCruise ships have increasingly had itineraries which provide for the ships to be in port during cruises. When cruise ships are in port, our revenues are adversely affected.\nCruise ships periodically go into dry-dock for routine maintenance, repairs and refurbishment for periods ranging from one to three weeks. Cruise ships also may be taken out of service unexpectedly for non-routine maintenance and repairs as a result of damage from an accident or otherwise, such as the Carnival Triumph, Oasis of the Seas, and Costa Smerelda incidents. A ship also may go out of service with respect to us if it is transferred to a cruise line we do not serve or if it is retired from service. While we attempt to plan appropriately for the scheduled removal from service of ships we serve, unexpected removals from service of ships we serve can hamper the efficient distribution of our shipboard personnel, in addition to causing unexpected reductions in our shipboard revenues.\nWe Are Required to Make Minimum Payments under Our Agreements and May Face Increasing Payments to Cruise Lines and Owners of Our Destination Resort Health and Wellness Centers\nWe are obligated to make minimum annual payments to certain cruise lines and owners of our land-based venues regardless of the amount of revenues we receive from customers. We may also be required to make such minimum annual payments under any future agreements into which we enter. Accordingly, we could be obligated to pay more in minimum payments than the amount we collect from customers. As of December 31, 2019, these payments are required by cruise line agreements covering a total of 151 ships served by us and by six of the agreements for our destination resort health and wellness centers.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we guaranteed total minimum payments to cruise lines (excluding payments based on minimum amounts per passenger per day of a cruise applicable to certain ships served by us) and owners of our land-based venues of approximately $126 million in the aggregate in 2020, which amount does not take into account cancelled voyages. As we renew or enter into new agreements with cruise lines and land-based venues, we may experience increases in such required payments and such increases may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Depend on the Continued Viability of the Ships and Destination Resort Health and Wellness Centers We Serve\nOur revenues from our shipboard guests and guests at our destination resort health and wellness centers can only be generated if the ships and land-based venues we serve are open for business and continue to operate. Historically, some smaller cruise lines we served have ceased operating for economic reasons. We cannot be assured of the continued viability of any of the land-based venues (including our ability to protect our investments in build-outs of health and wellness centers) or cruise lines that we serve, particularly in the event of recurrence of the more severe aspects of the economic slowdown experienced in certain prior years, which may occur due to the recent coronavirus outbreak. To the extent that cruise lines or land-based venues we serve, or could potentially serve in the future, cease to operate, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIncreased Costs Could Adversely Impact our Financial Results\nIn addition to the adverse effects on the cruise industry of high fuel costs described above, periods of higher fuel costs adversely affect us directly. We depend on commercial airlines for the transportation of our shipboard employees to and from the ships we serve and, as a result, we pay for a relatively large number of flights for these employees each year. During times of higher fuel costs, such as those experienced in certain prior years, airfares, including those applicable to the transportation of our employees, have been increased by the airlines we have utilized. Increased transportation costs associated with increased fuel costs also add to the costs of delivery of our products to the ships we serve and other destinations. Higher fuel charges also increase the cost to consumers of transportation to cruise ship destination ports and to venues where we operate our destination resort health and wellness centers and also increase the cost of utilities at our destination resort health and wellness centers. Periods of increasing fuel costs would likely cause these transportation costs to correspondingly increase. Extended periods of increased airfares could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in prices of other commodities utilized by us in our business could adversely affect us. For example, in certain prior years, as a result of increases in the cost of cotton, the cost to us of linens and uniforms utilized in our operations has increased. Our land-based health and wellness operations also have experienced an increase in the cost of electrical utilities. A continuing increase in these costs or similar costs applicable to our operations could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in minimum wage obligations in jurisdictions where we employ personnel have also affected us directly and could adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition.\nWe Depend on Our Key Officers and Qualified Employees\nOur continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior executive officers, including Leonard Fluxman, our Executive Chairman, Glenn Fusfield, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Stephen Lazarus, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. The loss of the services of any of these persons or other key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our continued success also is dependent on our ability to recruit and retain personnel qualified to perform our services. Shipboard employees typically are employed pursuant to agreements with terms of nine months. Our land-based health and wellness employees generally are employed without contracts, on an at-will basis. Other providers of shipboard health and wellness services compete with us for shipboard personnel. We also compete with destination resort health and wellness centers and other employers for our shipboard and land-based health and wellness personnel. We may not be able to continue to attract a sufficient number of applicants possessing the requisite training and skills necessary to conduct our business. Our inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified applicants to provide our services and products could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in recent years, the immigration approval process in the United States has proceeded at a slower pace than previously had been the case. Since many of our shipboard employees are not United States citizens, exacerbation of this trend could adversely affect our ability to meet our shipboard staffing needs on a timely basis.\nAlmost all of our shipboard personnel come from jurisdictions outside the United States. Our ability to obtain non-United States shipboard employees is subject to regulations in certain countries from which we source a number of our employees and, in the case of one country, control by an employment company that acts on behalf of employees and potential employees from that country. In addition, in that country, we are required to deal with local employment companies to facilitate the hiring of employees. Our ability to obtain shipboard employees from those countries on economic terms that are acceptable to us may be hampered by evolving regulatory requirements and/or our inability to enter into an acceptable agreement with the applicable local employment company.\nIn addition, the various jurisdictions where we operate our health and wellness centers have their own licensing or similar requirements applicable to our employees, which could affect our ability to open new health and wellness centers on a timely basis or adequately staff existing health and wellness centers. The ship we serve that is United States-based also is subject to United States labor law requirements that can result in delays in obtaining adequate staffing.\nPossible Adverse Changes in United States or Foreign Tax Laws or Changes in Our Business Could Increase Our Taxes\nBackground\nWe are a Bahamas international business company (\u201cIBC\u201d) that owns, among other entities, OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) Limited (formerly known as Steiner Transocean Limited) (\u201cOneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u201d), our principal subsidiary and a Bahamas IBC that conducts our shipboard operations, primarily outside United States waters (which constitutes most of our shipboard activities), and One Spa World LLC, a Florida limited liability company that performs administrative services in connection with our operations in exchange for fees from OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) and other subsidiaries.\nWe also own, directly or indirectly, the shares of additional subsidiaries organized in the United States, the United Kingdom and other taxable jurisdictions, as well as subsidiaries organized in jurisdictions that do not subject the subsidiaries to taxation.\nCurrently, we and our non-United States subsidiaries are not subject to Bahamas income tax or other (including United States federal) income tax, except as set forth below. Our United States subsidiaries are subject to United States federal income tax as a consolidated group at regular corporate rates up to 21%. Generally, any dividends paid by our United States holding company to its parent, are subject to a 30% United States withholding tax. Other than as described below, we believe that none of the income generated by our non-United States subsidiaries should be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and, accordingly, that such income should not be subject to United States federal income tax.\nA foreign corporation generally is subject to United States federal corporate income tax at a rate of up to 21% on its United States-source income that is effectively connected with its trade or business within the United States and on certain limited types of its foreign-source income that is effectively connected to a trade or business it conducts in the United States. A foreign corporation also can be subject to a branch profits tax of 30% imposed on its after-tax earnings that are so effectively connected.\nOneSpaWorld (Bahamas) has three types of income: income from the provision of health and wellness services, income from the sales of health and wellness products and income from leasing (at rates determined on an arm\u2019s length basis) our shipboard employees and space to a United States subsidiary that performs health and wellness services and sells health and wellness products while the ships are in United States waters and pays OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) the amounts referenced above (the \u201cU.S. Waters Activities\u201d).\nWe believe that most of OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s shipboard income should be treated as foreign-source income not effectively connected to a business it conducts in the United States. This belief is based on the following:\n\u2022\nall of the functions performed, resources employed and risks assumed in connection with the performance of the above-mentioned services and sales (other than OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s involvement in the U.S. Waters Activities) occur outside of the United States; and\n\u2022\nincome to OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) from the U.S. Waters Activities is income effectively connected with a United States trade or business, and thus subject to United States income taxation, but constitutes a small percentage of OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s total income.\nThe Risks to OneSpaWorld\nUnder United States Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) regulations, as of January 1, 2007, all or a portion of OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s income for periods commencing on or after that date could be subject to United States federal income tax at a rate of up to 35% with respect to income earned prior to January 1, 2018 and up to 21% with respect to income earned thereafter:\n\u2022\nto the extent the income from OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s shipboard operations that OneSpaWorld believes are performed outside of United States territorial waters is considered by the IRS to be attributable to functions performed, resources employed or risks assumed within the United States or its possessions or territorial waters;\n\u2022\nto the extent the income from OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s sale of health and wellness products for use, consumption, or disposition in international waters is considered by the IRS to be attributable to functions performed, resources employed or risks assumed within the United States, its possessions or territorial waters; or\n\u2022\nto the extent that passage of title or transfer of ownership of products sold by OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) for use, consumption or disposition outside international waters, takes place in the United States or a United States office materially participates in such sales.\nIf OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) is considered to be a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d), any of its shipboard income would be considered income from sources within the United States and would be subject to United States federal income tax unless such income is attributable to functions performed, resources employed or risks assumed in a foreign country or countries.\nA foreign corporation is a CFC if more than 50% of (i) the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or (ii) the total value of the stock of such corporation is owned or considered as owned by \u201cUnited States shareholders\u201d (\u201cU.S. shareholders\u201d) on any day during the taxable year of such corporation. A \u201cU.S. Shareholder,\u201d generally, means a \u201cUnited States person\u201d (\u201cU.S. person\u201d) who owns directly, indirectly or constructively at least 10% of the voting power or value of the stock of a foreign corporation. A \u201cU.S. person\u201d is a citizen or resident of the United States, a domestic partnership, a domestic corporation, any domestic estate or a trust over which a United States court is able to exercise administrative supervision and over which one or more United States persons have authority to control all substantial decisions.\nUnder certain \u201cdownward attribution\u201d rules, made applicable by a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) to determine the CFC status of a foreign corporate subsidiary of a foreign parent corporation that also has a U.S. subsidiary, the foreign subsidiary may in certain circumstances be treated as a CFC based solely on its brother-sister relationship to the U.S. subsidiary. However, in 2018 the IRS and Treasury Department announced that pending the issuance of further guidance, and solely for purposes of the income-source rules described above, taxpayers may determine whether a foreign corporation is a CFC without regard to this provision of the TCJA. In 2019, the IRS and Treasury Department issued a proposed regulation which is consistent with the 2018 announcement, and proposed that a taxpayer may apply the regulation to the last tax year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018 and each subsequent year.\nAccordingly, solely for purposes of the income-sourcing rules described above, we believe that OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) should not be characterized as a CFC. This should allow us to treat most of our shipboard income, which is earned by a foreign corporation that would not be a CFC but for the TCJA provision referred to above, to be foreign source income to the same extent as income earned by a non-CFC.\nIf OneSpaWorld (Bahamas) is subject to United States federal income tax (at a rate of up to 21%) on its United States-source income and on certain of its foreign-source income that is effectively connected to a business it conducts in the United States, it also would be subject to a branch profits tax of 30% imposed on its after-tax earnings withdrawn, or considered to be withdrawn, from its United States business.\nCertain non-United States jurisdictions may also assert that OneSpaWorld (Bahamas)\u2019s income is subject to their income tax.\nSome of our United Kingdom, Bahamas and United States subsidiaries provide goods and/or services to us and certain of our other subsidiaries. The United Kingdom or United States tax authorities may assert that some or all of these transactions do not contain arm\u2019s length terms. In that event, income or deductions could be reallocated among our subsidiaries in a manner that could increase the United Kingdom or United States tax on us. This reallocation also could result in the imposition of interest and penalties.\nWe cannot assure you that the tax laws on which we have relied to minimize our income taxes will remain unchanged in the future.\nOur land-based operations, the income from which is generally taxable, have significantly increased and we intend to consider land-based opportunities in the future (though we cannot assure you that we will be successful in finding appropriate opportunities). To the extent that we are able to effectively implement this strategy, the amount of our income that is subject to tax would increase.\nThe Success of Health and Wellness Centers Depends on the Hospitality Industry\nWe are dependent on the hospitality industry for the success of destination resort centers. To the extent that consumers do not choose to stay at venues where we operate health and wellness centers, over which we have no control, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The hospitality industry is subject to risks that are similar to those of the cruise industry. As discussed above, the recent coronavirus outbreak has caused government travel advisories, itinerary modifications and/or travel cancellations that are impacting demand at hotels and resorts, resulting in material adverse effects to the hospitality industry.\nThe considerations described above regarding the effects of adverse economic conditions on the cruise industry apply similarly to the hospitality industry, including the resorts where we have operations. Periods of economic slowdown result in reduced destination resort occupancy rates and decreased spending by destination resort guests, including at the resorts where we operate health and wellness centers. The recurrence of challenging economic conditions, as well as instances of increased fuel costs, which have occurred in certain prior years, could result in lower resort occupancy, which would have a direct, adverse effect on the number of resort guests that purchase our health and wellness services and products at the venues in question. Accordingly, such lower occupancy rates at the resorts we serve could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe following are other risks related to the hospitality industry:\n\u2022\nchanges in the national, regional and local conditions (including major national or international terrorist attacks, armed hostilities or other significant adverse events, including an oversupply of hotel properties or a reduction in demand for hotel rooms);\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of funds expended for build-outs of health and wellness centers at venues that fail to open, underperform or close due to economic slowdowns or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe attractiveness of the venues to consumers and competition from comparable venues in terms of, among other things, accessibility and cost;\n\u2022\nthe outbreaks of illnesses, such as the recent coronavirus outbreak, or the perceived risk of such outbreaks, in locations where we operate land-based health and wellness centers or locations from which guests of such wellness centers are sourced;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis and floods;\n\u2022\npossible labor unrest or changes in economics based on collective bargaining activities;\n\u2022\nchanges in ownership, maintenance or room rates of, or popular travel patterns and guest demographics at the venues we serve;\n\u2022\npossible conversion of guest rooms at hotels to condominium units and the decrease in health and wellness center usage that often accompanies such conversions, and the related risk that condominium hotels are less likely to be suitable venues for our health and wellness centers;\n\u2022\nreductions in resort occupancy during major renovations or as a result of damage or other causes;\n\u2022\nacquisition by resort chains of health and wellness service providers to create captive \u201cin-house\u201d brands and development by resort chains of their own proprietary health and wellness service providers, reducing the opportunity for third-party health and wellness providers like us; and\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of the airline industry, as well as elimination of, or reduction in, airline service to locations where we operate resort facilities, which would result in fewer guests at those venues.\nWe Compete with Passenger Activity Alternatives\nWe compete with passenger activity alternatives on cruise ships and with competing providers of services and products similar to our services and products seeking agreements with cruise lines. Casinos, bars and a variety of shops are found on almost all of the ships served by us. In addition, ships dock in ports which provide opportunities for additional shopping as well as other activities that compete with us for passenger attention and disposable income, and cruise ships are increasingly offering itineraries providing for greater numbers of port days. Cruise ships also typically offer swimming pools and other recreational facilities and activities, as well as musical and other entertainment, all without additional charge to the passengers. Certain cruise lines we formerly served have engaged the services of third parties or their own personnel for the operation of the health and wellness centers for all or some of their ships. Additional cruise lines could take similar actions in the future. In addition, there are certain other entities offering services in the cruise industry similar to those provided by us and we may not be able to serve new cruise ships that come into service and that are not covered by our cruise line agreements.\nMany of the land-based venues that we serve or may serve in the future offer recreational entertainment facilities and activities similar to those offered on cruise ships, often without additional charge to guests. A number of the hotels we serve also offer casino gambling. These activities and facilities compete with us for customer time and disposable income. Our destination resort health and wellness centers also compete with other health and wellness centers in their vicinities, as well as with other beauty, relaxation or other therapeutic alternatives. These include salons that offer these services at prices significantly lower than those charged by us. We believe, however, that the prices charged by us are appropriate for the quality of the experience we provide in our respective markets. In addition, we also compete, both for customers and for contracts with hotels, with health and wellness centers and beauty salons owned or operated by companies that have offered their destination resort health and wellness services longer than we have, some of which enjoy greater name recognition with customers and prospective customers than health and wellness centers operated by us. Also, a number of these health and wellness center operators may have greater resources than we do. Further, some hotel operators provide health and wellness services themselves. If we are unable to compete effectively in one or more areas of our operations, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Non-U.S. Operations and Hostilities\nThe cruise lines we serve operate in waters and call on ports throughout the world and our destination resort health and wellness centers are located in a variety of countries. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks, including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions, volatile local political conditions, potential changes in duties and taxes, including changing and/or uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations, required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreign-based companies, currency fluctuations, interest rate movements, difficulties in operating under local business environments, port quality and availability in certain regions, U.S. and global anti-bribery laws or regulations, imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings.\nOperating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal, regulatory and tax requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations. However, we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees, agents, representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them. Failure by us, our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties, sanctions, damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a global operator, our business may also be impacted by changes in U.S. policy or priorities in areas such as trade, immigration and/or environmental or labor regulations, among others. Depending on the nature and scope of any such changes, they could impact our domestic and international business operations. Any such changes, and any international response to them, could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel and/or cross border transactions, impact our guest experience and/or increase our operating costs.\nThe waters and countries in which we operate include geographic regions that, from time to time, experience political and civil unrest and armed hostilities. Political unrest in areas where we operate health and wellness centers also has adversely affected our operations and continued political unrest in the Middle East has adversely affected the travel industry in that region. The threat of additional attacks and of armed hostilities internationally or locally may cause prospective travelers to cancel their plans, including plans for cruise or land-based venue vacations. Weaker cruise industry and land-based venue performance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to address these risks adequately, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected, including potentially impairing the value of our shipboard spas and other assets.\nSevere Weather Can Disrupt Our Operations\nOur operations may be impacted by adverse weather patterns or other natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fires, tornados, tsunamis, typhoons and volcanic eruptions. It is possible that cruises we serve could be forced to alter itineraries or cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or tours due to these or other factors, which would have an adverse effect on our net revenue yields and profitability. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods and typhoons, may not only cause disruption, alteration, or cancellation of cruises and closures of destination resort health and wellness centers but may also adversely impact commercial airline flights and other transport or prevent certain individuals from electing to utilize our offerings altogether. In addition, these extreme weather conditions could result in increased wave and wind activity, which would make it more challenging to sail and dock ships and could cause sea/motion sickness among guests and crew on the ships we serve. These events could have an adverse impact on the safety and satisfaction of cruising and could have an adverse impact on our net revenue yields and profitability. Additionally, these extreme weather conditions could impact our ability to provide our cruise products and services as well as to obtain insurance coverage for operations in such areas at reasonable rates.\nRisk of Early Termination of Land-Based Health and Wellness Center Agreements\nA number of our land-based health and wellness center agreements provide that landlords may terminate the agreement prior to its expiration date (provided, in some cases, that we receive certain compensation with respect to our build-out expenses and earnings lost as a result of such termination). While we always attempt to negotiate the best deal we can in this regard, we may not be able to successfully negotiate a termination fee in any of our future agreements or that any amounts we would receive in connection with such termination accurately reflects the economic value of the assets we would be leaving behind as a result of such termination. In addition, in the event of certain terminations of an agreement with a land-based venue, such as by the venue operator after our breach of an agreement, or as a result of the bankruptcy of a venue, even if we have a provision in our agreement providing for a termination payment, we could receive no compensation with respect to build-out expenditures we have incurred.\nWe also attempt to obtain terms in our land-based health and wellness center agreements that protect us in the event that the lessor\u2019s lender forecloses and takes over the property in question. However, we cannot always obtain such protective \u201cnon-disturbance\u201d terms. In the event that the lender to a land-based venue owner under an agreement where no such non-disturbance term is included forecloses on that property, our agreement could be terminated prior to the expiration of its term. In such case, in addition to the loss of income from that health and wellness center, we could lose the residual value of any investment we made to build out that facility.\nDelays in New Ship Introductions Could Slow Our Growth\nOur growth depends, in part, on our serving new cruise ships brought into service. A number of cruise lines we serve have experienced in the past and recently, and could experience in the future, delays in bringing new ships into service. In addition, there is a limited number of shipyards in the world capable of constructing large cruise ships in accordance with the standards of major cruise lines. This also may contribute to delays in new ship construction. Such delays could slow our growth and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in and Compliance with Laws and Regulations Relating to Environment, Health, Safety, Security, Data Privacy and Protection, Tax and Anti-Corruption under Which We Operate May Lead to Litigation, Enforcement Actions, Fines, or Penalties\nWe are subject to numerous international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties covering many areas, including social issues, health, safety, security, data privacy and protection, and tax. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, treaties and agreements could lead and has led to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. Accordingly, new legislation, regulations or treaties, or changes thereto, could impact our operations and would likely subject us to increased compliance costs in the future. In addition, training of crew may become more time consuming and may increase our operating costs due to increasing regulatory and other requirements.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances or vessel discharges, including ballast water and waste disposal, could materially adversely affect our business, profitability and financial condition. Some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships. Various agencies and regulatory organizations have enacted or are considering new regulations or policies, such as stricter emission limits to reduce greenhouse gas effects, which could adversely impact the cruise industry.\nOur guest and employee relationships provide us with access to sensitive data. We are subject to laws and requirements related to the treatment and protection of such sensitive data. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we do not comply with data privacy and protection regulations. Various governments, agencies and regulatory organizations have enacted and are considering new regulations and implementation of rules for existing regulations. Additional requirements could negatively impact our ability to market cruises to consumers and increase our costs.\nWe are subject to the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect in May 2018 and imposes significant obligations to businesses that sell products or services to EU customers or otherwise control or process personal data of EU residents. Should we violate or not comply with the GDPR, or any other applicable laws or regulations, contractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities.\nWe are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate. There can be no assurance that the outcome from these examinations will not adversely affect our profitability.\nAs budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate, increases in income or other taxes affecting our operations may be imposed. Some social activist groups have lobbied for more taxation on income generated by cruise companies. Certain groups have also generated negative publicity for us. In recent years, certain members of the U.S. Congress have proposed various forms of legislation that would result in higher taxation on income generated by cruise companies.\nOur global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, economic sanctions, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\u201d) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. While we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions or limitations on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may also be affected by changes in economic sanctions, trade protection laws, policies, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we improperly sell goods or otherwise operate improperly in areas subject to economic sanctions such as Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria or if we improperly engage in business transactions with persons subject to economic sanctions.\nThese various international laws and regulations could lead and have led to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in significant awards or settlements to plaintiffs and civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or profitability, even if the monetary damage is mitigated by our insurance coverage.\nAs a result of ship or other incidents, litigation claims, enforcement actions and regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding areas, may be asserted or brought against various parties, including us. The time and attention of our management may also be diverted in defending such claims, actions and investigations. We may also incur costs both in defending against any claims, actions and investigations and for any judgments, fines, or civil or criminal penalties if such claims, actions or investigations are adversely determined and not covered by our insurance policies.\nProduct Liability and Other Potential Claims Could Adversely Affect Us\nThe nature and use of our products and services could give rise to liability if a customer were injured while receiving one of our services. Guests at our health and wellness centers could be injured, among other things, in connection with their use of our fitness equipment, sauna facilities or other facilities. If any of these events occurred, we could incur substantial litigation expense and be required to make payments in connection with settlements of claims or as a result of judgments against us.\nWe maintain insurance to cover a number of risks associated with our business. While we seek to obtain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates, we cannot be certain that appropriate insurance will be available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our insurance policies are subject to coverage limit, exclusions and deductible levels and are subject to non-renewal upon termination at the option of the applicable insurance company. Our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates for the potential liabilities that we face could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in connection with insured claims, we bear the risks associated with the fact that insurers often control decisions relating to pre-trial settlement of claims and other significant aspects of claims and their decisions may prove to not be in our best interest in all cases.\nWe believe that our current coverage is adequate to protect us against most of the significant risks involved in the conduct of our business, but we self-insure or use higher deductibles for various risks. Accordingly, we are not protected against all risks (including failures by third-party service providers such as insurance brokers to fulfill their duties), which could result in unexpected increases in our expenses in the event of certain claims against us.\nIf the types of services we offer increase, the potential for claims against us also could increase. We self-insure potential claims regarding certain of our medi-spa services. High visibility claims also could cause us to receive adverse publicity and suffer a loss of sales, and, therefore, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in such cases. We are, and may in the future be, subject to other legal proceedings, including claims presented as class actions. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters. It is reasonably possible that the final resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Indebtedness Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Ability to Operate and We May Incur Additional Debt\nAs of March 19, 2020, we have $247.5 million of secured indebtedness under our First Lien Term Loan Facility and Second Lien Term Loan Facility, and our First Lien Revolving Facility (collectively, the \u201cNew Credit Facilities\u201d). Our debt level and the terms of our financing arrangements could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies. In addition, under the New Credit Facilities, certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries have granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of their assets. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by the other risk factors described herein. If we do not generate enough cash flow to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell our assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nThe New Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nOur Credit Facilities Contain Financial and Other Covenants. The Failure to Comply with Such Covenants Could Have An Adverse Effect on Us\nOur New Credit Facilities contain certain financial covenants and a number of traditional negative covenants, including limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions, and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the New Credit Facilities, including any failure to comply with certain financial covenants due to the negative effects of the coronavirus on our revenue and results of operations, may result in an event of default under the agreements. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the New Credit Facilities are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the New Credit Facilities and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor, subject to customary intercreditor provisions among the first and second lien secured parties.\nIf We Are Unable to Execute Our Growth Strategies, Including Our Ability to Offer and Integrate New Services and Products, Our Business Could Be Adversely Affected\nThe demands of consumers with respect to health and wellness services and products continue to evolve. Among other things, there is a continuing trend to add services at health and wellness centers similar to those traditionally provided in medical facilities, including services relating to skin care. If we are unable to identify and capture new audiences, our ability to successfully integrate additional services and products will be adversely affected. Our ability to provide certain additional services depends on our ability to find appropriate third parties with whom to work in connection with these services and, in certain cases, could be dependent on our ability to fund substantial costs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find such appropriate third parties or be able to fund such costs. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our health and wellness services sufficiently to keep up with consumer demand. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategies or continue to maintain sales at our current rate, or at all. If we fail to implement our growth strategies, our sales and profitability may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Business Could Be Adversely Affected if We Are Unable to Successfully Protect Our Trademarks or Obtain New Trademarks\nThe market for our services and products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our brand names. Although we take appropriate steps to protect our brand names, in the future, we may not be successful in asserting trademark protection in connection with our efforts to grow our business or otherwise due to the nature of certain of our marks or for other reasons. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial. If other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands in the marketplace may be diluted. In addition, any infringement of our intellectual property rights would likely result in a commitment of our time and resources to protect these rights through litigation or otherwise. One or more adverse judgments with respect to these intellectual property rights could negatively impact our ability to compete and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Are Subject to Currency Risk\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar can impact our results of operations, most significantly because we pay for the administration of recruitment and training of our shipboard personnel in U.K. pounds sterling and Euros. Accordingly, while the relative strength of the U.S. dollar has improved recently, renewed weakness of the U.S. dollar against those currencies can adversely affect our results of operations, as has occurred in some recent years. To the extent that the U.K. pound sterling or the Euro is stronger than the U.S. dollar, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe May Be Exposed to the Threat of Cyber Attacks and/or Data Breaches\nCyberattacks can vary in scope and intent from economically driven attacks to malicious attacks targeting our key operating systems with the intent to disrupt, disable or otherwise cripple our maritime and/or land-based operations. This can include any combination of phishing attacks, malware and/or viruses targeted at our key systems. The breadth and scope of this threat has grown over time, and the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks, as well as the sources and targets of the attacks, change frequently. While we invest time, effort and capital resources to secure our key systems and networks, we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all such attacks.\nA successful cyberattack may target us directly, or may be the result of a third-party vendor\u2019s inadequate care. In either scenario, we may suffer damage to our key systems and/or data that could interrupt our operations, adversely impact our reputation and brand and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in systems technology, personnel, monitoring and other investments.\nIn addition to malicious cyberattacks, we are also subject to various risks associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of sensitive information. In the course of doing business, we collect large volumes of internal, customer and other third-party data, including personally identifiable information and individual credit data, for various business purposes. We are subject to federal, state and international laws (including the GDPR), as well as industry standards, relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual credit data. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, and among us, our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements has caused, and may cause, us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. If we fail to comply with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws, we could be exposed to fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation or other expenses, and our business could be adversely impacted.\nEven if we are fully compliant with legal and/or industry standards and any relevant contractual requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data and/or critical systems. Any breach, theft, loss, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, third-party or company data, could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers, and expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. Further, if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nChanges in Privacy Law Could Adversely Affect Our Ability to Market Our Services Effectively\nOur ability to market our services effectively is an important component of our business. We rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email marketing, and direct mail. Any further restrictions under laws such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, the GDPR, and various United States state laws or new federal laws regarding marketing and solicitation, or international data protection laws that govern these activities, could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing, email, and postal mailing techniques and could force further changes in our marketing strategy. If this were to occur, we may be unable to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could impact our ability to effectively market and sell our services.\nIn addition, we collect information relating to our customers for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data, such as, among other things, credit card information, is governed by privacy laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Privacy regulations continue to evolve and, occasionally, may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our services and products and serve our customers. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us or, in some instances, non-compliance by third parties engaged by us, or a breach of security systems storing our data may result in fines, payment of damages or restrictions on our use or transfer of data.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nSteiner Leisure Owns a Significant Portion of Our Shares and Has Representation on Our Board; Steiner Leisure May Have Interests That Differ from Those of Other Shareholders\nApproximately 14% of our common shares are beneficially owned by Steiner Leisure. One of our directors was nominated by Steiner Leisure, and as a result, Steiner Leisure may be able to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted for director action, subject to our directors\u2019 obligation to act in the interest of all of our shareholders, and for shareholder action, including the designation and appointment of the OneSpaWorld Board (and committees thereof) and approval of significant corporate transactions, including business combinations, consolidations and mergers. The influence of Steiner Leisure over our management could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which could cause the market price of our common shares to decline or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for our common shares.\nUnder the \u201cBusiness Opportunities\u201d section of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (our \u201cArticles\u201d), among other things, we have renounced any interest or expectancy of us or our subsidiaries being offered an opportunity to participate in any potential transaction opportunities available to Steiner Leisure and certain of its affiliates and related parties, such parties have no obligation to communicate or offer such potential transaction opportunities to us, and such parties will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar businesses as us. Prospective investors in our common shares should consider that the interests of Steiner Leisure may differ from their interests in material respects.\nIf We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able to Accurately Report Our Financial Results or Prevent Fraud; as a Result, Shareholders Could Lose Confidence in Our Financial and Other Public Reporting, Which Is Likely to Negatively Affect Our Business and the Market Price of Our Common Shares\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in our implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing conducted by us, or any testing conducted by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which is likely to negatively affect our business and the market price of our shares.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually.\nHowever, for as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nThe Market Price and Trading Volume of Our Common Shares Has Been and May Continue to Be Volatile\nThe stock markets, including Nasdaq, on which we have listed our common shares, have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. The market price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly, as has recently happened as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and related economic uncertainty. In addition, the trading volume in our common shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common shares will not fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nthe realization of any of the risk factors presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated differences in our estimates, or in the estimates of analysts, for our revenues, results of operations, level of indebtedness, liquidity or financial condition;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances, sales or resales, or anticipated issuances, sales or resales, of our common shares;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our wellness centers, or the lodging industry generally;\n\u2022\nthe performance and market valuations of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nbroad disruptions in the financial markets, as have occurred as a result of the recent coronavirus outbreak, including sudden disruptions in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nactual, potential or perceived control, accounting or reporting problems; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles, policies and guidelines.\nIn the past, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their shares. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf Securities or Industry Analysts Do Not Publish Research, Publish Inaccurate or Unfavorable Research or Cease Publishing Research About Us, Our Share Price and Trading Volume Could Decline Significantly\nThe market for our common shares will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the market price and liquidity for our common shares could be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their opinions about our common shares, publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, or cease publishing about us regularly, demand for our common shares could decrease, which might cause our share price and trading volume to decline significantly.\nFuture Issuances of Debt Securities and/or Equity Securities May Adversely Affect Us, Including the Market Price of Our Common Shares, and May Be Dilutive to Our Existing Shareholders\nIn the future, we may incur debt and/or issue equity ranking senior to our common shares. Those securities will generally have priority upon liquidation. Such securities also may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common shares. Because our decision to issue debt and/or equity in the future will depend, in part, on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts. As a result, future capital raising efforts may reduce the market price of our common shares and be dilutive to our existing shareholders.\nYou May Have Difficulty Enforcing Judgments Against Us\nWe are an international business company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. A substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to:\n\u2022\neffect service of process within the United States upon us; or\n\u2022\nenforce, against us, court judgments obtained in U.S. courts, including judgments relating to U.S. federal securities laws.\nIt is unlikely that Bahamian courts would entertain original actions against Bahamian companies, their directors or officers predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. The Bahamian courts may apply any rule of Bahamian law which is mandatory irrespective of the governing law and may refuse to apply a rule of such governing law of the relevant documents, if it is manifestly incompatible with the public policy of The Bahamas. Furthermore, judgments based upon any civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws are not directly enforceable in The Bahamas. Rather, a lawsuit must be brought in The Bahamas on any such judgment. The courts of The Bahamas would recognize a U.S. judgment as a valid judgment, and permit the same to provide the basis of a fresh action in The Bahamas and should give a judgment based thereon without there being a re-trial or reconsideration of the merits of the case provided that (i) the courts in the United States had proper jurisdiction under Bahamian conflict of law rules over the parties subject to such judgment, (ii) the judgment is for a debt or definite sum of money other than a sum payable in respect of taxes or charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or penalty, (iii) the U.S. courts did not contravene the rules of natural justice of The Bahamas, (iv) the judgment was not obtained by fraud on the part of the party in whose favor the judgment was given or of the court pronouncing it, (v) the enforcement of such judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of The Bahamas, (vi) the correct procedures under the laws of The Bahamas are duly complied with, (vii) the judgment is not inconsistent with a prior Bahamian judgment in respect of the same matter and (viii) enforcement proceedings are instituted within six years after the date of such judgment.\nCertain Provisions in Our Articles May Limit Shareholders\u2019 Ability to Affect a Change in Management or Control\nOur Articles include certain provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a future takeover or change in control of us that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. Among other things, our Articles provide for a classified Board serving staggered terms of three years, super majority voting requirements with respect to certain significant transactions and restrictions on the acquisition of greater than 9.99% ownership without our Board\u2019s approval. Our equity plans and our officers\u2019 employment agreements provide certain rights to plan participants and those officers, respectively, in the event of a change in control of us.", "PERMNO": 17114, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "OSW"}
