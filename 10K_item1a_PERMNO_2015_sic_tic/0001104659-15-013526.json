{"cik": "901491", "company": "PAPA JOHNS INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks that could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks could cause actual operating results to differ from those expressed in certain \u201cforward looking statements\u201d contained in this Form 10-K as well as in other Company communications. Before you invest in our securities you should carefully consider these risk factors together with all other information included in this Form 10-K and our other publicly filed documents.\nWe face competition from other food industry competitors, and our results of operations can be negatively impacted by the actions of one or more of our competitors.\nThe QSR Pizza category and the restaurant industry in general are intensely competitive, and there are many well-established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than the Papa John\u2019s system. Some of these competitors have been in existence for a substantially longer period than Papa John\u2019s and may be better established in the markets where restaurants operated by us or our franchisees are, or may be, located. Demographic trends, traffic patterns, the type, number and location of competing restaurants, and changes in pricing or other marketing initiatives or promotional strategies, including new product and concept developments, by one or more of our major competitors, can have a rapid and adverse impact on our sales and earnings and our system-wide restaurant operations. Such an adverse impact could also be caused or exacerbated if our marketing incentives or new product offerings are not effective.\nIn addition to more established competitors, we also face competition from new competitors and concepts such as fast casual pizza concepts. The emergence or growth of new competitors may negatively impact our sales and our system-wide restaurant operations.\nChanges in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could adversely impact our results.\nChanges in consumer preferences and trends (for example, changes in dietary preferences that could cause consumers to avoid pizza in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthful, lower-calorie or otherwise based on their nutritional content) or preferences for a dining experience such as fast casual pizza concepts, could adversely affect our restaurant business. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer income and spending and adverse economic conditions such as high levels of unemployment, high fuel and energy costs and reduced access to credit. Such factors could cause consumers to spend less on food or shift to lower-priced products, and adverse changes in these factors could reduce sales or inhibit our ability to increase pricing, either of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nFood safety and quality concerns may negatively impact our business and profitability.\nIncidents or reports of food- or water-borne illness, or other food safety issues, food contamination or tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures, improper employee conduct, or presence of communicable disease at our restaurants, QC Centers, or suppliers could lead to product liability or other claims. Such incidents or reports could negatively affect our brand and reputation and a decrease in customer traffic resulting from these reports could negatively impact our revenues and profits. Similar incidents or reports occurring at quick service restaurants unrelated to us could likewise create negative publicity, which could negatively impact consumer behavior towards us.\nWe rely on our domestic and international suppliers, as do our franchisees, to provide quality ingredients and to comply with applicable laws and industry standards. A failure of one of our domestic or international suppliers to meet our quality standards, or meet domestic or international food industry\nstandards, could result in a disruption in our supply chain and negatively impact our brand and our business and profitability. Our inability to manage an event such as a product recall or product related litigation could also cause our results to suffer.\nOur success depends on the differentiation of our brand and maintaining the value and quality reputation of our brand, and any damage to consumers\u2019 perception of our brand may negatively impact our business and profitability.\nOur results depend upon our ability to differentiate our brand and our reputation for quality. Our brand has been highly rated in U.S. surveys, and we strive to build the value of our brand as we develop international markets. The value of our brand and demand for our products could be damaged by incidents that harm consumer perceptions of the Company and our brand, such as product recalls, food safety issues, privacy breaches, or negative publicity. Any actions that persons endorsing our products may take, whether or not associated with our products, which harm their or our reputations could also harm our brand image and our reputation. Social media can be used to promote adverse consumer perceptions with significantly greater speed and scope than traditional media outlets. As a result, the value of our brand and the demand for our products could be damaged and have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may not be able to execute our strategy or achieve our planned growth targets, which could negatively impact our business and our financial results.\nOur growth strategy depends on the Company\u2019s and our franchisees\u2019 ability to open new restaurants and to operate them on a profitable basis. We may fail to attract new qualified franchisees or existing franchisees may close underperforming locations. Planned growth targets and the ability to operate new and existing restaurants profitably are affected by economic, regulatory and competitive conditions and consumer buying habits. Increased commodity or operating costs, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and benefits or insurance costs, could slow the rate of new store openings or increase the number of store closings. Our business is susceptible to adverse changes in local, national and global economic conditions, which could make it difficult for us to meet our growth targets. Additionally, we or our franchisees may face challenges securing financing, finding suitable store locations at acceptable terms or securing required domestic or foreign government permits and approvals.\nOur franchisees remain dependent on the availability of financing to remodel or renovate existing locations, upgrade systems, or construct and open new restaurants. From time to time, the Company may be required to provide financing to certain franchisees and prospective franchisees in order to mitigate store closings, allow new units to open, or complete required upgrades. If we are unable or unwilling to provide such financing, we may experience slower than expected new restaurant openings and our results of operations may be adversely impacted. To the extent we provide financing to franchisees in domestic and international markets, our results could be negatively impacted by the credit performance of our franchisee loans.\nIf we do not meet our growth targets or the expectations of the market for net restaurant openings or our other strategic objectives, our stock price could decline.\nOur results of operations and the operating results of our franchisees may be adversely impacted by increases in the cost of food ingredients and other commodities.\nWe are exposed to ongoing commodity volatility, and an increase in the cost, or sustained high levels of the cost, of cheese or other commodities could adversely affect the profitability of our system-wide restaurant operations, particularly if we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to offset increased costs. Cheese, historically representing 35% to 40% of our food cost, and other commodities\ncan be subject to significant cost fluctuations due to weather, availability, global demand and other factors that are beyond our control. Additionally, increases in fuel, utility, and insurance costs could adversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and QC Center businesses. Most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control, and we may not be able to pass along these costs to our customers or franchisees. Our domestic franchisees buy substantially all of their food products from our QC Center business.\nOur dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers for some ingredients could result in disruptions to our business.\nDomestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our QC Centers. We are dependent on Leprino Foods Dairy Products Company (\u201cLeprino\u201d) as our sole supplier for cheese, one of our key ingredients. Leprino, one of the major pizza category suppliers of cheese in the United States, currently supplies all of our cheese domestically and substantially all of our cheese internationally. While we have no other sole sources of supply, we do source other key ingredients from a limited number of suppliers. Alternative sources of supply of cheese or other key ingredients may not be available on a timely basis or be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current arrangements. Our corporate and franchised restaurants could also be harmed by a prolonged disruption in the supply of products from or to our QC Centers due to weather, crop disease, labor dispute, interruption of service by carriers and other events beyond our control. Insolvency of key suppliers could also cause similar business interruptions and negatively impact our business.\nChanges in purchasing practices by our domestic franchisees could harm our commissary business.\nAlthough our domestic franchisees currently purchase substantially all food products from our QC Centers, they are only required to purchase from our QC Centers tomato sauce, dough and other items we may designate as proprietary or integral to our system. Any changes in purchasing practices by domestic franchisees, such as seeking alternative approved suppliers of ingredients or other food products, could adversely affect the financial results of our QC Centers and the Company.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks and other factors that may make it more difficult to achieve or maintain profitability or meet planned growth rates.\nOur international operations could be negatively impacted by changes in international economic, political and health conditions in the countries in which the Company or our franchisees operate. In addition, there are risks associated with differing business and social cultures and consumer preferences, diverse and sometimes uncertain or unstable government regulations and structures, limited availability and high cost of suitable restaurant locations, and difficulties in sourcing and importing high-quality ingredients and other commodities in a cost-effective manner. In addition, our international operations are subject to additional factors, including import and export controls, compliance with anti-corruption and other foreign laws, volatility in foreign currency rates, changes in tax laws, difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contract rights in foreign jurisdictions, and the imposition of increased or new tariffs or trade barriers. We intend to continue to expand internationally, which would make the risks related to our international operations more significant over time.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing our workforce and our operations. Changes in these laws, including health care legislation and minimum wage increases or additional laws and regulations could increase costs for our system-wide operations.\nWe operate in an increasingly complex regulatory environment, and the cost of regulatory compliance is increasing. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. and international labor, health care, food, safety, anti-bribery and corruption, consumer and other laws, may result in civil and criminal liability, damages, fines\nand penalties. This could harm our reputation, limit our ability to grow and adversely affect our financial performance.\nDomestic system-wide restaurant and QC Center operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages, benefits, working conditions, citizenship requirements and overtime. A significant number of hourly personnel are paid at rates closely related to the federal and state minimum wage requirements. Accordingly, further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases above federal wage rates would increase labor costs for our domestic system-wide operations. Additionally, social media may be used to foster negative perceptions of employment in our industry and promote strikes or boycotts. Local government agencies have also implemented ordinances that restrict the sale of certain food or drink products. Compliance with additional government mandates, including menu labeling requirements, or activist or union activity, could increase costs and be harmful to system-wide restaurant sales.\nThe Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage. We, like other industry competitors, are complying with the law and are providing more extensive health benefits to employees than we had previously provided, and are subsidizing a larger portion of their insurance premiums. These additional costs could negatively impact our operational results.\nOur expansion into emerging or under-penetrated domestic and international markets may present increased risks.\nAny or all of the risks listed above could be even more harmful to the financial viability of our franchisees or could significantly impact the operating results of the Company in markets where we have a Company-owned presence, such as China. A decline in or failure to improve financial performance could lead to reduced new restaurant openings or unit closings at greater than anticipated levels and therefore adversely impact our ability to achieve our targets for growth and results of operations as well as have a negative impact on market share.\nOur business and brand may be harmed should the services of our Founder, John Schnatter, as Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman or brand spokesman terminate for any reason. Failure to effectively execute succession planning could harm our Company and brand.\nJohn H. Schnatter, our Founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, does not serve under an employment agreement, and we do not maintain key man life insurance on Mr. Schnatter. We also depend on the continued availability of Mr. Schnatter\u2019s image and his services as spokesman in our advertising and promotion materials. While we have entered into a license agreement with Mr. Schnatter related to the use of certain intellectual property related to his name, likeness and image, our business and brand may be harmed if Mr. Schnatter\u2019s services were not available to the Company for any reason or the reputation of Mr. Schnatter were negatively impacted. In addition, failure to effectively execute succession planning could harm our Company and brand.\nWe may be required to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on the Papa John\u2019s brand name and rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property rights to protect and promote our brand. We believe the success of our business depends on our continued ability to exclusively use our existing marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand, both domestically and abroad. If we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to resort to litigation to prevent consumer confusion and preserve our brand\u2019s high-quality reputation. Litigation could result in high\ncosts and diversion of resources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, regardless of the outcome.\nDisruptions of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including digital ordering solutions, through which approximately half of our domestic sales originate. We also rely heavily on point-of-sale processing in our restaurants for data collection and payment systems for the collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions, and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends on the reliability and capacity of these technology systems. In addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally, both domestically and internationally. Our failure to adequately invest in new technology, particularly our digital ordering capabilities, could cause us to lose our competitive advantage and have an adverse effect on our results.\nOur systems could be damaged or interrupted by power loss through various technological failures or acts of God. In particular, we may experience occasional interruptions of our digital ordering solutions, which make online ordering unavailable or slow to respond, negatively impacting sales and the experience of our customers. If our digital ordering solutions do not perform with adequate speed, our customers may be less inclined to return to our digital ordering solutions, as frequently or at all. If our systems do not operate properly, we may not be able to fully realize the significant investment we have made in these systems, and we may need to upgrade or replace these systems, which could require additional material capital investment from us and our franchisees. Part of our technology infrastructure, such as our FOCUS point of sale system, is specifically designed for us and our operational systems, which could cause unexpected costs, delays or inefficiencies when infrastructure upgrades are needed or prolonged and widespread technological difficulties occur. Significant portions of our technology infrastructure are provided by third parties, and the performance of these systems is largely beyond our control. Failure of our third-party systems, and backup systems, to adequately perform, particularly as our online sales grow, could harm our business and the satisfaction of our customers. In addition, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate protection or insurance to mitigate the risks of these events or compensate for losses related to these events, which could damage our business and reputation and be expensive and difficult to remedy or repair.\nWe may incur significant costs or loss of sales and consumer confidence resulting from a security breach of our critical systems, network sites or service providers, including a breach of confidential customer information from our digital ordering business.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card data and other personally identifiable information of our employees and customers housed in the various information systems we use. Constantly changing cyber security threats pose risks to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality of our data. As techniques used in cyber attacks evolve, we may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement security measures. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and Company data is critical to us. The failure to prevent fraud or security breaches or to adequately invest in data security could harm our business and revenues due to the reputational damage to our brand. Such a breach could also result in litigation, regulatory actions, penalties, and other significant costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nChanges in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email, text messages and postal mailings. Any future restrictions in federal, state or foreign laws regarding marketing and solicitation or\ninternational data protection laws that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of email, text messages and postal mailing techniques and could force changes in our marketing strategies. If this occurs, we may need to develop alternative marketing strategies, which could impact the amount and timing of our revenues.\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to various types of litigation, including collective and class action litigation, which could subject us to significant damages or other remedies.\nWe and our restaurant industry competitors are subject to the risk of litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, franchisees, state and federal agencies, and employees. We are involved in a number of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings consisting of intellectual property, employment, consumer, commercial and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We are currently a defendant in cases containing collective and class action allegations. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. Litigation trends involving the relationship between franchisors and franchisees, personal injury claims, employment law and intellectual property may increase our cost of doing business. We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the amount of potential losses to us. In many cases, particularly collective and class action cases, we may not be able to estimate the amount of potential losses and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.\nIf pending legal matters, including the class action litigation described in \u201cNote 17\u201d of \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d result in costs in excess of amounts we have accrued, our results of operations could be materially impacted.\nWe may be subject to impairment charges.\nImpairment charges are possible due to the nature and timing of decisions we make about underperforming assets or markets, or if previously opened or acquired restaurants perform below our expectations, particularly in our Company-owned China market. This could result in a decrease in our reported asset value and reduction in our net income.", "PERMNO": 79299, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "PZZA"}
