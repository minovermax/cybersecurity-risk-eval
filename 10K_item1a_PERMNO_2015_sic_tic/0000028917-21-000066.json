{"cik": "28917", "company": "DILLARD'S, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe risks described in this Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on public health, our supply chain, the health and well-being of our employees and customers, and the retail industry in general, has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a strain of coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since that time, the virus has rapidly spread to other countries around the world, including the United States. In response to the pandemic, national and local governments, including those in the regions in which we operate, have taken various measures to attempt to slow the spread of the virus, including travel bans; prohibitions on group events and large gatherings; extended shutdowns of schools, government offices and certain businesses; curfews and recommendations to practice \u201csocial distancing.\u201d Accordingly, the Company began closing its stores on March 19, 2020, and all 285 store locations were temporarily closed by April 9, 2020.\nThe Company reopened all stores as of June 2, 2020. Stores are operating at reduced hours and implementing certain safety measures to ensure the safety of our customers and associates, which may have the effect of discouraging shopping or limiting the occupancy of our stores. These measures, and any additional measures that have been and may continue to be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have substantially decreased and may continue to decrease, the number of customers that visit our stores and the shopping malls in which our stores are located, which has had, and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is unclear how long these measures may remain in place, what additional measures may be imposed, or if our operations will be restored to the levels that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, our business depends on consumer discretionary spending, and as such, our results are particularly sensitive to economic conditions and consumer confidence. COVID-19 significantly impacted economic conditions, resulting in, among other things, unprecedented increases in the number of people seeking jobless benefits and decreased shopping within our sector. Although the instances of COVID-19 transmission within the United States have recently declined, it is difficult to predict when and to what extent consumer demand for the products we sell will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result, even if all of our store locations are fully operational, there can be no guarantee that our revenue will return to its pre-COVID-19 levels.\nThe Company sources a significant portion of its private label and exclusive brand merchandise from countries that have experienced widespread transmission of the virus, including China. Additionally, many of the Company\u2019s branded merchandise vendors may also source a significant portion of their merchandise from these same countries. Manufacturing capacity in those countries has been materially impacted by the pandemic, which has negatively impacted our supply chain. If this continues, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to locate alternative sources of supply for our merchandise on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to adequately source our merchandise or purchase appropriate amounts of merchandise from branded vendors, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, in the event that the Company were to experience widespread transmission of the virus at one or more of the Company\u2019s stores or other facilities, the Company could suffer reputational harm or other potential liability. Further, the Company\u2019s business operations may be materially and adversely affected if a significant number of the Company\u2019s employees are impacted by the virus.\nRisks Related to Retail Operations\nThe retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.\nWe conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability. We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Although we are a large regional department store, some of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial resources and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of merchandise that we sell. In recent years, competition has intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity, deep price discounting, and few barriers to entry. Also, online retail shopping continues to rapidly evolve, and we continue to expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. We anticipate that intense competition will continue from both existing competitors and new entrants. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.\nOur business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.\nOur business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nA shutdown of, or disruption in, any of the Company's distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.\nOur business depends on the orderly operation of the process of receiving and distributing merchandise, which relies on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution or fulfillment centers. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and that we have appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or other shipping problems may result in the loss of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.\nCurrent store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn order to generate customer traffic and for convenience of our customers, we attempt to locate our stores in desirable locations within shopping malls and open air centers. Our stores benefit from the abilities that our Company, other anchor tenants and other area attractions have to generate consumer traffic. Adverse changes in the development of new shopping malls in the United States, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, the success of individual shopping malls and the success or failure of other anchor tenants, the continued proper management and development of existing malls, or the continued popularity of shopping malls may continue to impact our ability to maintain or grow our sales in our existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOwnership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.\nWe own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of our real estate assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area. Additionally, we are subject to potential liability for environmental conditions on the property that we own or lease. If an existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate\nrenewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third-party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to \"named storms.\" As a result, the repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from \"named storms,\" which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nVariations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reduction in the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which could increase/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number of employees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operating income, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.\nA decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.\nOur business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of available financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share.\nOur profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.\nOur merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer traffic in our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.\nThe occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues (including the recent COVID-19 pandemic) could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores or directly to customers. As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, acts of violence or acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues (including the recent COVID-19 pandemic) in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Consumer Demand\nChanges in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Due to the Company's concentration of stores in energy producing regions, volatile conditions in these regions could adversely affect the Company's sales. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline\nduring recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences and other fashion-related factors.\nOur sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory and lower gross margins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Brand and Product Offerings\nOur failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty. As discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, our brand and customer loyalty depend, in part, on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could diminish brand and customer loyalty and impact our reputation with customers.\nAdditionally, the value of our reputation is based, in part, on subjective perceptions of the quality of our merchandise selections. Isolated incidents involving us or our merchandise that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business, particularly if the incidents result in significant adverse publicity or governmental investigation or inquiry. Similarly, information posted about us, including our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, on the Internet, including social media platforms that allow individuals access to a wide audience of consumers and other interested persons, may adversely affect our reputation, even if the information is inaccurate.\nAny significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation.\nRisks associated with our private label merchandise program could adversely affect our business.\nOur merchandise selections include our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, such as Antonio Melani, Gianni Bini, GB, Roundtree & Yorke and Daniel Cremieux. We expect to grow our private label merchandise program and have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts related to these exclusive brand offerings. The expansion of our private label merchandise subjects us to certain additional risks. These include, among others, risks related to: our failure to comply with government and industry safety standards; our ability to successfully protect our trademark and license portfolio and our other proprietary rights in our exclusive brands/private label merchandise program; and risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. In addition, damage to the reputation of our private label trade names may generate negative customer sentiment. Our failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Material Sourcing and Supply\nFluctuations in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.\nFluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Vendors and other suppliers of the Company may experience similar fluctuations, which may subject us to the effects of their price increases. We may or may not be able to pass such costs along to our customers. Even when successful, attempts to pass such costs along to our customers might cause a decline in our sales volume. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability and the ability of our branded vendors to meet purchasing requirements in a timely manner. Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.\nThird party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities and other third parties with whom we do business may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic conditions, which may subject them to insolvency risk or may result in their inability or unwillingness to perform the obligations they owe us.\nOur suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers\u2019 cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis.\nWe are also party to contractual and business relationships with various other parties, including vendors and service providers, pursuant to which such parties owe performance, payment and other obligations to us. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, such as advertising, software development and support, logistics and other goods and services necessary to operate our business. Economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to us associated with the potential financial distress of such third parties.\nIf any of the third parties with which we do business become subject to insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, our rights and benefits in relation to, contractual and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us, or otherwise materially impaired. There can be no assurances that we would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contractual or business relationships on terms as favorable as our existing ones, if at all. Any inability on our part to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company and third-party suppliers on whom we rely source a significant portion of the merchandise we sell from foreign countries, which exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions and supply chain disruptions.\nPolitical discourse in the United States continues to focus on ways to discourage corporations in the United States from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions. Since 2018, the United States has imposed additional tariffs on certain items sourced from foreign countries, including China, and has modified, withdrawn from and renegotiated some of its trade agreements with foreign countries. While recent tariffs and modifications to trade agreements have not resulted in a material impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, any additional actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability and the ability of our third-party vendors and suppliers to source products from foreign jurisdictions and could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect our profitability.\nOther trade restrictions imposed by the United States government, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could adversely affect our profitability. For example, in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021, the United States Government took significant steps to address the forced labor concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, including withhold release orders (\u201cWROs\") issued by United States Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d). The WROs allow CBP to detain and deny entry of imports suspected of containing cotton from Xinjiang, regardless of the origin of the finished products. This in turn may have an effect on global supply chains, including our own supply chains for cotton-containing products.\nOur timely receipt of merchandise in the United States is dependent on an efficient global supply chain. Disruptions in the supply chain could adversely impact our ability to obtain adequate inventory on a timely basis and result in lost sales, increased costs and an overall decrease in our profits. For example, many disruptions in the global transportation network have occurred in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19 and other factors. The California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together handle a significant portion of United States merchandise imports including our own imports, have experienced and are expected to continue experiencing delays in processing imported merchandise, thereby resulting in untimely deliveries of merchandise and additional freight costs.\nMoreover, our third-party suppliers in foreign jurisdictions are subject to political and economic uncertainty. As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries where our suppliers are located, including increased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions and quotas; human rights concerns; working conditions and other labor rights and conditions; the environmental impact in foreign countries where merchandise is produced and raw materials or products are sourced; adverse foreign government regulations; wars, fears of war, terrorist attacks and organizing activities; adverse fluctuations of foreign currencies; and political unrest. We cannot predict when, or the extent to which, the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the foregoing events. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our operating results.\nFailure by third party suppliers to comply with our supplier compliance programs or applicable laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAll of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one or more of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing and production, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly to consumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.\nRisks Related to our Long-Term Marketing and Servicing Alliance\nReductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to the private label credit cards could impact operating results and cash flows.\nWells Fargo owns and manages the private label credit cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance. The Wells Fargo Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by Wells Fargo to the Company, including the Company's share of earnings under this alliance. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of balances carried on the Wells Fargo accounts by Wells Fargo customers, payment rates on Wells Fargo accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of credit losses for the Wells Fargo accounts, Wells Fargo's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws and from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCredit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts, and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider. Wells Fargo may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of the private label credit card. To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our earnings associated with the private label credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty. Such changes could also negatively impact Wells Fargo's ability to facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders.\nThe Wells Fargo Alliance expires in November 2024. If, when the Wells Fargo Alliance expires, Wells Fargo is unable or unwilling to renew and continue owning and managing our proprietary credit cards on similar terms and conditions as exist today or we are unable to quickly and adequately contract with a comparable replacement vendor, then our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected due to a decrease in credit card sales to our cardholding customers and a loss of revenues attributable to payments from Wells Fargo.\nWe are subject to customer payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, debit cards, credit cards (including the private label credit cards), gift cards and other alternative payment channels. As a result, we are subject to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems.\nThe regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs or accelerate these costs. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Information Security Risks\nA privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.\nWe receive and store certain personal information about our employees and our customers, including information permitting cashless payments, both in our stores and through our online operations at dillards.com. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.\nWe have a longstanding Information Security Program committed to regular risk assessment and risk mitigation practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes network segmentation along with identity and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential data as well as encryption and tokenization of credit card data. We continue to evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, and we regularly institute additional measures to help protect us from a potential privacy breach.\nDespite our security measures, it is possible that unauthorized persons (through cyberattacks, which are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, physical breach or other means) might defeat our security measures, those of Wells Fargo or of our other third-party service providers or vendors, and obtain personal information of customers, employees or others. While we likewise have measures in place to prevent exposing the personal information of customers, employees or others, we are at continued risk for exposure of such information.\nWe have purchased Cyber Risk Liability insurance to provide some financial protection should a privacy breach occur; however, such a compromise, whether in our information security system or our third-party service providers or vendors, resulting in personal information being obtained by or exposed to unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. For example, customers have an increasingly high expectation that companies will adequately protect their personal information from security breaches or cyberattacks and unauthorized exposure. Our reputation and our ability to attract new customers could be materially adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly prevent and respond to these incidents. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.\nA security breach also could result in a violation attributable to the Company of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation by private customers, business partners, or securities litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. The regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Security breaches, cyber incidents or allegations that we used personal information in violation of applicable privacy and other laws could result in significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur operations are dependent on information technology systems, and disruptions in those systems could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company's computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company's employees. If the Company's computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company's computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations. Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in business operations.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nLitigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection, employment and\nprivacy and information security laws. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects and to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. We are also subject to claims filed under our employee stock ownership plan alleging failure to properly manage the plan. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.\nRisks Related to Construction Operations\nThe cost-to-cost method of accounting that we use to recognize contract revenues for our construction segment may result in material adjustments, which could result in a credit or a charge against our earnings.\nOur construction segment recognizes contract revenues based on the cost-to-cost method. Under this method, estimated contract revenues are measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.\nRisks Related to Employees\nThe Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.\nThe Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, changing demographics, prevailing wage rates and current or future minimum wage and healthcare reform legislation. In addition, as a complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics. Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.\nIncreases in employee wages and the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company\u2019s financial results and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s expenses relating to employee wages and health benefits are significant. Increases in employee wages, including the minimum wage, or unfavorable changes in the cost of healthcare benefits could impact the Company\u2019s financial results and cash flows. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to the breadth and complexity of the U.S. healthcare system, and uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, the Company is not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on our company sponsored medical plans.", "PERMNO": 49429, "SIC": 5311, "TIC": "DDS"}
