{"cik": "1267238", "company": "ASSURANT, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. You should carefully consider them, along with the other information presented in this Report. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBusiness and Competitive Risks\nOur revenues and profits may decline if we are unable to maintain relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties face financial, reputational or regulatory issues.\nThe success of our business depends largely on our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients, distributors and other parties, including vendors. Many of these arrangements are exclusive and some rely on preferred provider or similar relationships. If our key clients, distributors, vendors or other parties terminate important business arrangements with us, or renew contracts on terms less favorable to us, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nEach of our Global Lifestyle, Global Housing and Global Preneed segments receives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few clients. A reduction in business with or the loss of one or more of our significant clients could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows of individual segments or the Company. Our segments\u2019 reliance on a few significant clients may weaken our bargaining power and we may be unable to renew contracts with them on favorable terms or at all. Examples of important business arrangements include, at Global Lifestyle, exclusive and non-exclusive relationships with mobile device carriers, retailers, dealerships, MSOs, OEMs and financial and other institutions through which we distribute our products and services. At Global Housing, we have exclusive and non-exclusive relationships with mortgage lenders and servicers, manufactured housing lenders, property managers and financial and other institutions. At Global Preneed, we have an exclusive distribution relationship with SCI relating to the distribution of our preneed insurance policies.\nWe are also subject to the risk that clients, distributors and other parties may face financial difficulties, reputational issues, problems with respect to their own products and services or regulatory restrictions or compliance issues that may lead to a decrease in or cessation of sales of our products and services and have other adverse impacts on our results of operations or financial condition. For example, one of our clients (whose revenues represented approximately 1% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019) filed a voluntary petition for reorganization and the U.S. bankruptcy court approved its acquisition and assumption of certain contracts by another company. Although we currently do not expect a material impact to our financial performance as a result, the reduction in loans tracked from this client has impacted the results of our Global Housing segment. In addition, our clients and other parties with whom we do business may choose to exit lines of business that we service or may disintermediate us by developing internal capabilities, products or services that would allow them to service their clients without our involvement. In particular, the transfer by mortgage servicer clients of loan portfolios to competitors or their participation in insuring Lender-placed Insurance risks that we have historically insured could materially reduce our\nrevenues and profits from this business. Furthermore, if one or more of our clients or distributors, for example in the wireless and related markets, consolidate or align themselves with other companies with whom we do not do business, they may choose to utilize or distribute the products and services of our competitors, which could materially reduce our revenues and profits.\nSignificant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe compete for business, customers, agents and other distribution relationships with many insurance companies, financial services companies, mobile device repair and logistics companies, technology and software companies and specialized competitors that focus on one market, product or service. Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products and services than we do or be better able to tailor those products and services to customer needs, or may have greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower costs, greater financial strength, more resources or higher ratings.\nThere is a risk that purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms and offerings from competitors, vendors or other third parties, including pricing and technology. Additionally, customers may turn to our competitors as a result of our failure to deliver on customer expectations, product or service flaws, technology issues, gaps in operational support or other issues affecting customer experience. As a result, competition may adversely affect the persistency of our policies, our ability to sell products and provide services and our revenues and results of operations. For example, in our Lender-placed Insurance business, we use a proprietary insurance-tracking administration system and the development by others of competing systems or equivalent capabilities could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations.\nTo remain competitive in many of our businesses, we must anticipate and respond effectively to changes in customer preferences, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, and disruptive technology developments and alternate business models. For Global Lifestyle, in particular, the evolving nature of consumer needs and preferences and improvements in technology could result in a reduction in consumer demand and in the prices of the products and services we offer. In addition, across many of our businesses, we must respond to the threat of disruption by traditional players, such as insurers, as well as from new entrants, such as technology companies, \u201cInsurtech\u201d start-up companies and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation to simplify and improve the customer experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the markets in which we operate. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new technologies and new ways to deliver our products and services. If we do not anticipate and respond to customer preferences and disruptive changes, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to grow our business if we cannot find suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices, integrate acquired businesses effectively or identify new areas for organic growth.\nWe expect acquisitions to continue to play a role in the growth of some of our businesses. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new venture opportunities or to finance or complete such transactions on acceptable terms. Additionally, the integration of acquired businesses may result in significant challenges and additional costs, and we may be unable to accomplish such integration smoothly or successfully.\nAcquisitions may not provide us with the benefits that we anticipate, require significant effort and expenditures and entail numerous risks, difficulties and uncertainties. These include, among others, diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration of operations and infrastructure; inaccurate assessment of risks and liabilities; difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings, including the incurrence of unexpected integration costs; difficulties in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; exposure to jurisdictions or businesses with heightened legal and regulatory risks, including corruption; difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including cybersecurity and other technology systems and compliance; difficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures; failure to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows, business opportunities and growth prospects; an increase in our indebtedness or future borrowing costs; and limitations on our ability to access additional capital when needed. Our failure to adequately address these and other acquisition risks, difficulties and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market price of our stock may decline if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, if the integration takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, or if the effect of the business combination on the financial results of the combined company is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors.\nOur ability to effectively identify and capitalize on opportunities for organic growth depends on, among other things, our ability to: deliver on customer expectations and provide a positive customer experience; successfully execute large-scale, critical programs and projects in a timely and cost-effective manner; identify and successfully enter and market our services in new geographic markets and market segments; recruit and retain qualified personnel; coordinate our efforts across various geographic markets and market segments; maintain and grow relationships with our existing customers and expand our\ncustomer base; offer new products and services; form strategic alliances and partnerships; secure key vendor and distributor relationships; and access sufficient capital. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing on our organic growth initiatives or that those initiatives will provide us with the expected benefits. Our failure to effectively identify and capitalize on opportunities for organic growth could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral economic, financial market and political conditions and conditions in the markets in which we operate may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral economic, financial market and political conditions and conditions in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Limited availability of credit, deteriorations of the global mortgage and real estate markets, declines in consumer confidence and consumer spending, increases in prices or in the rate of inflation, periods of high unemployment, persistently low or rapidly increasing interest rates, disruptive geopolitical events and other events outside of our control, such as a major epidemic or a pandemic, could contribute to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets, including the market for our stock. These conditions could adversely affect all of our business segments. Specifically, during periods of economic downturn:\n\u2022\nindividuals and businesses may (i) choose not to purchase our insurance products, warranties and other products and services, (ii) terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse and (iii) choose to reduce the amount of coverage they purchase;\n\u2022\nconditions in the markets in which we operate may deteriorate, impacting, among other things, consumer demand for the electronics, appliances, automobiles, housing and other products we insure, including the rate of introduction and success of new products, technologies and promotional programs that provide opportunities for growth;\n\u2022\nclients are more likely to underperform expectations, experience financial distress, declare bankruptcy or liquidate, which could have an adverse impact on the remittance of premiums from such clients and the collection of receivables from such clients for items such as unearned premiums and could otherwise expose us to credit risk;\n\u2022\nclaims on certain specialized insurance products tend to rise;\n\u2022\nthere is a higher loss ratio on credit card and installment loan insurance due to rising unemployment and disability levels;\n\u2022\nthere is an increased risk of fraudulent insurance claims; and\n\u2022\nsubstantial decreases in loan availability and origination could reduce the demand for credit insurance that we write or debt cancellation or debt deferment products that we administer, and on the placement of hazard insurance under our Lender-placed Insurance programs.\nGeneral inflationary pressures may affect repair and replacement costs on our real and personal property lines, increasing the costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures may also affect the costs associated with our preneed insurance policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to grow with the CPI. Conversely, deflationary pressures may affect the pricing of our products and services.\nWe face risks associated with our international operations.\nOur international operations face economic, political, legal, compliance, regulatory, operational and other risks. For example, we face the risk of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds; burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and the associated risk and costs of non-compliance; exposure to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, which may result in unpredictable or inconsistent application of laws and regulations; exposure to commercial, political, legal or regulatory corruption; political, economic or other instability in countries in which we conduct business, including possible terrorist acts; the imposition of tariffs, trade barriers or other protectionist laws or business practices that favor local competition, increase costs and adversely affect our business; inflation and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; diminished ability to enforce our contractual rights; potential increased risk of data breaches; differences in cultural environments; changes in regulatory requirements, including changes in regulatory treatment of certain products or services; exposure to local economic conditions and its impact on our clients\u2019 performance and creditworthiness; and restrictions on the repatriation of non-U.S. investments and earnings.\nIf our business model is not successful in a particular country or region, or a country or region in which we do business experiences economic, political or other instability, we may lose all or part of our investment in that country or region. As we continue to expand in select worldwide markets, our business becomes increasingly exposed to these and other risks, in particular where certain countries or regions have recently experienced economic or political instability, such as in Argentina, Brazil, South Korea and the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d). For information on the U.K. and Brexit (as defined hereafter), see \u201c - The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the region.\u201d\nAs we engage with international clients, we may make certain up-front commission payments or similar cash outlays, which we may not recover if the business does not develop as we expect. These up-front payments are typically supported by various protections, such as letters of credit, letters of guarantee and real estate, but we may not fully or timely recover amounts owed to us as a result of difficulties in enforcing contracts or judgments in undeveloped or evolving legal systems and other factors. As our international business grows, we rely increasingly on fronting carriers or intermediaries in certain countries to maintain their licenses and product approvals, satisfy local regulatory requirements and continue in business. If they fail to do so, our business, reputation and relationships with our customers could be adversely affected.\nFor additional information on the significant international regulations that apply to us, including data protection regulations, and the risks relating thereto, see \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulation - International Regulation\u201d in this Report, \u201c - Legal and Regulatory Risks - We are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business, and violations or alleged violations of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations\u201d, \u201c - Legal and Regulatory Risks - Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions\u201d and \u201c - Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks - The costs of complying with, or our failure to comply with, U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and reputation\u201d.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the region.\nWe currently conduct business in Europe through our U.K. insurance subsidiaries. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d), referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d occurred on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the withdrawal, we expect to be able to continue to use our U.K. insurers to conduct business in Europe until the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. We are in the process of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for insurance subsidiaries in the Netherlands. There can be no assurance that we will receive them in time for us to transition our business in the E.U. by the conclusion of the transition period.\nIf we are unable to write new business and service our current business in Europe following the end of the transition period, either directly or through other arrangements, our European business may be adversely affected due to, among other things, financial exposure to client losses, increased cost of doing business and reputational damage. Additionally, post-transition period changes to the E.U. and U.K. legal, trade and regulatory frameworks could increase our compliance costs, subject us to operational challenges in the region and negatively impact the region\u2019s economic conditions, financial markets and exchange rates, each of which may have a negative impact on our business.\nCatastrophe and non-catastrophe losses, including as a result of climate change, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance operations expose us to claims arising from catastrophes and non-catastrophes, particularly in our homeowners insurance businesses. Catastrophes include reportable catastrophe losses, which are individual catastrophe events that generated losses in excess of $5.0 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. Non-catastrophe losses include losses from weather, fire, water damage, theft and vandalism, as well as general liability in commercial liability, renters and car-sharing insurance policies, among others.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses that materially reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes can be man-made, including terrorist attacks and accidents, or can be caused by various natural events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, floods, severe winter weather, fires and epidemics.\nNatural catastrophe trends are changing due to climate change, a phenomenon linked to rising global temperatures and resulting in changes in weather patterns. While the exact impact of the physical effects of climate change is uncertain, changes in the global climate may cause long-term increases in the frequency and severity of weather events, particularly in coastal areas, and result in increased claims and higher catastrophe losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also cannot predict how legal, regulatory and social responses to concerns around climate change may impact our business. While the frequency and severity of both man-made and natural catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property, the geographic concentration of insured lives and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from future catastrophes. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions following major catastrophes could expand insurance coverage for catastrophe claims or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nCatastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed our expectations. We use catastrophe modeling tools that help estimate our probable losses, but these projections are based on historical data and other assumptions, including with respect to climate change and seasonal weather variations, that may differ materially from actual events. If the severity of an event were sufficiently high, our losses could exceed our reinsurance coverage limits and could have a material adverse effect\non our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, claims from catastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations and financial condition for any particular fiscal quarter or year.\nAccounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for catastrophic events before they occur. Once a catastrophic event occurs, the establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital.\nBecause Global Housing\u2019s lender-placed homeowners and lender-placed manufactured housing insurance products are designed to automatically provide property coverage for client portfolios, our exposure to certain catastrophe-prone locations, such as Florida, California, Texas, New York and Puerto Rico, may increase. The withdrawal of other insurers from these or other states may lead to adverse selection and increased use of our products in these areas and may negatively affect our loss experience.\nIn addition, with respect to our preneed insurance policies, the average age of our policyholders was approximately 73 years as of December 31, 2019. Elderly individuals are generally more susceptible to certain epidemics than the overall population, and an epidemic resulting in a higher incidence of mortality could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to successfully recover should we experience a business continuity event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber-attack, power loss, computer, telecommunication or other systems failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue operations will depend on an effective disaster recovery plan and system, including the continued availability of our personnel and office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other systems and operations. We have from time to time experienced business continuity events, including events that impacted the availability of our systems. Although these events have resulted in operational challenges, to date, they have not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \u201c - Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks - The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information technology systems and infrastructure and integrate those of acquired businesses could adversely affect our business.\u201d\nOur operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage and interruption. If a business continuity event occurs, we could lose Company, customer, vendor and other third-party data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of products and services to our customers, which has occurred from time to time and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A cyber-attack or other business continuity event affecting us or key third parties with whom we work could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. An extended outage could result in the loss of premium income, fee income and clients, reputational damage, substantial volatility in our financial results and a decline in our revenues. See \u201c - Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks - We could incur significant liability if our information systems or those of third parties are breached or we or third parties otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our respective systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\u201d\nThe risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas, including major metropolitan centers, such as New York City, where our corporate offices are located, and certain catastrophe-prone areas, such as Miami, Florida, where we have significant operations. This risk is also heightened in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to higher potential threat of terrorist attacks, military conflicts, political instability and data breaches.\nA disaster or other business continuity event on a significant scale or affecting our key businesses or our data center, or our inability to successfully recover from such an event and any legislative and regulatory responses thereto, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, loss of customers or damaged customer relationships, legal liability and other adverse consequences. Our liability insurance policies may not fully cover, in type or amount, the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption.\nWe face risks associated with joint ventures, franchises and investments in which we share ownership or management with third parties.\nFrom time to time, we have and may continue to enter into joint ventures and franchises and invest in entities in which we share ownership or management with third parties. In certain circumstances, we may not have complete control over governance, financial reporting, operations, legal and regulatory compliance or other matters relating to such joint ventures, franchises or entities. As a result, we may face certain operating, financial, legal and regulatory compliance and other risks relating to these joint ventures, franchises and entities, including risks related to the financial strength of joint venture partners, franchisees and other investors; the willingness of joint venture partners, franchisees and other investors to provide adequate\nfunding for the joint venture, franchise or entity; differing goals, strategies, priorities or objectives between us and joint venture partners, franchisees or other investors; our inability to unilaterally implement actions, policies or procedures with respect to the joint venture, franchise or entity that we believe are favorable; legal and regulatory compliance risks relating to actions of the joint venture, franchise, entity, joint venture partners, franchisees or other investors; the risk that the actions of joint venture partners, franchisees and other investors could damage our brand image and reputation; and the risk that we will be unable to resolve disputes with joint venture partners, franchisees or other investors. As a result, joint ventures, franchises and investments in which we share ownership or management subject us to risk and may contribute significantly less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flows.\nSales of our products and services may decline if we are unable to develop and maintain distribution sources or attract and retain sales representatives and executives with key client relationships.\nWe distribute many of our insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels, including mobile carriers, financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, funeral homes, association groups, other third-party marketing organizations and, to a limited extent, our own captives and affiliated agents. Our relationships with these distributors are significant for our revenues and profits. There is intense competition for distribution outlets. Agents who distribute our products are typically not exclusively dedicated to us, but also market the products of our competitors. In some cases, such agents may be affiliated with other insurers who may choose to write the product that such agents are now selling on our behalf. Therefore, we face continued competition from competing products and services.\nWe also have our own sales representatives. We depend in large part on our sales representatives and segment executives to develop and maintain client relationships. Our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives and executives with key client relationships could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to successfully manage vendors and other third parties could adversely affect our business.\nAs we continue to improve operating efficiencies, we rely on vendors and other third parties, including independent contractors, to conduct business and provide services to our clients. For example, we use vendors and other third parties for business, information technology, call centers, facilities management and other services. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of vendors and other third parties, including in our agreements with such parties, but our oversight controls could prove inadequate. Since we do not fully control the actions of vendors and other third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations adversely impact us and replacing them could create significant delay and expense. If these vendors or other third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements in a high-quality and timely manner, our operations and reputation could be compromised, we may not realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from these arrangements and we could suffer adverse legal, regulatory and financial consequences. In addition, these third parties face their own technology, operating, business and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee or Company information or failure to comply with applicable law, could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients or employees, damage to our reputation and harm to our business. If we are unable to attract and retain relationships with qualified vendors, independent contractors and other third-party service providers, or if changes in law or judicial decisions require independent contractors to be classified as employees, our business could be significantly adversely affected.\nTo the extent we engage international vendors or third parties to provide services or carry out business functions, we are also exposed to the risks that accompany operations in a foreign jurisdiction, including international economic and political conditions, foreign laws and regulations, fluctuations in currency values and, potentially, increased risk of data breaches. For more information on the risks associated with the use of international vendors and third parties, see \u201c - We face risks associated with our international operations.\u201d\nOur mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value of mobile devices in our inventory, to the risk of guaranteed buybacks, and to export compliance and other risks.\nThe value of the mobile devices that we collect and refurbish for our clients may fall below the prices we have paid or guaranteed, which could adversely affect our profitability. In our mobile business, we carry inventory to meet the delivery requirements of certain clients and we provide the guaranteed buyback of devices as part of our trade-in and upgrade offerings. These devices are ultimately disposed of through sales to third parties. Our mobile business is subject to the risk that the value of devices and parts will be adversely affected by price reductions, technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the devices and parts, physical problems resulting from faulty design or manufacturing, increased competition and growing industry emphasis on cost containment. The value of devices may also be impacted by any adverse trade relationship between the U.S. and China, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government relations, tariffs and\nother trade restrictions. If the value of devices or parts is significantly reduced, it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur sales of mobile devices to third parties, particularly those domiciled outside of the U.S., subject us to compliance risks relating to export control laws and regulations. Furthermore, third parties to whom we sell mobile devices may violate such laws and regulations, which could subject us to liability. Non-compliance with such laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the risks relating to our international operations, see \u201c - We face risks associated with our international operations.\u201d\nOur products and services and the markets in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively affect our financial results.\nWe communicate with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers. There may be a perception that some of these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection. Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocacy groups and the media may focus their attention on our products and services, which may subject us to negative publicity. We may also be negatively affected if another company in one of our industries or in a related industry engages in practices that subject our industry or businesses to negative publicity. Negative publicity may also result from judicial inquiries, unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits, social media, regulatory or governmental actions with respect to our products or services and industry commercial practices.\nNegative publicity may cause increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation or enforcement action by civil and criminal authorities. Additionally, negative publicity may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, constraining our ability to price our products appropriately for the risks we are assuming, requiring us to change the products and services we offer or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate.\nThe success of our business depends on the implementation of our strategy and the continuing service of key executives, senior management and other highly-skilled personnel.\nAs part of our strategy, we are seeking to increase efficiencies and achieve cost savings while investing in technology and capabilities to support growth. We will continue to incur costs related to, among other things, investments in large-scale, critical programs, particularly in information technology systems and infrastructure, as well as costs associated with businesses in runoff or that have been sold. Our long-term strategy depends on successful operational execution, supported by the transformation of our information technology systems and infrastructure and combined with our ability to achieve efficiencies and attract and retain personnel.\nWe rely on the continued service of key executives, senior management and other highly-skilled personnel throughout our business. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain highly-skilled personnel. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on the Company, the effectiveness of our compensation programs and competition. If we do not succeed in attracting, retaining and motivating key personnel, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for and successfully carry out the succession of our key executives and senior management.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur ability to attract and retain employees and clients depends upon our corporate culture. Our employees are the cornerstone of our culture and acts of misconduct by any employee, and particularly by senior management, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation. Our employees could engage or be accused of engaging in misconduct that subjects us to litigation, regulatory sanctions, financial costs and serious harm to our reputation or financial position. Employee misconduct could also prompt regulators to allege or determine, on the basis of such misconduct, that we have not established an adequate program to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective. Misconduct by employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, reputation and business.\nOur common stock may be subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.\nOur common stock price could materially fluctuate or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including: quarterly variations in our operating results; catastrophe losses; operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; changes in our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 financial strength ratings; changes in our corporate debt ratings; limitations on premium levels or the ability to maintain or raise premiums on existing policies; regulatory developments; and negative\npublicity relating to us or our competitors. In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the trading price or volume of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nApplicable laws, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and contract provisions may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nApplicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. For example, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors, which could delay, defer or prevent a change in control. Such provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nAdditionally, applicable state and foreign insurance laws may require prior approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer. State statutes generally provide, and certain foreign statutes provide, that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist when any person directly or indirectly owns, controls, has voting power over, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the domestic insurer\u2019s voting securities. Prior to granting such approval, a state insurance commissioner will typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicant\u2019s board of directors and executive officers, the applicant\u2019s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control.\nOur certificate of incorporation or by-laws also contain provisions that permit the Board to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on the Board, prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent and impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings.\nFinancial Risks\nOur actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital.\nWe maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported claims and incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims as of the end of each accounting period. Whether calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), Statutory Accounting Principles or accounting principles applicable in foreign jurisdictions, reserves are estimates. Reserving is inherently a matter of judgment and our ultimate liabilities could exceed reserves for a variety of reasons, including changes in macroeconomic factors (such as unemployment and interest rates), case development and other factors. From time to time, we also adjust our reserves, and may adjust our reserving methodology, as these factors, our claims experience and estimates of future trends in claims frequency and severity change. Reserve development, changes in our reserving methodology and paid losses exceeding corresponding reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Reserves\u201d in this Report for additional detail on our reserves.\nWe may be unable to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur profitability could be reduced if we are unable to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, including the frequency and severity of property and other claims. This ability could be affected by factors including inflation, changes in the regulatory environment, changes in industry practices, changes in legal, social or environmental conditions or new technologies. Political or economic conditions can also affect the availability of programs on which our business may rely to accurately predict claims and other costs. The inability to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFor Global Housing, our lender-placed products are not underwritten on an individual policy basis and our contracts with clients require us to issue these policies automatically when a borrower\u2019s insurance coverage is not maintained. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our pricing does not accurately account for the additional risk we assume from ensuring that all client properties are provided continuous insurance coverage rather than underwriting on individual policies.\nA decline in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRatings are important considerations in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. A.M. Best rates most of our domestic and significant international operating insurance subsidiaries. Moody\u2019s rates four of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries and S&P rates five of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moody\u2019s and S&P, and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain them. Rating agencies may change their methodology or requirements for determining ratings, or they may become more conservative in assigning ratings. Rating agencies or regulators could also increase capital requirements for our subsidiaries. Any reduction in these ratings could materially adversely affect our standing in the insurance industry and the demand for our products from intermediaries and consumers, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our operations had a significant number of contracts that contain provisions that require the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum financial strength ratings, typically from A.M. Best, ranging from \u201cA\u201d or better to \u201cB+\u201d or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts or fail to renew them if the subsidiaries\u2019 ratings fall below these minimums. Termination of or failure to renew these agreements could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA credit rating agency downgrade of our corporate senior debt rating could have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nCurrently, Assurant, Inc.\u2019s senior debt is rated BBB by S&P and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s. The ratings from both S&P and Moody\u2019s currently carry a stable outlook.\nIf our senior debt credit ratings were downgraded below investment grade, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and perceptions of our financial strength, could be adversely affected. In particular, a downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities and increase the expense and difficulty of financing our operations. For example, the interest rate payable on each of the 2021 Senior Notes, the 2023 Senior Notes, the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2030 Senior Notes (each as defined hereafter) is subject to increase if either of Moody\u2019s or S&P downgrades the credit rating assigned to such series of senior notes to Ba1 or below or to BB+ or below, respectively. Additionally, we could be subject to more restrictive financial and operational covenants in any indebtedness we issue in the future, which could reduce our operational flexibility. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded further. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on the 2021 Senior Notes, the 2023 Senior Notes, the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2030 Senior Notes, and the impact of rating changes.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and other foreign currencies may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile most of our costs and revenues are in U.S. Dollars, some are in other currencies. Because our financial results in certain countries are translated from local currency into U.S. Dollars upon consolidation, our results of operations have been and may continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. To a large extent, we do not currently hedge foreign currency risk. If the U.S. Dollar weakens against a local currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income. Similarly, our net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income will decrease if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against a local currency. These fluctuations in currency exchange rates may result in losses that materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we may incur foreign exchange losses in connection with the designation of the U.S. Dollar as the functional currency of our international subsidiaries. For example, management has classified Argentina\u2019s economy as highly inflationary in accordance with GAAP accounting requirements and, as a result, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiaries was changed from the local currency to U.S. Dollars and their non-U.S. Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities were subject to remeasurement resulting in losses. We could incur additional losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations. For additional information on the change in functional currency for our Argentina subsidiaries and the effect thereof, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nAn impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and book value.\nAs a result of the TWG acquisition, we added a considerable amount of goodwill and other intangible assets to our balance sheet. Goodwill represented 41% of our total equity as of December 31, 2019. We review our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in our expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. In addition, other intangible assets collectively represented 10% of our total equity as of December 31, 2019. Estimated useful lives of finite intangible assets are reassessed on an annual basis. Generally, other intangible assets with finite lives are only tested for impairment if there are indicators of impairment identified, including\na significant adverse change in the extent, manner or length of time in which the other intangible asset is being used or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the other intangible asset. We recognized an impairment of certain intangible assets of $20.8 million in 2018 and $15.6 million in 2019 associated with the acquisition of Green Tree Insurance Agency. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or significant reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and book value. For more information on our annual goodwill impairment testing, the goodwill of our segments and related reporting units and intangible asset impairment testing, see \u201cItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill\u201d and Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. While management has certified that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019, because internal control over financial reporting is complex, there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future. We also rely on manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error and internal control failure compared to automated processes. Any failure to implement required controls, or difficulties or errors encountered in their operation, could adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm would be unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or opine that our financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. Internal control deficiencies may also prevent us from reporting our financial information on a timely basis or cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to litigation and adverse regulatory consequences, including fines and other sanctions. If any of the foregoing were to occur, investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements could erode, resulting in a decline in our stock price, impairing our ability to raise capital, negatively affecting our reputation and subjecting us to legal and regulatory risk.\nUnfavorable conditions in the capital and credit markets may significantly and adversely affect our access to capital and our ability to pay our debts or expenses.\nThe global capital and credit markets have experienced periods of uncertainty, volatility and disruption, including due to changes to U.S. and foreign tax and trade policies, imposition of new or increased tariffs, other trade restrictions, other government actions, foreign currency fluctuations and other factors. Our ability to raise money during such periods could be severely or entirely restricted. Our ability to borrow or raise money is important if our operating cash flow is insufficient to pay our expenses, meet capital requirements, repay debt, pay dividends on our common and preferred stock or make investments. The principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums, fee income, cash flow from our investment portfolio, the Credit Facility (as defined below) and liquid assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short-and long-term instruments. If our access to the capital and credit markets is restricted, our cost of capital could increase, thus decreasing our profitability and reducing our financial flexibility, including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar or more favorable terms. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially and adversely affected by periods of uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the capital or credit markets.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market risk, including changes in interest rates, that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nInvestment returns are an important part of our profitability. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, including in the fixed maturity and equity securities markets, which could impair our profitability, financial condition and cash flows. Further, in pricing our products and services, we incorporate assumptions regarding returns on our investments. Market conditions may not allow us to invest in assets with sufficiently high returns to meet our pricing assumptions and profit targets over the long term.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in our investment portfolio. Changes in interest rates may materially adversely affect the performance of some of our investments, including by materially reducing the fair value of and net investment income from fixed maturity securities and increasing unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. Fixed maturity securities represented approximately 84% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2019. The fair market value of fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income from fixed maturity securities increases or decreases directly with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. Recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates. A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at historically low levels\nmay result in lower-than-expected net investment income and larger required reserves. Though we employ asset/liability management strategies to manage the adverse effects of interest rate changes, significant fluctuations in the level of interest rates may require us to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to pay claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk\u201d in this Report.\nIn addition, extended periods of declining interest rates or rising inflation may cause compression in the spread between the death benefit growth rates on our preneed insurance policies and the investment income that we can earn, resulting in a negative spread, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. See \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Inflation Risk\u201d in this Report.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds, preferred stocks, leveraged loans, municipal bonds and commercial mortgages. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income or result in realized investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by downgrades in the corporate bonds included in our portfolio, increases in treasury rates or credit spreads and by other factors that may result in realized and unrealized investment losses and other-than-temporary impairments. The determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary impairment requires the judgment of management and there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in facts, circumstances or critical assumptions could cause management to conclude that further impairments have occurred, which could lead to additional losses on investments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio. For further details on net investment losses and other-than-temporary-impairments, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nThe value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of its issuer. As of December 31, 2019, fixed maturity securities represented approximately 84% and below investment grade securities (rated \u201cBB\u201d or lower by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) represented approximately 4% of the fair value of our total investments. Below investment grade securities generally are expected to provide higher returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Credit Risk\u201d in this Report for additional information on the composition of our fixed maturity securities portfolio.\nEquity securities represented approximately 3% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2019. However, we have had higher percentages of equity securities in the past and may make more equity investments in the future. Investments in equity securities generally are expected to provide higher total returns but present greater risk to preservation of capital than our fixed maturity securities. Beginning January 1, 2018, we were required to reflect all changes in the fair value of equity securities through our statements of comprehensive income, which may increase the volatility of our financial results. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for more information.\nOur investments in commercial mortgage loans on real estate (which represented approximately 6% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2019) are relatively illiquid. If we require extremely large amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices and in a timely manner.\nU.S. tax reform could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, are subject to significant change and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d), which significantly amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, was enacted. Compliance with the TCJA may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. The overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain due to the ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of the TCJA, the impact of future guidance, interpretations or rules issued by government agencies in applying the TCJA and potential court decisions interpreting the legislation. Future changes in U.S. tax laws, including changes in the application or interpretation of the TCJA, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn accordance with applicable income tax guidance, we must determine whether our ability to realize the value of our deferred tax asset or to recognize certain tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions is \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d Under current income tax guidance, a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance, or a liability related to uncertain tax\npositions should be accrued, if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carry-forward periods.\nIn determining the appropriate valuation allowance, management made certain judgments relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss and tax credit carry-forwards, levels of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The assumptions in making these judgments are updated periodically on the basis of current business conditions affecting us and overall economic conditions. These management judgments are therefore subject to change due to factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in our ability to realize sufficient taxable income of the same character in the same jurisdiction or in our ability to execute other tax planning strategies. Furthermore, any future changes in tax laws could impact the value of our deferred tax assets. Management will continue to assess and determine the need for, and the amount of, the valuation allowance in subsequent periods. Any change in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nReinsurance may not be adequate or available to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers.\nAs part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various operating segments. Although reinsurers are liable to us for claims properly ceded under our reinsurance arrangements, we remain liable to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Ceded reinsurance arrangements therefore do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. We are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. The inability to collect amounts due from reinsurers could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nReinsurance for certain types of catastrophes could become unavailable or prohibitively expensive for some of our businesses. In such a situation, we might also be adversely affected by state and other regulations that prohibit us from excluding catastrophe exposures or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe-prone areas.\nOur reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. Inability to obtain reinsurance at favorable rates or at all could cause us to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, take more risk, or incur higher costs. Any of these developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThrough reinsurance, we have sold or exited businesses that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the reinsurers become insolvent.\nIn the past, we have sold, and in the future we may sell, businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties. We have also exited certain businesses through reinsurance. For example, we have sold our Long-Term Care division, the insurance operations of our Fortis Financial Group division, including individual life operations and annuity business, and our Assurant Employee Benefits segment. The reinsurance recoverable relating to these dispositions was $4.46 billion as of December 31, 2019. The four reinsurers with the largest reinsurance recoverable balances relating to these dispositions were Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (\u201cSun Life\u201d), John Hancock Life Insurance Company (\u201cJohn Hancock\u201d), Talcott Resolution Life and Annuity Insurance Company (\u201cTalcott Resolution\u201d) and Employers Reassurance Corporation (\u201cERAC\u201d). The A.M. Best ratings of Sun Life, John Hancock and Talcott Resolution are currently A+, A+ and B++, respectively. A.M. Best withdrew its rating for ERAC in March 2019. Most of the assets backing reserves reinsured under these and other sales are held in trusts or separate accounts. However, if the reinsurers became insolvent, the assets in the trusts or separate accounts could prove insufficient to support the liabilities that would revert to us. In addition, there are no assets or other collateral backing reserves relating to the reinsurance recoverable from ERAC.\nWe also face the risk of again becoming responsible for administering these businesses in the event of reinsurer insolvency. We do not currently have the administrative systems and capabilities to process these businesses. Accordingly, we would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers. We might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, other third parties to whom we have sold businesses in the past may in turn sell these businesses to other third parties, through reinsurance or otherwise, and we could face credit risks and risks related to the new administrative systems and capabilities of these third parties in administering these businesses.\nFor more information on these arrangements, including the reinsurance recoverables and risk mitigation mechanisms used, see \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks - Credit Risk\u201d in this Report.\nDue to the structure of our commission program, we are exposed to risks related to the creditworthiness and reporting systems of some of our agents, third-party administrators and clients.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of some of the agents, third-party administrators and clients with which we contract in our businesses. For example, we advance agents\u2019 commissions as part of our preneed insurance offerings. These advances are a\npercentage of the total face amount of coverage. There is a one-year payback provision against the agency if death or lapse occurs within the first policy year. If SCI, which receives the largest share of such agent commissions, were unable to fulfill its payback obligations, this could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our agents, third-party administrators and clients collect and report premiums or pay claims on our behalf. These parties\u2019 failure to remit all premiums collected or to pay claims on our behalf on a timely and accurate basis could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 inability to pay us sufficient dividends could prevent us from meeting our obligations and paying future stockholder dividends.\nAs a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, to repurchase shares or debt, to acquire new businesses and to pay dividends to common and preferred stockholders and corporate expenses. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends and to make such other payments depends on their GAAP equity or statutory surplus, future earnings, cash position, rating agency requirements and regulatory restrictions, as applicable. Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including policyholders, have priority over our claims with respect to our subsidiaries\u2019 assets and earnings. If any of our subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against our subsidiaries\u2019 assets or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of our subsidiaries under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary and the insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary.\nThe payment of dividends by any of our regulated domestic insurance company subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary\u2019s domiciliary jurisdiction department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by jurisdiction. The formula for the majority of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is based on the prior year\u2019s statutory net income or 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year. Some jurisdictions have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, they may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. Future regulatory actions could further restrict our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay us dividends. For more information on the maximum amount of dividends our regulated U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us in 2020 under applicable laws and regulations, without prior regulatory approval, see \u201cItem 5 - Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividend Policy.\u201d\nAny additional material restrictions on our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay us dividends could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our common and preferred stock, service our debt and pay other corporate expenses.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase shares may be limited.\nOur declaration and payment of dividends on our common and preferred stock in the future will be determined by the Board in its sole discretion and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, other uses of cash, funding requirements, applicable law and other factors the Board deems relevant. The payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to the preferential rights of our 6.50% Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value of $1.00 per share (the \u201cMCPS\u201d), and other preferred stock that the Board may create from time to time. The Credit Facility also contains limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders if we are in default, or such dividend payments would cause us to be in default, of our obligations thereunder. In addition, if we defer the payment of interest on our Subordinated Notes (as defined hereafter), we generally may not make payments on our capital stock. Furthermore, the agreements governing any of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 future indebtedness may limit our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common and preferred stock. In the event that any agreements governing any such indebtedness restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends in cash on our common and preferred stock, we may be unable to declare and pay dividends in cash on our common or preferred stock unless we can repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under such agreements.\nNo common stock may be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the MCPS for all preceding dividend periods have been declared and paid in full, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, at any time when we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments on the Subordinated Notes, we generally may not repurchase any shares of our capital stock, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the method for determining LIBOR or the replacement of LIBOR.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021, which is expected to result in LIBOR rates no longer being available. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The calculation of interest on any of our LIBOR-linked instruments, including our Credit Facility if drawn, based on an alternative rate may result in a higher interest expense and may adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. In addition, uncertainty regarding potential changes to LIBOR until 2021, the establishment of SOFR or an alternative reference rate as the primary reference for setting interest rates on loans globally, and other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, including those held in our investment portfolio.\nTechnology, Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks\nThe failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information technology systems and infrastructure and integrate those of acquired businesses could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to maintain effective, secure and reliable information technology systems and infrastructure and to modernize them to support current and new clients and grow in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We are undergoing a multi-year transformation of our information technology systems and infrastructure, including enhancing existing systems and developing new systems and products, to support our strategy and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and evolving industry and regulatory requirements. We are also updating certain operations and financial systems, procedures and controls. However, we currently rely on manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error and internal control failure compared to automated processes. We must integrate the systems of acquired businesses effectively so that technology gained through acquisitions meets the required level of security and performance capabilities to avoid additional risk to existing operations.\nOur ability to modernize our information technology systems and infrastructure requires us to execute large-scale, complex programs and projects, which rely on the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources and effective planning and management processes. We may be unable to implement these programs and projects effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner, which could result in poor customer experience, cost overruns, additional expenses, reputational harm, legal and regulatory actions and other adverse consequences.\nIf we are unable to maintain information technology systems, procedures (including technology continuity planning and recovery testing) and controls that function effectively without interruption and securely (including through a failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete hardware, applications or software systems) or to update or integrate our systems, we may not be able to successfully offer our products, grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner and our relationships with clients could be adversely affected. We have from time to time experienced failures that result in the unavailability of information technology systems upon which our clients rely. Such failures could result in loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For risks relating to the security of our information technology systems and cyber-attacks, see \u201c - We could incur significant liability if our information systems or those of third parties are breached or we or third parties otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our respective systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\u201d\nWe could incur significant liability if our information systems or those of third parties are breached or we or third parties otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our respective systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on the uninterrupted and secure operation of our information technology systems to operate our business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information. This electronic information includes confidential and other sensitive information, including personal data, that we receive from our customers, vendors and other third parties. In the normal course of business, we also share confidential and other sensitive information with our vendors and other third parties with whom we work. Our information technology systems and safety control systems and those of our vendors and other third parties are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of external threats, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malware, ransomware and other types of data and systems related events. Our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees and third parties who may have otherwise legitimate access to our systems. Our call centers subject us to additional risk from internal threats due to access to personal information. Moreover, we face the ongoing challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment. The latency of a compromise is often measured in months but could be years, and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner. We could experience significant financial and reputational harm if our information systems are breached, sensitive client or Company data are compromised, surreptitiously modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public, or if we fail to make adequate disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations, organized crime, hackers and \u201chacktivists\u201d (activist hackers), through use\nof increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including long-term, persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats or attacks via yet unknown vulnerabilities referred to as zero-day threats. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, resulting in potential data loss or other damage to information technology systems. As the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use continue to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile devices, cloud services, social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the Internet, the potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks also increases.\nOur data protection measures may not be effective to protect our network and systems from such threats. Should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user or otherwise, we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data. Certain measures that could increase the security of our systems take significant time and resources to deploy broadly and may not be effective against an attack. Additionally, our policies, procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential, personal or proprietary information and other cybersecurity incidents, assess the severity or impact of any such incidents or appropriately respond in a timely manner. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade effective protective measures and other safeguards or adequately respond to a breach could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTo safeguard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities, we continue to invest in the development of software in accordance with best practices. In addition, our information systems must be continually patched and upgraded to protect against vulnerabilities. As the volume of new software vulnerabilities continues to increase, as has the criticality of patches and other remedial measures. Accordingly, we are at risk that cyber attackers exploit these vulnerabilities before they have been addressed. Due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate and the increased frequency at which vendors issue security patches to their products, the need to test patches and, in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors, before they can be deployed, we are at risk that we cannot deploy in a timely and effective manner. We are also dependent on vendors and other third parties, such as cloud service providers, to keep their systems patched in order to protect our data. Any failure related to these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have vendors and other third parties who receive data from us in connection with the services we offer our customers. In addition, we have migrated certain data, and may increasingly migrate data, to the cloud hosted by third-party providers. We are at risk of a cyber-attack involving a vendor or other third party, which could result in a breakdown of such third party\u2019s data protection measures or access to our infrastructure through the third party. To the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a cyber-attack that compromises their operations, our data and our customers\u2019 data could be compromised or we may experience possible service interruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk. For instance, we may not adequately identify weaknesses in an acquired entity\u2019s information systems, either before or after the acquisition, which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition, expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyber-attack. We may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner, which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place.\nWe have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as malware incursions, employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error, such as loss of portable and other data storage devices. Like many companies, we are subject to regular phishing email and social media engineering campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections and financial and data losses. Although these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages, to date, they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations. In the future, these types of incidents could result in confidential, personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen, surreptitiously modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time, or maliciously made public, including client, employee or company data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nImproper access to or disclosure of sensitive client or Company information could harm our reputation and subject us to significant liability under our contracts, as well as under existing or future laws, rules and regulations. In the event of a cyber-attack, we might have to take our systems offline, which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation. We also may be unable to detect an incident, assess its severity or impact, or appropriately respond and recover any financial and data loss in a timely manner. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to mitigate the damage and to protect against future damage. In addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related data and system incidents.\nThe costs of complying with, or our failure to comply with, U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and reputation.\nIn providing services and solutions to our customers and operating our business, we process, store and transfer sensitive customer, end-consumer and Company data, including personal data, in and across multiple jurisdictions. As a result, we are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data\nsecurity. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of the European Commission\u2019s laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, such as the public disclosure of significant data breaches, privacy impact assessments, data portability and the appointment of data protection officers. Additionally, in August 2018, Brazil passed its first privacy law, which is modeled after GDPR. At the state level, the New York State Department of Financial Services has issued cybersecurity regulations that impose an array of detailed security measures on covered entities and California passed a comprehensive privacy act that increases California residents\u2019 privacy rights in a manner similar to GDPR. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time and may restrict the way services involving data are offered, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations. Complying with these and similar laws and regulations also requires us to make significant changes to our operations, which rely on the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources and effective planning and management processes. We may be unable to implement required operational changes effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner, which could result in cost overruns, additional expenses, reputational harm, legal and regulatory actions and other adverse consequences.\nUnauthorized disclosure or transfer of personal or otherwise sensitive data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, misappropriation or other means, by us, our vendors or other parties with whom we do business could subject us to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution and other adverse consequences in one or more jurisdictions. Such events could also result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation and cause us to lose clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business, and violations or alleged violations of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the U.S. and its various states and territories, the E.U. and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, we are subject to regulation by state and territory insurance regulators in the U.S., by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. and agencies such as the SEC, both in our capacity as a publicly-traded company and through our registered investment adviser subsidiary. We are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, trade sanctions, export control regulations and restrictions and anti-money laundering laws. We are subject to other laws and regulations on matters as diverse as antitrust, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, data privacy and protection, taxation, environmental protection, wage-and-hour standards and employment and labor relations. Furthermore, our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory oversight, including: restrictions and requirements related to licensing; capital, surplus and dividends; underwriting limitations; the ability to enter, exit and continue to operate in markets, including as a result of Brexit; statutory accounting and other disclosure requirements; coverage; the ability to provide, terminate or cancel certain coverages; premium rates, including regulatory ability to disapprove or reduce the premium rates companies may charge; trade and claims practices; content of disclosures to consumers; type, amount and valuation of investments; assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and companies\u2019 ability to recover assessments through premium increases; and market conduct and sales practices.\nThe U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and may change rapidly, and our efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources and increase the costs and risks of doing business in these jurisdictions. The regulations we are subject to have become more stringent over time, may decrease the need for our services, impose significant operational limits on our business and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Further, the laws and regulations affecting our business are subject to change as a result of, among other things, new interpretations and judicial decisions, and any such changes may increase the regulatory requirements imposed on us, impact the way we are able to do business and significantly harm our business and results of operations. While we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we or our employees, consultants, contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to investigations, criminal penalties, civil remedies or other adverse consequences, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business, redress to clients, exposure to negative publicity or reputational damage and harm to client, employee and other relationships. Moreover, our failure to comply with laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may result in increased regulatory scrutiny by other regulatory agencies in that jurisdiction or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. The cost of compliance and the consequences of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional discussion of the various laws and regulations affecting our business, see \u201cItem 1 - Business -\nRegulation\u201d in this Report and \u201c - Business and Competitive Risks - The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the region.\u201d\nOur business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including:\n\u2022\nindustry-wide investigations regarding business practices, including the use and marketing of certain types of insurance policies or certificates of insurance, and compliance with guidance issued by regulators;\n\u2022\nactions by regulatory authorities that may restrict our ability to increase or maintain our premium rates, require us to reduce premium rates, impose fines or penalties and result in other expenses;\n\u2022\nmarket conduct examinations, for which we are required to pay the expenses of the regulator as well as our own expenses, and which may result in fines, penalties, and other adverse consequences;\n\u2022\ndisputes regarding our Lender-placed Insurance products, including those relating to rates, agent compensation, consumer disclosure, continuous coverage requirements, loan tracking services and other services that we provide to mortgage servicers;\n\u2022\ndisputes over coverage or claims adjudication;\n\u2022\ndisputes over our treatment of claims, in which states or insureds may allege that we failed to make required payments or meet prescribed deadlines for adjudicating claims;\n\u2022\ndisputes regarding regulatory compliance, sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, underwriting and compensation arrangements;\n\u2022\ndisputes over liability claims under comprehensive general liability policies involving property damage or personal injury at insured properties or relating to insured vehicles;\n\u2022\ndisputes alleging bundling of credit insurance and warranty products with other products provided by financial institutions;\n\u2022\ndisputes with tax and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities; and\n\u2022\ndisputes relating to customers\u2019 claims that they were not aware of the full cost or existence of the insurance or limitations on insurance coverage.\nFurther, actions by certain regulators may cause additional changes to the structure of the Lender-placed Insurance industry, including the arrangements under which we track coverage on mortgaged properties. These changes could materially adversely affect the results of operations of Global Housing and the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. For additional information, see \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulation\u201d in this Report.\nWe are involved in a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations and may from time to time become involved in other such actions. In particular, we are a defendant in class actions in a number of jurisdictions regarding our Lender-placed Insurance programs. These cases allege a variety of claims under a number of legal theories. The plaintiffs seek premium refunds and other relief. We continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these class actions and, as appropriate, enter into settlements.\nWe participate in settlements on terms that we consider reasonable; however, the results of any pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and involve significant uncertainty. Unfavorable outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings or significant problems in our relationships with regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, reputation, ratings and ability to continue to do business. They could also expose us to further investigations or litigation. In addition, certain of our clients in the mortgage, credit card and banking industries are the subject of various regulatory investigations and litigation matters regarding mortgage lending practices, credit insurance, debt-deferment and debt cancellation products, and the sale of ancillary products, which could indirectly negatively affect our businesses. For additional information, see \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nOur business is subject to risks related to reductions in the insurance premium rates we charge.\nThe premiums we charge are subject to review by regulators. If they consider our loss ratios to be too low, they could require us to reduce our rates. Significant rate reductions could materially reduce our profitability.\nLender-placed Insurance products accounted for approximately 55% of Global Housing\u2019s net earned premiums, fees and other income for both of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The corresponding contributions to segment net income\nfor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately 52% and 46%, respectively. The portion of segment net income attributable to Lender-placed Insurance products may vary substantially over time depending on the frequency, severity and location of catastrophic losses, the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and reinstatement coverage, the variability of claim processing costs and client acquisition costs, and other factors. In addition, we expect placement rates for these products to decline in 2020 as housing markets continue to improve.\nWe file rates with the state departments of insurance in the ordinary course of business. In addition to this routine correspondence, from time to time we engage in discussions and proceedings with certain state regulators regarding our Lender-placed Insurance business. The results of such reviews may vary. As previously disclosed, we have reached agreements with state insurance regulators in certain states, including New York, Florida, California, Indiana, Texas and Minnesota, regarding our Lender-placed Insurance business in those states. In addition, we completed a regulatory settlement agreement (the \u201cRSA\u201d) to resolve a targeted multistate market conduct examination sponsored by the NAIC and focused on Lender-placed Insurance, which includes a number of requirements and restrictions that are applicable in all participating states and U.S. territories. Among other things, the terms of the RSA require more frequent rate filings for Lender-placed Insurance. This could result in downward pressure on premium rates for these products. If such filings result in significant decreases in premium rates for our Lender-placed Insurance products, our cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nLegislation or other regulatory reform related to the insurance industry that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations. Various state and federal regulatory authorities have also taken actions with respect to our Lender-placed Insurance business, including the multistate market conduct examination and related RSA. If we were unable for any reason to comply with any new or revised requirements, including the RSA, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, new interpretations of existing laws or new judicial decisions affecting the insurance industry could adversely affect our business.\nInsurance industry-related legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm our subsidiaries and us include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nimposed reductions in premium rates, limitations on the ability to raise premiums on existing policies, or new minimum loss ratios;\n\u2022\nincreases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements;\n\u2022\nenhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future financial crises or to otherwise ensure the stability of institutions;\n\u2022\nnew licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability to offer certain types of insurance products or service contracts;\n\u2022\nprohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk-sharing arrangements;\n\u2022\nmore stringent standards of review for claims denials or coverage determinations;\n\u2022\nincreased regulation relating to Lender-placed Insurance;\n\u2022\nnew or enhanced regulatory requirements that require insurers to pay claims on terms other than those mandated by underlying policy contracts; and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the solicitation of insurance consumers by funeral board laws for prefunded funeral insurance coverage.\nIn addition, regulators in certain states have hired third-party auditors to audit the unclaimed property records of insurance companies operating in those states. Among other companies, we are currently subject to these audits in a number of states and have been responding to information requests from these auditors.\nSeveral proposals have been adopted or are currently pending to amend state insurance holding company and other laws that increase the scope of insurance company regulation globally. The NAIC has implemented the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment, which requires U.S. insurers and insurance groups to perform an annual assessment, and Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure reporting, which requires U.S. insurers and insurance groups to report on their governance structure, policies and practices. Regulatory bodies are expected to increase the frequency of discussions between each other and the level of data sharing across borders in order to enable more consistent regulation of global companies.", "PERMNO": 90038, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "AIZ"}
