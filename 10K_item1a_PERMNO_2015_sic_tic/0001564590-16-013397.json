{"cik": "1418819", "company": "Iridium Communications Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business plan depends on increased demand for mobile satellite services, among other factors.\nOur business plan is predicated on growth in demand for mobile satellite services. Demand for mobile satellite services may not grow, or may even contract, either generally or in particular geographic markets, for particular types of services or during particular time periods. A lack of demand could impair our ability to sell products and services, develop and successfully market new products and services and could exert downward pressure on prices. Any decline in prices would decrease our revenue and profitability and negatively affect our ability to generate cash for capital expenditures, investments and other working capital needs.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan will also depend on a number of other factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain the health, capacity and control of our existing satellite constellation;\n\u00b7\nour ability to complete the design, build and launch of Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure, products and services, and, once launched, our ability to maintain the health, capacity and control of the new satellite constellation;\n\u00b7\nthe level of market acceptance and demand for our products and services;\n\u00b7\nour ability to introduce innovative new products and services that satisfy market demand, including new service offerings on Iridium NEXT;\n\u00b7\nour ability to expand our business using our existing spectrum resources both in the United States and internationally;\n\u00b7\nour ability to sell our products and services in additional countries;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain our relationship with U.S. government customers, particularly the DoD;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our distributors to market and distribute our products, services and applications effectively and their continued development of innovative and improved solutions and applications for our products and services;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our competitors in developing and offering similar services and products; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain competitive prices for our products and services and to control our costs.\nOur business plan depends in large part on the success of our subsidiary, Aireon LLC, which is our primary hosted payload customer.\nIn June 2012, we announced our plans to host a payload being developed by our subsidiary, Aireon LLC, as our primary hosted payload on Iridium NEXT. We currently expect to rely on the cash flows generated from this hosted-payload arrangement with Aireon to satisfy a portion of our capital requirements for the development and deployment of Iridium NEXT. Aireon\u2019s payload will be a satellite-based automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast, or ADS-B, system for global air traffic monitoring, and Aireon\u2019s success will depend on its ability to successfully develop and manufacture this system. Deploying an ADS-B system on satellites is a new and unproven method for providing this service and will require significant technological development.\nIn addition, Aireon\u2019s ability to pay us hosting fees will depend on the development of the market for a space-based ADS-B service among air navigation service providers, or ANSPs, particularly the FAA. Aireon does not have a contract with the FAA to provide commercial, operational ADS-B services, and there can be no assurance that it will be successful in securing such a contract. The FAA\u2019s activities to date have been limited to preparing to use space-based ADS-B, and no funds have been allocated by the FAA for a commercial, operational commitment to Aireon. If Aireon is not successful in entering into a contract with the FAA for the provision of operational ADS-B services, it may not be able to make its hosting reimbursement payments to us when we currently anticipate or at all.\nAireon will itself require significant additional capital to complete the successful development, deployment and operation of its system. The Aireon LLC Agreement provides for the purchase by NAV CANADA Satellite and three other ANSP investors of additional membership interests in multiple tranches through late 2017 for an aggregate investment of up to $270 million, of which $195 million has been funded through 2015. Each tranche, however, is subject to the satisfaction of various operational, commercial, regulatory and financial conditions, some of which will be out of our control, and the investors have significant discretion in the determination of whether those conditions have been met. Further, if the FAA and other ANSPs do not contract for services on the timeline we expect, Aireon may need additional operating capital. If Aireon issues equity to raise such capital, we may experience dilution of our retained interest in Aireon.\nThe management of Aireon is not within our control given that we only have rights to appoint a minority of the members of the Aireon board of directors, as well as significant veto rights and other protective provisions provided to NAV CANADA and the other investors. As a result, we may not be able to cause Aireon to take actions that we believe are necessary for its ultimate success.\nIf Aireon is unable to pay its hosting reimbursement costs, our ability to pursue our business plan would be compromised unless we were able to replace those amounts with capital from other sources. In addition, Aireon\u2019s failure to pay our data fees and make the anticipated redemption of a portion of our equity interest would negatively affect our expected future results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital to design, build and launch Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure, products and services, and to pursue additional growth opportunities. If we fail to maintain access to sufficient capital, we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\nOur business plan calls for the development of Iridium NEXT, the development of new product and service offerings, upgrades to our current services, hardware and software upgrades to maintain our ground infrastructure and upgrades to our business systems. We estimate the costs associated with the design, build and launch of Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure upgrades through 2017 to be approximately $3 billion. Our funding plan for these costs includes the substantial majority of the funds available under our $1.8 billion Credit Facility, together with cash on hand and internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads and potential cash flows from Iridium PRIME. Our ability to continue to make draws under the Credit Facility will depend upon our satisfaction of the borrowing conditions provided for in the Credit Facility at the time of the borrowing, some of which will be outside of our control. For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Credit Facility\u201d in this report.\nThere can also be no assurance that our internally generated cash flows will meet our current expectations, or that we will not encounter increased costs. For example, Aireon may be unable to pay its hosting reimbursement costs, and the market for Iridium PRIME may not develop as we expect. If internally generated cash flows, including potential cash from Aireon or Iridium PRIME, are less than we expect, we might need to finance the remaining cost of Iridium NEXT by raising additional debt or equity financing. In addition, we may need additional capital to design and launch new products and services on Iridium NEXT. Such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or to raise additional capital for one or more of these needs, our ability to maintain our network, design, build and launch Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure, develop new products and services, and pursue additional growth opportunities will be impaired, which would significantly limit the development of our business and impair our ability to provide a commercially acceptable level of service. We may experience overall liquidity levels lower than our recent liquidity levels. Inadequate liquidity could compromise our ability to pursue our business plans and growth opportunities and make borrowings under the Credit Facility, delay the ultimate deployment of Iridium NEXT or otherwise impair our business and financial position.\nIf we fail to satisfy the ongoing borrowing conditions of the Credit Facility, we may be unable to fund Iridium NEXT.\nWe plan to use borrowings under the Credit Facility to partially fund the construction of our Iridium NEXT satellites, including borrowing to capitalize interest otherwise due under the Credit Facility. Our ability to continue to draw funds under the Credit Facility over time will depend on the satisfaction of borrowing conditions at the time of each draw, including:\n\u00b7\ncompliance with the covenants under the Credit Facility, including financial covenants and covenants relating to hosted payloads and launch and in-orbit insurance;\n\u00b7\naccuracy of the representations we make under the Credit Facility;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with the other terms of the Credit Facility, including the absence of events of default; and\n\u00b7\nmaintenance of the insurance policy with COFACE.\nSome of these borrowing conditions may be outside of our control or otherwise difficult to satisfy. If we do not continue to satisfy those and other borrowing conditions under the Credit Facility and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders, we would need to find other sources of financing. We would have to seek the permission of the lenders under the Credit Facility in order to obtain many alternative sources of financing, and there can be no assurance that we would have access to other sources of financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may require immediate repayment in full of amounts borrowed or foreclose on our assets.\nThe Credit Facility contains events of default, including:\n\u00b7\nnon-compliance with the covenants under the Credit Facility, including financial covenants and covenants relating to hosted payloads and launch and in-orbit insurance;\n\u00b7\ncross-default with other indebtedness;\n\u00b7\ninsolvency of any obligor under the Credit Facility;\n\u00b7\nrevocation of the COFACE insurance policy;\n\u00b7\nfailure to maintain our current satellite constellation or complete Iridium NEXT by a specified time; and\n\u00b7\na determination by the lenders that we have experienced a material adverse change in our business.\nSome of these events of default are outside of our control or otherwise difficult to satisfy. If we experience an event of default, the lenders may require repayment in full of all principal and interest outstanding under the Credit Facility. It is unlikely we would have adequate funds to repay such amounts prior to the scheduled maturity of the Credit Facility. If we fail to repay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the assets we have pledged under the Credit Facility, which includes substantially all of our assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Facility restricts the manner in which we may operate our business, which may prevent us from successfully implementing our business plan.\nThe Credit Facility contains restrictions on the operation of our business, including limits on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\ncarry out mergers and acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ndispose of, or grant liens on, our assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nincur indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nprepay indebtedness; and\n\u00b7\nmake loans, guarantees or indemnities.\nThe Credit Facility also prohibits us from paying dividends to holders of our preferred stock, including our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, if we are unable to certify that we anticipate being able to comply with the financial covenants of the Credit Facility for the next twelve months each time we declare a dividend. If we are unable to make that certification, we will not be able to pay the dividends on our outstanding preferred stock. If we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock for six quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock collectively will have the power to elect two members of our board of directors. The interests of the holders of our preferred stock may differ from those of our other stockholders. In addition, any dividend we fail to pay will accrue, and the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to a preferential distribution of the original purchase price per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends before any distribution may be made to holders of our common stock in connection with any liquidation event.\nComplying with these restrictions may cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our common stock and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business plan and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions.\nIf we are unable to effectively develop and deploy Iridium NEXT before our current satellite constellation ceases to provide a commercially acceptable level of service, our business will suffer.\nWe are currently developing Iridium NEXT, which we expect to commence launching in 2016. While we expect our current satellite constellation to provide a commercially acceptable level of service through the transition to Iridium NEXT, we cannot guarantee it will do so. If we are unable to effectively deploy Iridium NEXT for any reason, whether as a result of insufficient funds, manufacturing or launch delays, launch failures, in-orbit satellite failures, inability to achieve or maintain orbital placement, failure of the satellites to perform as expected, interference between any hosted payload and our network, or delays in receiving regulatory approvals or otherwise, before our current constellation ceases to provide a commercially acceptable level of service, or if we experience backward compatibility problems with our new constellation once deployed, we would likely lose customers and business opportunities to our competitors, resulting in a potentially material decline in revenue and profitability and the inability to service our debt.\nIridium NEXT may not be completed on time, and the costs associated with it may be greater than expected.\nWe estimate that the costs associated with the design, build and launch of Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure upgrades through 2017 will be approximately $3 billion, although our actual costs could substantially exceed this estimate. We may not complete Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure on time, on budget or at all. We have delayed our first launch, originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2015, to 2016 because of delays by our satellite manufacturer and failure of our launch provider, Kosmotras, to obtain approval for launch, and we may experience further delays. The design, manufacture and launch of satellite systems are highly complex and historically have been subject to delays and cost overruns. Development of Iridium NEXT may suffer from additional delays, interruptions or increased costs due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nlower than anticipated internally generated cash flows, including from Aireon and other hosted payloads;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to maintain our ability to make draws under the Credit Facility, including by reason of our failure to satisfy any ongoing financial or other condition to making draws;\n\u00b7\noperating and other requirements imposed by the lenders under the Credit Facility;\n\u00b7\nour and Thales\u2019s ability to design and manufacture the Iridium NEXT satellites on time and on budget, including issues that might be found late in the process, for example during systems-level testing;\n\u00b7\ninterference between any hosted payload and our network;\n\u00b7\ncomplex integration of our ground segment with the Iridium NEXT satellites and the transition from our current constellation;\n\u00b7\ndenial or delays in receipt of regulatory approvals or non-compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nthe breakdown or failure of equipment or systems;\n\u00b7\nnon-performance by third-party contractors, including the prime system contractor;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to license necessary technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n\u00b7\nuse of the SpaceX launch vehicle, which has a limited operating history, or the failure of SpaceX to sustain its business;\n\u00b7\nlaunch delays or failures or in-orbit satellite failures once launched or the decision to manufacture additional replacement satellites for future launches;\n\u00b7\nlabor disputes or disruptions in labor productivity or the unavailability of skilled labor;\n\u00b7\nincreases in the costs of materials;\n\u00b7\nchanges in project scope;\n\u00b7\nadditional requirements imposed by changes in laws; or\n\u00b7\nsevere weather or catastrophic events, such as fires, earthquakes or storms.\nIf the design, manufacture and deployment of Iridium NEXT costs more or takes longer than we anticipate, our ability to continue to develop Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure could be compromised.\nOur Iridium NEXT launch strategy includes a launch of two satellites using a Russian launch services provider, which may not be able to obtain approval for launch.\nOur strategy to launch our 72 Iridium NEXT satellites includes a planned launch of two satellites on a Dnepr rocket under contract with International Space Company Kosmotras, or Kosmotras, a Russian launch services provider, with the remaining 70 satellites to be launched on seven Falcon 9 rockets under contract with Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX. Kosmotras has, to date, been unable to secure approval from the Russian Ministry of Defense to launch the Dnepr rocket from the military base in Yasny, Russia. If we cannot launch these two satellites as planned, we would need to arrange for their launch on another launch vehicle, which could increase our costs. We may also be unable to recover the amounts we have already paid to Kosmotras.\nLoss of any Iridium NEXT satellite during launch or delays in our launch schedule could delay or impair our ability to offer our services or increase our costs.\nThe launch of our Iridium NEXT satellites will be subject to the inherent risk of launch failures, which could result in the loss or destruction of one or more satellites. We have entered into our launch services agreement with SpaceX, pursuant to which SpaceX will provide launch services to us in connection with our deployment of Iridium NEXT. The SpaceX agreement contemplates seven launches of ten satellites each on SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket over a two-year period. SpaceX is a rapidly growing company in a technically complicated industry and is working to meet an aggressive launch manifest. A failure by SpaceX to maintain its launch schedule could expose us to delay or the need to utilize an alternate launch services provider, which could substantially increase our launch costs. We have also entered into a launch services agreement with Kosmotras pursuant to which Kosmotras will provide supplemental or alternative launch services for Iridium NEXT. We have exercised an option to have Kosmotras launch two Iridium NEXT satellites. The use of Kosmotras to replace one or more of the contemplated SpaceX launches would increase our launch costs.\nWe do not expect to be able to fully insure all of our Iridium NEXT launches prior to the first launch, as a result of which we may be subject to increased costs.\nWe have not obtained 100% of the insurance for our second and subsequent planned launches and may not be able to do so prior to the first launch. Obtaining launch and in-orbit insurance in installments subjects us to the risk that the market for insurance for later launches may be adversely affected by launch or in-orbit failures on earlier launches or by other changes in market conditions. If we experience any such problems on our early launches, our cost to obtain insurance for the remaining portion of our later launches may exceed our estimates, or we may not be able to obtain such insurance at all. If we are not able to secure insurance for the remaining portion of our later launches and experience launch or in-orbit losses, we may be required to consume our nine ground and six in-orbit spare satellites. If such losses exceed our available spares and the proceeds from the insurance we are able to place, we may substantially exceed our cost estimates for the deployment of Iridium NEXT or be unable to complete the deployment of Iridium NEXT at all.\nThe portion of the launch and in-orbit insurance we have obtained to date contains, consistent with the terms of the Credit Facility, elements of self-insurance and deductibles, providing reimbursement only after a specified number of satellite failures. The coverage we are seeking for installments of one or more launches contains similar elements of self-insurance and deductibles. As a result, even if we obtain full launch and in-orbit insurance for each launch, a failure of one or more of our satellites, or the occurrence of equipment failures and other related problems, could constitute an uninsured loss and could harm our financial condition. Furthermore, launch and in-orbit insurance does not cover lost revenue. For more information regarding the terms of our launch and in-orbit insurance, see \u201cBusiness - Our Network - Iridium NEXT,\u201d above.\nOur satellites have a limited life and may fail prematurely, which would cause our network to be compromised and materially and adversely affect our business, prospects and profitability.\nSince we introduced commercial services in 2001, we have experienced twelve satellite losses, most recently in August 2014. Eleven of our satellites have failed in orbit, which has resulted in either the complete loss of the affected satellites or the loss of the ability of the satellite to carry traffic on the network, and one satellite was lost as a result of a collision with a non-operational Russian satellite. Also, our satellites have already exceeded their original design lives. While actual useful life typically exceeds original design life, the useful lives of our satellites may be shorter than we expect, and additional satellites may fail or collide with space debris or other satellites in the future. Although to date we have had an in-orbit spare available to replace each lost satellite, if we experience a failure in an orbital plane other than a plane in which we have a spare, we do not expect to replace the failure until we have an Iridium NEXT satellite available to do so. As a result, while we expect our current constellation to provide a commercially acceptable level of service through the transition to Iridium NEXT, we cannot guarantee it will be able to do so. In-orbit failure may result from various causes, including component failure, loss of power or fuel, inability to control positioning of the satellite, solar or other astronomical events, including solar radiation and flares, and space debris. Other factors that could affect the useful lives of our satellites include the quality of construction, gradual degradation of solar panels and the durability of components. Radiation-induced failure of satellite components may result in damage to or loss of a satellite before the end of its expected life. As our constellation has aged, some of our satellites have experienced individual component failures affecting their coverage or transmission capacity, and other satellites may experience such failures in the future, which could adversely affect the reliability of their service or result in total failure of the satellite. As a result, fewer than 66 of our current in-orbit satellites are fully functioning at any time. Although we do not incur any direct cash costs related to the failure of a satellite, if a satellite fails, we record an impairment charge in our statement of operations to reduce the remaining net book value of that satellite to zero, and any such impairment charges could depress our net income for the period in which the failure occurs.\nFrom time to time, we are advised by our customers and end users of temporary intermittent losses of signal cutting off calls in progress, preventing completions of calls when made or disrupting the transmission of data. If the magnitude or frequency of such problems increase and we are no longer able to provide a commercially acceptable level of service, our business and financial results and our reputation would be hurt and our ability to pursue our business plan would be compromised.\nWe may be required in the future to make further changes to our constellation to maintain or improve its performance. Any such changes may require prior Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, approval, and the FCC may subject the approval to other conditions that could be unfavorable to our business. In addition, from time to time we may reposition our satellites within the constellation in order to optimize our service, which could result in degraded service during the repositioning period. Although we have some ability to remedy some types of problems affecting the performance of our satellites remotely from the ground, the physical repair of our satellites in space is not feasible.\nOur agreements with U.S. government customers, particularly the DoD, which represent a significant portion of our revenue, are subject to termination.\nThe U.S. government, through a dedicated gateway owned and operated by the DoD, has been and continues to be, directly and indirectly, our largest customer, representing 23% and 21% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We provide the majority of our services to the U.S. government pursuant to our Gateway Maintenance and Support Services, or GMSS, and EMSS contracts. We entered into these contracts in September 2013 and October 2013, respectively. The GMSS contract provides for a one-year base term and up to four additional one-year options exercisable at the election of the U.S. government, two of which have been exercised so far, and the EMSS contract provides for a five-year term. The U.S. government may terminate these agreements, in whole or in part, at any time for its convenience. If the U.S. government terminates either of the agreements or decides not to exercise options under the GMSS agreement, we would lose a significant portion of our revenue.\nWe are dependent on intellectual property licensed from third parties to operate our constellation and sell our devices and for the enhancement of our existing products and services.\nWe license critical system technology, including software and systems, to operate and maintain our network as well as technical information for the design, manufacture and sale of our devices. This intellectual property is essential to our ability to continue to operate our constellation and sell our services and devices. In addition, we are dependent on third parties to develop enhancements to our current products and services even in circumstances where we own the intellectual property. If any third-party owner of such intellectual property were to terminate any license agreement with us or cease to support and service this technology or perform development on our behalf, or if we are unable to renew such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all, it may be difficult, more expensive or impossible to obtain such technology or services from alternative vendors. Any substitute technology may also be costly to develop and integrate, or could have lower quality or performance standards, which would adversely affect the quality of our products and services. In connection with the design, manufacture and operation of Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure and the development of new products and services to be offered on Iridium NEXT, we may be required to obtain additional intellectual property rights from third parties. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to obtain such intellectual property rights\non commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain such intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure on budget or at all or may not be able to develop new products and services to be offered on Iridium NEXT.\nOur products could fail to perform or could perform at reduced levels of service because of technological malfunctions or deficiencies or events outside of our control, which would seriously harm our business and reputation.\nOur products and services are subject to the risks inherent in a large-scale, complex telecommunications system employing advanced technology. Any disruption to our satellites, services, information systems or telecommunications infrastructure could result in the inability of our customers to receive our services for an indeterminate period of time. These customers include government agencies conducting mission-critical work throughout the world, as well as consumers and businesses located in remote areas of the world and operating under harsh environmental conditions where traditional telecommunications services may not be readily available. Any disruption to our services or extended periods of reduced levels of service could cause us to lose customers or revenue, result in delays or cancellations of future implementations of our products and services, result in failure to attract customers or result in litigation, customer service or repair work that would involve substantial costs and distract management from operating our business. The failure of any of the diverse elements of our system, including our satellites, our commercial gateway, our satellite teleport network facilities or our satellite network operations center, to function as required could render our system unable to perform at the quality and capacity levels required for success. Any system failures, repeated product failures or shortened product life or extended reduced levels of service could reduce our sales, increase costs or result in warranty or liability claims or litigation, cause us to extend our warranty period and seriously harm our business.\nAs our product portfolio expands, our failure to manage growth effectively could impede our ability to execute our business plan, and we may experience increased costs or disruption in our operations.\nWe currently face a variety of challenges, including maintaining the infrastructure and systems necessary for us to manage the growth of our business. As our product portfolio continues to expand, the responsibilities of our management team and other company resources also grow. Consequently, we may further strain our management and other company resources with the increased complexities and administrative burdens associated with a larger, more complex product portfolio. For example, we have in the past experienced quality issues in connection with the introduction of new products and services, and we may experience such issues in the future. Our failure to meet these challenges as a result of insufficient management or other resources could significantly impede our ability to execute our business plan, which relies in part on our ability to leverage our largely fixed-cost infrastructure. To properly manage our growth, we may need to hire and retain additional personnel, upgrade our existing operational management and financial and reporting systems, and improve our business processes and controls. Failure to effectively manage the expansion of our product portfolio in a cost-effective manner could result in declines in product and service quality and customer satisfaction, disruption of our operations or increased costs, any of which would reduce our ability to increase our profitability.\nAs we and our distributors expand our offerings to include more consumer-oriented devices, we are more likely to be subject to product liability claims, recalls or litigation, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nThrough our network of distributors, we offer several products and services aimed at individual consumers, and we and our distributors continue to introduce additional products and services. These products and services, such as satellite handsets, personal locator devices and location-based services, may be used in isolated and dangerous locations, including emergency response situations, and users who suffer property damage, personal injury or death while using the product or service may seek to assert claims or bring lawsuits against us. We seek to limit our exposure to such claims through appropriate disclosures, indemnification provisions and disclaimers, but these steps may not be effective. We also maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance may not cover any particular claim or litigation, or the amount of insurance may be inadequate to cover the claims brought against us. Product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and might not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, it is possible that our products would become the subject of a product recall as a result of a product defect. We do not maintain recall insurance, so any recall could have a significant effect on our financial results. In addition to the direct expenses of product liability claims, recalls and litigation, a claim, recall or litigation might cause us adverse publicity, which could harm our reputation and compromise our ability to sell our products in the future.\nThe collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights.\nWe transmit, and in some cases store, end user data, including personal information. In jurisdictions around the world, the transmission and storage of personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers\u2019 privacy and security. The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving. These laws may be interpreted, applied and enforced in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change\nour business practices. Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure. We could face a variety of enforcement actions or government inquiries or be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations.\nIn addition, if end users allege that their personal information is not collected, stored, transmitted, used or disclosed appropriately or in accordance with our privacy policies or applicable laws, we could have liability to them, including claims and litigation resulting from such allegations. Any failure on our part to protect end users\u2019 privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence, hurt our reputation and ultimately result in the loss of users.\nOur satellites may collide with space debris or another spacecraft, which could adversely affect the performance of our constellation.\nIn February 2009, we lost an operational satellite as a result of a collision with a non-operational Russian satellite. Although we have some ability to actively maneuver our satellites to avoid potential collisions with space debris or other spacecraft, this ability is limited by, among other factors, uncertainties and inaccuracies in the projected orbit location of and predicted conjunctions with debris objects tracked and cataloged by the U.S. government. Additionally, some space debris is too small to be tracked and therefore its orbital location is completely unknown; nevertheless, this debris is still large enough to potentially cause severe damage or a failure of our satellites should a collision occur. If our constellation experiences additional satellite collisions with space debris or other spacecraft, our service could be impaired.\nThe space debris created by the February 2009 satellite collision may cause damage to other spacecraft positioned in a similar orbital altitude.\nThe 2009 collision of one of our satellites with a non-operational Russian satellite created a space debris field concentrated in the orbital altitude where the collision occurred, and thus increased the risk of space debris damaging or interfering with the operation of our satellites, which travel in this orbital altitude, as well as satellites owned by third parties, such as U.S. or foreign governments or agencies and other satellite operators. Although there are tools used by us and providers of tracking services, such as the U.S. Joint Space Operations Center, to detect, track and identify space debris, we or third parties may not be able to maneuver the satellites away from such debris in a timely manner. Any such collision could potentially expose us to significant losses and liability if we were found to be at fault.\nIf we experience operational disruptions with respect to our commercial gateway or operations center, we may not be able to provide service to our customers.\nOur commercial satellite network traffic is supported by a gateway in Tempe, Arizona, and we operate our satellite constellation from our satellite network operations center in Leesburg, Virginia. Currently, we do not have a backup facility for our gateway, and both facilities are subject to the risk of significant malfunctions or catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events and would be difficult to replace or repair and could require substantial lead-time to do so. Material changes in the operation of these facilities may be subject to prior FCC approval, and the FCC might not give such approval or may subject the approval to other conditions that could be unfavorable to our business. Our gateway and operations center may also experience service shutdowns or periods of reduced service in the future as a result of equipment failure, delays in deliveries or regulatory issues. Any such failure would impede our ability to provide service to our customers.\nWe may be negatively affected by current global economic conditions.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as individual consumers, businesses and governments may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values or budgetary constraints. Reduced demand would cause a decline in our revenue and make it more difficult for us to operate profitably, potentially compromising our ability to pursue our business plan. While we expect the number of our subscribers and revenue to continue to grow, we expect the future growth rate will be slower than our historical growth and may not continue in every quarter of every year. We expect our future growth rate will be affected by the sluggish global economy, increased competition, maturation of the satellite communications industry and the difficulty in sustaining high growth rates as we increase in size. Any substantial appreciation of the U.S. dollar may also negatively affect our growth by increasing the cost of our products and services in foreign countries.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the rules and regulations of the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. We perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nMaintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. In connection with the preparation of our quarterly report for the three months ended September 30, 2012, management discovered an error caused by a previously existing material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting relating to accounting for income taxes. This material weakness led to the need for the restatement of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and for the quarters ended December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2011. If we fail to maintain effective controls over financial reporting in the future, it could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements.\nWe could lose market share and revenue as a result of increasing competition from companies in the wireless communications industry, including cellular and other satellite operators, and from the extension of land-based communications services.\nWe face intense competition in all of our markets, which could result in a loss of customers and lower revenue and make it more difficult for us to enter new markets. We compete primarily on the basis of coverage, quality, portability and pricing of services and products.\nThe provision of satellite-based services and products is subject to downward price pressure when capacity exceeds demand or as a result of aggressive discounting by some operators under financial pressure to expand their respective market share. In addition, we may face competition from new competitors, new technologies or new equipment, including proposed new LEO constellations. For example, we may face competition for our land-based services in the United States from incipient ancillary terrestrial component, or ATC, service providers who are designing a satellite operating business and a terrestrial component around their spectrum holdings. In addition, some of our competitors have announced plans for the launch of additional satellites. As a result of competition, we may not be able to successfully retain our existing customers and attract new customers.\nIn addition to our satellite-based competitors, terrestrial voice and data service providers, both wireline and wireless, could further expand into rural and remote areas and provide the same general types of services and products that we provide through our satellite-based system. Although satellite communications services and terrestrial communications services are not perfect substitutes, the two compete in some markets and for some services. Consumers generally perceive terrestrial wireless voice communication products and services as cheaper and more convenient than those that are satellite-based. Many of our terrestrial competitors have greater resources, wider name recognition and newer technologies than we do. In addition, industry consolidation could hurt us by increasing the scale or scope of our competitors, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete.\nSome of the hardware and software we use in operating our gateway is significantly customized and tailored to meet our requirements and specifications and could be difficult and expensive to service, upgrade or replace.\nSome of the hardware and software we use in operating our gateway is significantly customized and tailored to meet our requirements and specifications and could be difficult and expensive to service, upgrade or replace. Although we maintain inventories of some spare parts, it nonetheless may be difficult, expensive or impossible to obtain replacement parts for the hardware due to a limited number of those parts being manufactured to our requirements and specifications. In addition, our business plan contemplates updating or replacing some of the hardware and software in our network as technology advances, but the complexity of our requirements and specifications may present us with technical and operational challenges that complicate or otherwise make it expensive or infeasible to carry out such upgrades and replacements. If we are not able to suitably service, upgrade or replace our equipment, our ability to provide our services and therefore to generate revenue could be harmed.\nRapid and significant technological changes in the satellite communications industry may impair our competitive position and require us to make significant additional capital expenditures.\nThe satellite communications industry is subject to rapid advances and innovations in technology. We may face competition in the future from companies using new technologies and new satellite systems. New technology could render our system obsolete or less competitive by satisfying customer demand in more attractive ways or through the introduction of incompatible standards. Particular technological developments that could adversely affect us include the deployment by our competitors of new satellites with greater power, flexibility, efficiency or capabilities than our current constellation or Iridium NEXT, as well as continuing improvements in terrestrial wireless technologies. For us to keep up with technological changes and remain competitive, we may need to make significant capital expenditures, including capital to design and launch new products and services on Iridium NEXT. Customer acceptance of the products and services that we offer will continually be affected by technology-based differences in our product and service offerings compared to those of our competitors. New technologies may also be protected by patents or other intellectual property laws and therefore may not be available to us. Any failure on our part to implement new technology within our system may compromise our ability to compete.\nUse by our competitors of L-band spectrum for terrestrial services could interfere with our services.\nIn February 2003, the FCC adopted ATC rules that permit satellite service providers to establish terrestrial wireless networks in previously satellite-only bands, subject to certain requirements intended to ensure that terrestrial services remain ancillary to primary satellite operations. In November 2012, Globalstar, Inc. filed a petition for rulemaking, asking the FCC to permit it to provide terrestrial service in L-band spectrum and to eliminate the requirements for primary satellite operations, which we are opposing. The implementation of ATC services by satellite service providers in the United States or other countries may result in increased competition for the right to use L-band spectrum in the 1.6 GHz band, which we use to provide our services, and such competition may make it difficult for us to obtain or retain the spectrum resources we require for our existing and future services. In addition, the FCC\u2019s decision to permit ATC services was based on assumptions relating to the level of interference that the provision of ATC services would likely cause to other satellite service providers that use the L-band spectrum. If the FCC\u2019s assumptions prove inaccurate, or the level of ATC services provided exceeds those estimated by the FCC, ATC services could interfere with our satellites and devices, which may adversely affect our services. Outside the United States, other countries have implemented or are considering implementing regulations to facilitate ATC-like services.\nOur networks and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks.\nWe expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our ability to compete for business and protect our customers and our reputation. Our network and those of our third-party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully obtain or use information on the network or cause interruptions, delays or malfunctions in our operations, any of which could harm our reputation, cause demand for our products and services to fall and compromise our ability to pursue our business plans. Recently, there have been reported a number of significant, widespread security breaches that have compromised network integrity for many companies and governmental agencies, in some cases reportedly originating from outside the United States. In addition, there are reportedly private products available in the market today which attempt to unlawfully intercept communications made on our network. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches. In addition, our customer contracts may not adequately protect us against liability to third parties with whom our customers conduct business. Although we have implemented and intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could lower network availability, which could harm our business and our reputation.\nWe are dependent on third parties to market and sell our products and services.\nWe rely on third-party distributors to market and sell our products and services to end users and to determine the prices end users pay. We also depend on our distributors to develop innovative and improved solutions and applications integrating our product and service offerings. As a result of these arrangements, we are dependent on the performance of our distributors to generate most of our revenue. Our distributors operate independently of us, and we have limited control over their operations, which exposes us to significant risks. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products and services and may also market and sell competitive products and services. In addition, our distributors may not comply with the laws and regulatory requirements in their local jurisdictions, which could limit their ability to market or sell our products and services. If our distributors develop faulty or poorly performing products using our technology or services, we may be subject to claims, and our reputation could be harmed. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or if we are unable to locate competent distributors in particular countries and secure their services on favorable terms, we may be unable to increase or maintain our revenue in these markets or enter new markets, we may not realize our expected growth, and our brand image and reputation could be hurt.\nIn addition, we may lose distributors due to competition, consolidation, regulatory developments, business developments affecting our distributors or their customers, or for other reasons. In 2009, one of our largest competitors, Inmarsat, acquired our then largest distributor, Stratos Global Wireless, Inc., and in January 2014, Inmarsat acquired Globe Wireless, one of our service providers. Following each acquisition, Inmarsat essentially stopped promoting sales of our products and services, and they may further reduce their efforts in the future. Any future consolidation of our distributors would further increase our reliance on a few key distributors of our services and the amount of volume discounts that we may have to give those distributors. Our two largest distributors, Applied Satellite Technology LTD and Inmarsat, represented a total of 13% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our ten largest distributors represented, in the aggregate, 37% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss of any of these distributors, or a decrease in the level of effort expended by any of them to promote our products and services, could reduce the distribution of our products and services as well as the development of new products and applications.\nWe rely on a limited number of key vendors for supply of equipment and services.\nWe currently rely on Benchmark Electronics Inc., or Benchmark, as the exclusive manufacturer of our current devices, including our mobile handsets, L-Band transceivers, short-burst data devices and Iridium Pilot terminals. Benchmark may choose to terminate its business relationship with us when its current contractual obligations are completed, or if we default under our current agreement. We also utilize sole source suppliers for some of the component parts of our devices. If Benchmark or any of our other suppliers were to terminate its relationship with us, we may not be able to find a replacement supplier in a timely manner, at an acceptable price or at all.\nOur manufacturer and suppliers may become capacity-constrained as a result of a surge in demand, a natural disaster or other event, resulting in a shortage or interruption in supplies or an inability to meet increased demand. Although we may be able to replace sole source suppliers, there could be a substantial period of time in which our products would not be available; any new relationship may involve higher costs and delays in development and delivery, and we may encounter technical challenges in successfully replicating the manufacturing processes. If our manufacturers or suppliers terminate their relationships with us, fail to provide equipment or services to us on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products or services to our customers in a competitive manner, which could in turn negatively affect our financial results and our reputation.\nIn addition, we depend on Boeing to provide operations and maintenance services with respect to our satellite network, including engineering, systems analysis, integration and testing of new equipment and operations and maintenance services, from our technical support center in Chandler, Arizona and our satellite network operations center in Leesburg, Virginia. Technological competence is critical to our business and depends, to a significant degree, on the work of technically skilled personnel, such as our Boeing contractors. If Boeing\u2019s performance falls below expected levels or if Boeing has difficulties retaining the personnel servicing our network, the operations of our satellite network could be compromised. In addition, if Boeing terminates its agreement with us, we may not be able to find a replacement provider on favorable terms or at all, which could impair the operations and performance of our network. Replacing Boeing as the operator of our current satellite system could also trigger de-orbit rights held by the U.S. government, which, if exercised, would eliminate our ability to offer satellite communications services altogether.\nWe have been and may in the future become subject to claims that our products violate the patent or intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and disruptive to us.\nWe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation. As a result, we or our products may become subject to intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. The defense of intellectual property suits is both costly and time-consuming, even if ultimately successful, and may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. An adverse determination in litigation to which we may become a party could, among other things:\n\u00b7\nsubject us to significant liabilities to third parties, including treble damages;\n\u00b7\nrequire disputed rights to be licensed from a third party for royalties that may be substantial;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to cease using technology that is important to our business; or\n\u00b7\nprohibit us from selling some or all of our products or offering some or all of our services.\nConducting and expanding our operations outside the United States creates numerous risks, which may harm our operations and compromise our ability to expand our international operations.\nWe have significant operations outside the United States. We estimate that commercial data traffic originating outside the United States, excluding our Iridium OpenPort broadband data service traffic, accounted for 67% and 69% of total commercial data traffic for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, while commercial voice traffic originating outside the United States, excluding Iridium OpenPort traffic, accounted for 88% and 90% of total commercial voice traffic for the years ended December 31,\n2015 and 2014, respectively. We cannot provide the precise geographical distribution of revenue from end users because we do not contract directly with them. Instead, we determine the country in which we earn our revenue based on where we invoice our distributors. These distributors sell services directly or indirectly to end users, who may be located or use our products and services elsewhere. We and our distributors are also seeking authorization to sell our services in additional countries.\nConducting operations outside the United States involves numerous risks and, while expanding our international operations would advance our growth, it would also increase our exposure to these risks. For example, in 2013 we commenced the provision of satellite communications services in Russia through a local subsidiary and its authorized Russian service providers and subsequently secured a site and commenced construction of a dedicated gateway in Russia. The U.S. government has recently imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian corporations, banks, and citizens and might impose additional sanctions in the future. If such sanctions, or any Russian response to such sanctions, affects our operations in Russia, it could limit our growth in Russia or prevent us from continuing to operate there at all, which would reduce our revenues.\nOther risks associated with the proposed expansion of our international operations include:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in penetrating new markets due to established and entrenched competitors;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in developing products and services that are tailored to the needs of local customers;\n\u00b7\nlack of local acceptance or knowledge of our products and services;\n\u00b7\nlack of recognition of our products and services;\n\u00b7\nunavailability of or difficulties in establishing relationships with distributors;\n\u00b7\nsignificant investments, including the development and deployment of dedicated gateways, as some countries require physical gateways within their jurisdiction to connect the traffic coming to and from their territory;\n\u00b7\ninstability of international economies and governments;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws and policies affecting trade and investment in other jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nexposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection in other jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in obtaining required regulatory authorizations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing legal rights in other jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nlocal domestic ownership requirements;\n\u00b7\nrequirements that operational activities be performed in-country;\n\u00b7\nchanging and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements; and\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange rates and exchange controls.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize, it could affect our ability to successfully compete and expand internationally.\nGovernment organizations, foreign military and intelligence agencies, natural disaster aid associations and event-driven response agencies use our commercial voice and data satellite communications services. Accordingly, we may experience reductions in usage due to changing global circumstances, including as a result of changes in the nature of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, or continued reductions in U.S. and foreign personnel in those countries.\nThe prices for our products and services are typically denominated in U.S. dollars. Any appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will increase the cost of our products and services to our international customers and, as a result, may reduce the competitiveness of our international offerings and make it more difficult for us to grow internationally. Conversely, in some locations, primarily Russia, we conduct business in the local currency, and a depreciation of the local currency against the U.S. dollar will reduce the U.S. dollar value of our revenues from those countries. Russia has recently experienced significant currency depreciation against the U.S. dollar.\nWe are currently unable to offer service in important regions of the world due to regulatory requirements, which limits our growth.\nOur ability to provide service in some regions is limited by local regulations. Some countries have specific regulatory requirements such as local domestic ownership requirements or requirements for physical gateways within their jurisdiction to connect traffic coming to and from their territory. While we have had discussions with parties in these countries to satisfy these regulatory requirements, we may not be able to find an acceptable local partner or reach an agreement to develop additional gateways, or the cost\nof developing and deploying such gateways may be prohibitive, which could impair our ability to expand our product and service offerings in such areas and undermine our value for potential users who require service in these areas. Also, other countries where we already provide service may impose similar requirements, which could restrict our ability to continue to provide service in those countries. The inability to offer to sell our products and services in all major international markets could impair our international growth. In addition, the construction of such gateways in foreign countries may trigger and require us to comply with various U.S. regulatory requirements that could conflict with or contravene the laws or regulations of the local jurisdiction. Any of these developments could limit, delay or otherwise interfere with our ability to construct gateways or other infrastructure or network solutions around the world.\nThe U.S. government, Motorola Solutions and Boeing may unilaterally require us to de-orbit our current constellation upon the occurrence of specified events.\nWhen Iridium Satellite purchased the assets of Iridium LLC, a non-affiliated debtor in possession, out of bankruptcy, Boeing, Motorola and the U.S. government required specified de-orbit rights as a way to control potential liability exposure arising from future operation of the constellation. As a result, Iridium Satellite, Boeing, Motorola and the U.S. government entered into an agreement giving the U.S. government the right, in its sole discretion, to require us to de-orbit our constellation upon the occurrence of specified events, including any time on or after January 1, 2015 or if more than four of our satellites have insufficient fuel to execute a 12-month de-orbit, both of which have already occurred. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us to de-orbit any of our individual functioning satellites, including in-orbit spares, that have been in orbit for more than seven years, unless the U.S. government grants a postponement. All of our functioning satellites have been in orbit for more than seven years.\nMotorola Solutions, as successor to Motorola, and Boeing each also have the right to require us to de-orbit our constellation pursuant to our agreements with them upon the occurrence of specified events.\nWe cannot guarantee that the U.S. government, Motorola Solutions or Boeing will not unilaterally exercise their de-orbiting rights upon the occurrence of any of the specified events. If we were required to de-orbit our constellation, we would be unable to continue to provide mobile satellite communications services.\nWe may be unable to obtain and maintain contractually required liability insurance, and the insurance we obtain may not cover all liabilities to which we may become subject.\nUnder our agreement with Motorola, we are required to maintain an in-orbit liability insurance policy with a de-orbiting endorsement. The current policy, together with the de-orbiting endorsement, covers amounts that we and other specified parties may become liable to pay for bodily injury and property damages to third parties related to processing, maintaining and operating our satellite constellation and, in the case of the de-orbiting endorsement, a mass de-orbit of our current satellite constellation. Our current policy has a one-year term, which expires on December 8, 2016, and excludes coverage for all third-party damages relating to the 2009 collision of our satellite with a non-operational Russian satellite. The price, terms and availability of insurance have fluctuated significantly since we began offering commercial satellite services. The cost of obtaining insurance can vary as a result of either satellite failures or general conditions in the insurance industry. Higher premiums on insurance policies would increase our cost. In-orbit liability insurance policies on satellites may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition to higher premiums, insurance policies may provide for higher deductibles, shorter coverage periods and additional policy exclusions. For example, our current de-orbit insurance covers only twelve months from attachment and therefore would not cover losses arising outside that timeframe. Our failure to renew our current in-orbit liability insurance policy or obtain a replacement policy would trigger de-orbit rights held by the U.S. government and Boeing described in the immediately preceding risk factor, which, if exercised, would eliminate our ability to provide mobile satellite communications services. In addition, even if we continue to maintain an in-orbit liability insurance policy, the coverage may not protect us against all third-party losses, which could be material.\nOur current in-orbit liability insurance policy contains, and we expect any future policies would likewise contain, specified exclusions and material change limitations customary in the industry. These exclusions may relate to, among other things, losses resulting from in-orbit collisions such as the one we experienced in 2009, acts of war, insurrection, terrorism or military action, government confiscation, strikes, riots, civil commotions, labor disturbances, sabotage, unauthorized use of the satellites and nuclear or radioactive contamination, as well as claims directly or indirectly occasioned as a result of noise, pollution, electrical and electromagnetic interference and interference with the use of property.\nIn addition to our in-orbit liability insurance policy, we are required to purchase product liability insurance to cover the potential liability of Motorola Solutions, as the manufacturer of the satellites in our current constellation. We may not in the future be able to renew this product liability coverage on reasonable terms and conditions, or at all. Our failure to maintain this insurance could increase our exposure to third-party damages that may be caused by any of our satellites. If we are unable to obtain such insurance on commercially reasonable terms and the U.S. government has not agreed to cover the amounts that would have otherwise been paid by\nsuch insurance, Motorola Solutions could invoke its de-orbit rights which, if exercised, would eliminate our ability to provide mobile satellite communications services.\nWireless devices\u2019 radio frequency emissions are the subject of regulation and litigation concerning their environmental effects, which includes alleged health and safety risks. As a result, we may be subject to new regulations, demand for our services may decrease, and we could face liability based on alleged health risks.\nThere has been adverse publicity concerning alleged health risks associated with radio frequency transmissions from portable hand-held telephones that have transmitting antennas. Lawsuits have been filed against participants in the wireless industry alleging a number of adverse health consequences, including cancer, as a result of wireless phone usage. Other claims allege consumer harm from failures to disclose information about radio frequency emissions or aspects of the regulatory regimes governing those emissions. Although we have not been party to any such lawsuits, we may be exposed to such litigation in the future. While we comply with applicable standards for radio frequency emissions and power and do not believe that there is valid scientific evidence that use of our phones poses a health risk, courts or governmental agencies could determine otherwise. Any such finding could reduce our revenue and profitability and expose us and other wireless providers to litigation, which, even if frivolous or unsuccessful, could be costly to defend.\nIf consumers\u2019 health concerns over radio frequency emissions increase, they may be discouraged from using wireless handsets. Further, government authorities might increase regulation of wireless handsets as a result of these health concerns. Any actual or perceived risk from radio frequency emissions could reduce the number of our subscribers and demand for our products and services.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation, which mandates how we may operate our business and may increase our cost of providing services and slow our expansion into new markets.\nOur ownership and operation of a satellite communications system and the sale of products that operate on that system are subject to significant regulation in the United States, including by the FCC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and others, and in foreign jurisdictions by similar local authorities. The rules and regulations of these U.S. and foreign authorities may change, and such authorities may adopt regulations that limit or restrict our operations as presently conducted or currently contemplated. Such authorities may also make changes in the licenses of our competitors that affect our spectrum. Such changes may significantly affect our business. Further, because regulations in each country are different, we may not be aware if some of our distribution partners or persons with whom we or they do business do not hold the requisite licenses and approvals. Our failure to provide services in accordance with the terms of our licenses or our failure to operate our satellites or ground stations as required by our licenses and applicable laws and government regulations could result in the imposition of government sanctions on us, including the suspension or cancellation of our licenses. Our failure or delay in obtaining the approvals required to operate in other countries would limit or delay our ability to expand our operations into those countries. Our failure to obtain industry-standard certifications for our products could compromise our ability to generate revenue and conduct our business in other countries. Any imposition of sanctions, loss of license or failure to obtain the authorizations necessary to use our assigned radio frequency spectrum and to distribute our products in the United States or foreign jurisdictions could cause us to lose sales, hurt our reputation and impair our ability to pursue our business plan.\nIn addition, one of our subsidiaries, Iridium Carrier Services LLC, holds a common carrier radio license and is thus subject to regulation as a common carrier, including limitations and prior approval requirements with respect to direct or indirect foreign ownership. A change in the manner in which we provide service, or a failure to comply with common carrier regulations or pay required fees, could result in sanctions including fines, loss of authorizations, or the denial of applications for new authorizations or the renewal of existing authorizations.\nSecurity and emergency services regulations in the U.S. and other countries may affect our ability to operate our system and to expand into new markets.\nOur operations are subject to regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security relating to the export of satellites and related technical data as well as our subscriber equipment, the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control relating to transactions involving entities sanctioned by the United States, and the U.S. State Department\u2019s Office of Defense Trade Controls relating to satellite launch. We are also required to provide U.S. and some foreign government law enforcement and security agencies with call interception services and related government assistance, in respect of which we face legal obligations and restrictions in various jurisdictions. Given our global operations and unique network architecture, these requirements and restrictions are not always easy to comply with or harmonize. In addition, some countries require providers of telecommunications services to connect specified emergency numbers to local emergency services. We have discussed and continue to discuss with authorities in various countries the procedures used to satisfy our obligations, and have had to, and may in the future need to, obtain amendments or waivers to licenses or obligations in various countries. Countries are not obligated to grant requested amendments or waivers, and\nthere can be no assurance that relevant authorities will not suspend or revoke our licenses or take other legal actions to attempt to enforce the requirements of their respective jurisdictions.\nThese U.S. and foreign obligations and regulations may limit or delay our ability to offer products and services in a particular country. As new laws and regulations are issued, we may be required to modify our business plans or operations. In addition, changing and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements may cause us to be in compliance with local requirements in one country, while not being in compliance with the laws and regulations of another. If we fail to comply with regulations in the United States or any other country, we could be subject to substantial fines or sanctions that could make it difficult or impossible for us to operate in the United States or such other country, or we may need to make substantial additional expenditures to bring our products and services into compliance with the requirements.\nIf the FCC revokes, modifies or fails to renew our licenses, or fails to grant a new license or modification, our ability to operate will be harmed or eliminated.\nWe hold FCC licenses, specifically a license for our current satellite constellation, licenses for our U.S. gateway and other ground facilities and blanket earth station licenses for U.S. government customers and commercial subscribers, that are subject to revocation if we fail to satisfy specified conditions or to meet prescribed milestones. The FCC licenses are also subject to modification by the FCC. Our current satellite constellation license from the FCC has been extended until January 31, 2018. Our U.S. gateway earth station and the U.S. government customer and commercial subscriber earth station licenses expire between September 2018 and the year 2026. There can be no assurance that the FCC will renew the FCC licenses we hold or grant new ones or modifications, such as our pending application regarding Iridium NEXT. If the FCC revokes, modifies or fails to renew the FCC licenses we hold, or fails to grant a new license or modification, or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our respective FCC licenses, we may not be able to continue to provide mobile satellite communications services.\nPursuing strategic transactions may cause us to incur additional risks.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic transactions from time to time. We may face costs and risks arising from any such transactions, including integrating a new business into our business or managing a joint venture. These risks may include adverse legal, organizational and financial consequences, loss of key customers and distributors and diversion of management\u2019s time.\nIn addition, any major business combination or similar strategic transaction would require approval under the Credit Facility and may require significant external financing. Depending on market conditions, investor perceptions of our company and other factors, we might not be able to obtain approvals under the Credit Facility or financing on acceptable terms, in acceptable amounts or at appropriate times to implement any such transaction. Any such financing, if obtained, may further dilute existing stockholders.\nSpectrum values historically have been volatile, which could cause the value of our business to fluctuate.\nOur business plan is evolving, and it may in the future include forming strategic partnerships to maximize value for our spectrum, network assets and combined service offerings in the United States and internationally. Values that we may be able to realize from such partnerships will depend in part on the value placed on our spectrum authorizations. Valuations of spectrum in other frequency bands historically have been volatile, and we cannot predict at what amount a future partner may be willing to value our spectrum and other assets. In addition, to the extent that the FCC takes action that makes additional spectrum available or promotes the more flexible use or greater availability of existing satellite or terrestrial spectrum allocations, for example by means of spectrum leasing or new spectrum sales, the availability of such additional spectrum could reduce the value of our spectrum authorizations and, as a result, the value of our business.\nOur ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we lose members of our senior management team or key technical personnel.\nWe depend on the continued service of key managerial and technical personnel and personnel with security clearances, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We compete for such personnel with other companies, government entities, academic institutions and other organizations.
