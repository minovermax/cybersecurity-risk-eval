{"cik": "1437106", "company": "Ascent Capital Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the following risk factors in evaluating our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations or an investment in our stock.\nAlthough we describe below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K the risks we consider to be the most material, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends and should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to Brinks Home Security\nBrinks Home Security has a substantial amount of indebtedness and the costs of servicing that debt may materially affect its business.\nBrinks Home Security has a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, Brinks Home Security had principal indebtedness of $1,219,450,000 related to a term loan maturing in September 2022 and a revolving credit facility maturing in September 2021, both under its Credit Agreement, dated March 23, 2012 (as amended and restated, the \"Credit Facility\"), as well as $585,000,000 of 9.125% senior notes (the \"Senior Notes\") due April 2020. At December 31, 2018, Brinks Home Security also had outstanding a 12.5% intercompany promissory note of $12,000,000 due to Ascent Capital in October 2020, of which $9,750,000 was subsequently repaid and $2,250,000 was contributed to Brinks Home Security's stated capital in January 2019. That substantial indebtedness, combined with its other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for Brinks Home Security to satisfy its obligations with respect to its existing and future indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of the agreements governing its indebtedness could result in an event of default under such agreements;\n\u2022\nrequire Brinks Home Security to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations (which also constitutes substantially all of our cash flow) to the payment of interest and principal due under its indebtedness, which will reduce funds available to fund future subscriber account acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the markets in which it operates;\n\u2022\nlimit Brinks Home Security's ability to obtain additional financing required to fund future subscriber account acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nexpose Brinks Home Security to market fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace Brinks Home Security at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of its competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nreduce or delay investments and capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\ncause any refinancing of Brinks Home Security's indebtedness to be at higher interest rates and require Brinks Home Security to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict its business operations.\nThe agreements governing Brinks Home Security's various debt obligations, including its Credit Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes, impose restrictions on its business and the business of its subsidiaries and such restrictions could adversely affect Brinks Home Security's ability to undertake certain corporate actions.\nThe agreements governing Brinks Home Security's indebtedness restrict its ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake certain dividends or distributions with respect to any of its capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans and investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates, including Ascent Capital;\n\u2022\nrestrict subsidiary distributions;\n\u2022\ndissolve, merge or consolidate;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures in excess of certain annual limits;\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nenter into or acquire certain types of AMAs;\n\u2022\nmake certain amendments to its organizational documents;\n\u2022\nmake changes in the nature of its business;\n\u2022\nenter into certain burdensome agreements;\n\u2022\nmake accounting changes;\n\u2022\nuse proceeds of loans to purchase or carry margin stock; and\n\u2022\nprepay its Senior Notes.\nIn addition, Brinks Home Security also must comply with certain financial covenants under the Credit Facility that require it to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of not more than 5.25 to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, each of which is calculated quarterly on a trailing twelve-month basis. In addition, the Credit Facility requires Brinks Home Security to maintain a consolidated senior secured Eligible RMR leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of no more than 31.0 to 1.00 and a consolidated senior secured RMR leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of no more than 31.5 to 1.00, each of which is calculated quarterly on a trailing twelve-month basis. If Brinks Home Security cannot comply with any of these financial covenants, or if Brinks Home Security or any of its subsidiaries fails to comply with the restrictions contained in the Credit Facility, such failure could lead to an event of default and Brinks Home Security may not be able to make additional drawdowns under the revolving portion of the Credit Facility, which would limit its ability to manage its working capital requirements, and could result in the acceleration of a substantial amount of Brinks Home Security's indebtedness.\nBrinks Home Security may be unable to obtain future financing or refinance its existing indebtedness on terms acceptable to Brinks Home Security or at all, which may hinder its ability to grow its business or satisfy is obligations and could adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern.\nBrinks Home Security intends to continue to pursue growth through the acquisition of subscriber accounts through its authorized dealer network, its strategic relationships and its Direct to Consumer Channel, among other means. To continue its growth strategy, it intends to make additional drawdowns under the revolving credit portion of its Credit Facility and may seek financing through new credit arrangements or the possible sale of new securities, any of which may lead to higher leverage or result in higher borrowing costs. In addition, any future downgrade in Brinks Home Security's credit rating could also result in higher borrowing costs. An inability to obtain funding through external financing sources on favorable terms or at all is likely to adversely affect Brinks Home Security's ability to continue or accelerate its subscriber account acquisition activities.\nAdditionally, Brinks Home Security may be unable to refinance its existing indebtedness, which could affect its ability to satisfy its obligations. The maturity date for each of the term loan and the revolving credit facility under the Credit Facility is subject to a springing maturity 181 days prior to the scheduled maturity date of the Senior Notes, or October 3, 2019, if Brinks Home Security is unable to refinance the Senior Notes by that date. Further, as there is substantial doubt about Brinks Home Security's ability to continue as a going concern, Brinks Home Security has received a going concern qualification in connection with its standalone external audit report of its Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is an event of default under Brinks Home Security\u2019s Credit Facility. At any time after the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may, among other options, declare any amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility immediately due and payable and terminate any commitment to make further loans under the Credit Facility. A default under the Credit Facility is also an event of default under the Senior Notes. Further, in connection with management\u2019s negotiations with its creditors, Brinks Home Security did not make its Senior Notes interest payment due on April 1, 2019. The indenture governing the Senior Notes provides for a 30-day cure period on past due interest payments. If an event of default,\nthe holders of the Senior Notes may declare the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and any accrued interest on the Senior Notes to be immediately due and payable.\nBrinks Home Security has obtained a waiver from the Credit Facility revolving loan lenders and a forbearance from the Credit Facility term lenders, in each case with respect to the default in connection with the going concern qualification contained in Brinks Home Security\u2019s external audit report of their Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the \u201cGoing Concern Default\u201d), and in each case through April 30, 2019, subject to the terms and conditions of the waiver and forbearance. The waiver obtained from the Credit Facility revolving loan lenders allows Brinks Home Security to continue to borrow under the revolving credit facility under the Credit Facility for up to $195,000,000 at an alternate base rate plus 3.00%. The forbearance obtained from the Credit Facility term lenders states that the term loan lenders will not exercise remedies with respect to an event of default that may occur from the Going Concern Default. The Going Concern Default and any resulting event of default under the Credit Facility term loan would continue despite the forbearance in respect thereto, absent a waiver from the term loan lenders. To the extent any waiver or forbearance under the Credit Facility expires, any acceleration as a result of an event of default under the Credit Facility would trigger an event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes. To the extent an event of default under such indenture occurs, Brinks Home Security would seek to obtain a waiver or forbearance from the bondholders thereunder. To the extent Brinks Home Security is unable to receive a continuing waiver or forbearance of such a default or event of default, as applicable, from the lenders under its Credit Facility or the bondholders under the indenture governing the Senior Notes, Brinks Home Security would be unable to meet its obligations thereunder and would need to take other measures to satisfy its creditors, which could result in significant negative and other consequences, as described under \"Brinks Home Security has a substantial amount of indebtedness and the costs of servicing that debt may materially affect its business.\"\nBrinks Home Security may be subject to United States Bankruptcy Court proceedings in the near future, which would pose significant risks to its business and to its and our investors.\nBrinks Home Security is currently analyzing various alternatives to address its liquidity and capital structure and is in active dialogue with various stakeholders regarding a possible restructuring. Brinks Home Security is not able to predict its success in attempting to negotiate with these parties. Brinks Home Security has engaged financial and legal advisors to assist it in, among other things, analyzing strategic alternatives to address its liquidity and capital structure, including strategic and refinancing alternatives to restructure its indebtedness. However, if Brinks Home Security\u2019s attempts are unsuccessful or it is unable to complete such a restructuring on satisfactory terms, it may choose to pursue a filing under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. If an agreement is reached and Brinks Home Security decides to pursue a restructuring, it may be necessary for Brinks Home Security and certain of its affiliates to file voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement a restructuring through a plan of reorganization before the bankruptcy court. Brinks Home Security may also conclude that it is necessary to initiate Chapter 11 proceedings to implement a restructuring of its obligations if it is unable to reach an agreement with its creditors and other relevant parties regarding the terms of such a restructuring, or if further events or developments arise that necessitate it seeking relief in Chapter 11. It may be necessary to commence such a bankruptcy case in the very near future. Also, if an agreement is not reached, certain creditors could commence involuntary bankruptcy cases against Brinks Home Security.\nSo long as a bankruptcy case continues, Brinks Home Security\u2019s senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on its business operations. Bankruptcy cases also might make it more difficult to retain management and other personnel necessary to the success and growth of Brinks Home Security\u2019s business. In addition, the longer a bankruptcy case continues, the more likely it is that Brinks Home Security\u2019s customers, dealers and suppliers would lose confidence in its ability to reorganize its businesses successfully and would seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nIt is not possible to predict the outcome of any bankruptcy case that may occur. In the event of a bankruptcy case, there can be no assurance that Brinks Home Security would be able to restructure as a going concern or successfully propose or confirm a plan of reorganization that provides for the continuation of the business post-bankruptcy. Further, it is possible that our equity interests in Brinks Home Security would be canceled and extinguished with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and we would not be entitled to receive, and would not receive or retain, any property or interest in Brinks Home Security on account of such equity interests. Consequently, a case in Bankruptcy Court, or the potential for such a case, may result in increased volatility in the trading price of our common stock and, ultimately, the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, any trading in shares of our common stock during, or prior to any anticipated, Brinks Home Security Bankruptcy Court case is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of shares of our common stock.\nBrinks Home Security faces risks in acquiring and integrating new subscribers.\nThe acquisition of AMAs involves a number of risks, including the risk that the AMAs acquired may not be profitable due to higher than expected account attrition, lower than expected revenues from the AMAs, higher than expected costs for the creation of new subscribers or monitoring accounts or, when applicable, lower than expected recoveries from dealers. The cost incurred to acquire an AMA is affected by the monthly recurring revenue generated by the AMA, as well as several other factors, including the level of competition, prior experience with AMAs acquired from the dealer, the number of AMAs acquired, the subscriber's credit score and the type of security equipment used by the subscriber. To the extent that the servicing costs or the attrition rates are higher than expected or the revenues from the AMAs or, when applicable, the recoveries from dealers are lower than expected, Brinks Home Security's business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBrinks Home Security's customer generation strategies and the competitive market for customer accounts may affect its future profitability.\nA significant element of Brinks Home Security's business strategy is the generation of new customer accounts through its Dealer Channel, which accounted for a substantial portion of Brinks Home Security's new customer accounts for the year ended December 31, 2018. Brinks Home Security's future operating results will depend in large part on its ability to manage its generation strategies effectively. Although Brinks Home Security currently generates accounts through hundreds of authorized dealers, a significant portion of its accounts originate from a smaller number of dealers. Brinks Home Security experiences a loss of dealers from its dealer network due to various factors, such as dealers becoming inactive or discontinuing their alarm monitoring business and competition from other alarm monitoring companies. If Brinks Home Security experiences a loss of dealers representing a significant portion of its account generation engine or if Brinks Home Security is unable to replace or recruit dealers in accordance with its business plans, Brinks Home Security's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn recent years, Brinks Home Security's acquisition of new customer accounts through its Dealer Channel has declined due to the attrition of large dealers, efforts to acquire new accounts from dealers at lower purchase prices, consumer buying behaviors, including trends of buying security products through online sources and increased competition from technology, telecommunications and cable companies in the market. Brinks Home Security is increasingly reliant on its Direct to Consumer Channel and strategic relationships with third parties, such as Nest, to counter-balance this declining account generation through its Dealer Channel. If Brinks Home Security is unable to generate sufficient accounts through its Direct to Consumer Channel and strategic relationships to replace declining new accounts through dealers, Brinks Home Security's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nBrinks Home Security relies on a significant number of its subscribers remaining with it for an extended period of time.\nBrinks Home Security incurs significant upfront costs for each new subscriber. Brinks Home Security requires a substantial amount of time, typically exceeding the initial term of the related AMA, to receive cash payments (net of variable cash operating costs) from a particular subscriber that are sufficient to offset this upfront cost. Accordingly, Brinks Home Security's long-term performance is dependent on Brinks Home Security's subscribers remaining with it for as long as possible. This requires Brinks Home Security to minimize its rate of subscriber cancellations, or attrition. Factors that can increase cancellations include subscribers who relocate and do not reconnect, prolonged downturns in the housing market, problems with service quality, competition from other alarm monitoring companies, equipment obsolescence, adverse economic conditions, conversion of wireless spectrums and the affordability of Brinks Home Security's service. If Brinks Home Security fails to keep its subscribers for a sufficiently long period of time, attrition rates would be higher than expected and Brinks Home Security's financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, Brinks Home Security may experience higher attrition rates with respect to subscribers acquired in bulk buys than subscribers acquired pursuant to Brinks Home Security's authorized dealer program.\nBrinks Home Security is subject to credit risk and other risks associated with its subscribers.\nSubstantially all of Brinks Home Security's revenues are derived from the recurring monthly revenue due from subscribers under the AMAs. Therefore, Brinks Home Security is dependent on the ability and willingness of subscribers to pay amounts due under the AMAs on a monthly basis in a timely manner. Although subscribers are contractually obligated to pay amounts due under an AMA and are generally prohibited from canceling the AMA for the initial term of the AMA, subscribers' payment obligations are unsecured, which could impair Brinks Home Security's ability to collect any unpaid amounts from its subscribers. To the extent payment defaults by subscribers under the AMAs are greater than anticipated, Brinks Home Security's business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are also exploring different pricing plans for our products and services, including larger up-front payments and consumer financing options for residential equipment purchases. We currently have arrangements with a third-party financing company to\nprovide financing to customers who wish to finance their equipment purchases from us. These financing arrangements could increase the credit risks associated with our subscribers and any efforts to mitigate risk may not be sufficient to prevent our results of operations from being materially adversely affected.\nBrinks Home Security is subject to credit risk and other risks associated with its dealers.\nUnder the standard alarm monitoring contract acquisition agreements that Brinks Home Security enters into with its dealers, if a subscriber terminates their service with Brinks Home Security during the first twelve months after the AMA has been acquired, the dealer is typically required to elect between substituting another AMA for the terminating AMA or compensating Brinks Home Security in an amount based on the original acquisition cost of the terminating AMA. Brinks Home Security is subject to the risk that dealers will breach their obligation to provide a comparable substitute AMA for a terminating AMA. Although Brinks Home Security withholds specified amounts from the acquisition cost paid to dealers for AMAs (\"holdback\"), which may be used to satisfy or offset these and other applicable dealer obligations under the alarm monitoring contract acquisition agreements, there can be no guarantee that these amounts will be sufficient to satisfy or offset the full extent of the default by a dealer of its obligations under its agreement. If the holdback does prove insufficient to cover dealer obligations, Brinks Home Security is also subject to the credit risk that the dealers may not have sufficient funds to compensate Brinks Home Security or that any such dealer will otherwise breach its obligation to compensate Brinks Home Security for a terminating AMA. To the extent defaults by dealers of the obligations under their agreements are greater than anticipated, Brinks Home Security's financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, a significant portion of Brinks Home Security's accounts originate from a small number of dealers. If any of these dealers discontinue their alarm monitoring business or cease operations altogether as a result of business conditions or due to increasingly burdensome regulatory compliance, the dealer may breach its obligations under the applicable alarm monitoring contract acquisition agreement and, to the extent such dealer has originated a significant portion of Brinks Home Security's accounts, Brinks Home Security's financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to a greater degree than if the dealer had originated a smaller number of accounts.\nAn inability to provide the contracted monitoring service could adversely affect Brinks Home Security's business.\nA disruption to the main monitoring facility, the back-up monitoring facility and/or third party monitoring facility could affect Brinks Home Security's ability to provide alarm monitoring services to its subscribers. Brinks Home Security's main monitoring facility holds Underwriter Laboratories listings as a protective signaling services station and maintains certain standards of building integrity, redundant computer and communications facilities and backup power, among other safeguards. However, no assurance can be given that Brinks Home Security's main monitoring facility will not be disrupted by a technical failure, including communication or hardware failures, catastrophic event or natural disaster, fire, weather, malicious acts or terrorism. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that Brinks Home Security's back-up or third party monitoring center will not be disrupted by the same or a simultaneous event or that it will be able to perform effectively in the event its main monitoring center is disrupted. Any such disruption, particularly one of a prolonged duration, could have a material adverse effect on Brinks Home Security's business.\nBrinks Home Security relies on third parties to transmit signals to its monitoring facilities and provide other services to its subscribers.\nBrinks Home Security relies on various third party telecommunications providers and signal processing centers to transmit and communicate signals to its monitoring facilities in a timely and consistent manner. These telecommunications providers and signal processing centers could fail to transmit or communicate these signals to the monitoring facility for many reasons, including due to disruptions from fire, natural disasters, weather, transmission interruption, malicious acts or terrorism. The failure of one or more of these telecommunications providers or signal processing centers to transmit and communicate signals to the monitoring facility in a timely manner could affect Brinks Home Security's ability to provide alarm monitoring, home automation and interactive services to its subscribers. Brinks Home Security also relies on third party technology companies to provide home automation and interactive services to its subscribers, including video surveillance services. These technology companies could fail to provide these services consistently, or at all, which could result in Brinks Home Security's inability to meet customer demand and damage its reputation. There can be no assurance that third-party telecommunications providers, signal processing centers and other technology companies will continue to transmit, communicate signals to the monitoring facilities or provide home automation and interactive services to subscribers without disruption. Any such disruption, particularly one of a prolonged duration, could have a material adverse effect on Brinks Home Security's business. See also \"Shifts in customer choice of, or telecommunications providers' support for, telecommunications services and equipment could adversely impact Brinks Home Security's business and require significant capital expenditures\" below with respect to risks associated with changes in signal transmissions.\nBrinks Home Security's reputation as a service provider of high quality security offerings may be adversely affected by product defects or shortfalls in customer service.\nBrinks Home Security's business depends on its reputation and ability to maintain good relationships with its subscribers, dealers and local regulators, among others. Its reputation may be harmed either through product defects, such as the failure of one or more of its subscribers' alarm systems, or shortfalls in customer service. Subscribers generally judge Brinks Home Security's performance through their interactions with the staff at the monitoring and customer care centers, dealers and technicians who perform on-site maintenance services. Any failure to meet subscribers' expectations in such customer service areas could cause an increase in attrition rates or make it difficult to recruit new subscribers. Any harm to Brinks Home Security's reputation or subscriber relationships caused by the actions of its staff at the monitoring and customer care centers, dealers, personnel or third party service providers or any other factors could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the ever-changing threat landscape, Brinks Home Security's products may be subject to potential vulnerabilities of wireless and Internet-of-things devices and its services may be subject to certain risks, including hacking or other unauthorized access to control or view systems and obtain private information.\nCompanies that collect and retain sensitive and confidential information are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. While Brinks Home Security implements security measures within its products, services, operations and systems, those measures may not prevent cybersecurity breaches, the access, capture or alteration of information by criminals, the exposure or exploitation of potential security vulnerabilities, distributed denial of service attacks, the installation of malware or ransomware, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced data or data loss that could be detrimental to its reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Third parties, including Brinks Home Security's dealers, partners and vendors, could also be a source of security risk to it in the event of a failure of their own products, components, networks, security systems, and infrastructure. In addition, we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access Brinks Home Security's products and services.\nA significant actual or perceived (whether or not valid) theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, employee, or other personally identifiable data, whether by Brinks Home Security, its partners and vendors, or other third parties, or as a result of employee error or malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with applicable industry standards or Brinks Home Security\u2019s contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data, or a violation of its privacy and information security policies with respect to such data, could result in costs, fines, litigation, or regulatory actions against Brinks Home Security. Such an event could additionally result in unfavorable publicity and therefore materially and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of the security and reliability of Brinks Home Security\u2019s services and its credibility and reputation with its customers, which may lead to customer dissatisfaction and could result in lost sales and increased customer revenue attrition.\nIn addition, Brinks Home Security depends on its information technology infrastructure for business-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Security breaches of, or sustained attacks against, this infrastructure could create system disruptions and shutdowns that could negatively impact its operations. Increasingly, Brinks Home Security\u2019s products and services are accessed through the Internet, and security breaches in connection with the delivery of its services via the Internet may affect it and could be detrimental to its reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition. Brinks Home Security continues to invest in new and emerging technology and other solutions to protect its network and information systems, but there can be no assurance that these investments and solutions will prevent any of the risks described above. While Brinks Home Security maintains cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party insurance coverages, its insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all of its losses from any future disruptions or breaches of its systems or other event as described above.\nPrivacy concerns, such as consumer identity theft and security breaches, could hurt Brinks Home Security's reputation and revenues.\nAs part of its operations, Brinks Home Security collects a large amount of private information from its subscribers, including social security numbers, credit card information, images and voice recordings. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to Brinks Home Security's systems or facilities by, among other things, hacking into Brinks Home Security's systems or facilities or those of Brinks Home Security's customers, partners or vendors, or through fraud or other means of deceiving Brinks Home Security's employees, partners or vendors. In addition, hardware, software or applications Brinks Home Security develops or obtains from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The techniques used to gain such access to Brinks Home Security's information technology systems, Brinks Home Security's data or customers' data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are constantly\nevolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Brinks Home Security has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, but as with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. If Brinks Home Security were to experience a breach of its data security, it may put private information of its subscribers at risk of exposure. To the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or identity theft, Brinks Home Security may experience a general decline in consumer confidence in its business, which may lead to an increase in attrition rates or may make it more difficult to attract new subscribers. If consumers become reluctant to use Brinks Home Security's services because of concerns over data privacy or credit card fraud, Brinks Home Security's ability to generate revenues would be impaired. In addition, if technology upgrades or other expenditures are required to prevent security breaches of its network, boost general consumer confidence in its business, or prevent credit card fraud and identity theft, Brinks Home Security may be required to make unplanned capital expenditures or expend other resources. Any such loss of confidence in Brinks Home Security's business or additional capital expenditure requirement could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBrinks Home Security's independent, third-party authorized dealers may not be able to mitigate certain risks such as information technology breaches, data security breaches, product liability, errors and omissions, and marketing compliance.\nBrinks Home Security generates a portion of its new customers through its authorized dealer network. Brinks Home Security relies on independent, third-party authorized dealers to implement mitigation plans for certain risks they may experience, including but not limited to, information technology breaches, data security breaches, product liability, errors and omissions, and marketing compliance. If Brinks Home Security's authorized dealers experience any of these risks, or fail to implement mitigation plans for their risks, or if such implemented mitigation plans are inadequate or fail, it may be susceptible to risks associated with its authorized dealers on which it relies to generate customers. Any interruption or permanent disruption in the generation of customer accounts or services provided by Brinks Home Security's authorized dealers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nShifts in customer choice of, or telecommunications providers' support for, telecommunications services and equipment could adversely impact Brink Home Security's business and require significant capital expenditures.\nSubstantially all of Brinks Home Security's subscriber alarm systems use either cellular service or traditional land-line to communicate alarm signals from the subscribers\u2019 locations to its monitoring facilities. The number of land-line customers has continued to decline as fewer new customers utilize land-lines and consumers give up their land-line and exclusively use cellular and IP communication technology in their homes and businesses. As land-line and cellular network service is discontinued or disconnected, subscribers with alarm systems that communicate over these networks may need to have certain equipment in their security system replaced to maintain their monitoring service. The process of changing out this equipment may require Brinks Home Security to subsidize the replacement of subscribers' outdated equipment and is likely to cause an increase in subscriber attrition. For example, certain cellular carriers recently announced that they plan to retire their 3G and CDMA networks by the end of 2022, and Brinks Home Security currently estimates that the retirement of these networks will impact approximately 510,000 of its subscribers. Brinks Home Security is working on plans to identify and offer equipment upgrades to this population of subscribers. While such plans are not finalized, Brinks Home Security does expect to incur incremental costs over the next three years related to the retirement of 3G and CDMA networks. Total costs for the conversion of such customers are subject to numerous variables, including Brinks Home Security's ability to work with its partners and subscribers on cost sharing initiatives. If Brinks Home Security is unable to adapt timely to changing technologies, market conditions, customer preferences, or convert a substantial portion of its current 3G and CDMA subscribers before the 2022 retirement of these networks, its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nBrinks Home Security's business is subject to technological innovation over time.\nBrinks Home Security's monitoring services depend upon the technology (both hardware and software) of security alarm systems located at subscribers' premises as well as information technology networks and systems, including Internet and Internet-based or \"cloud\" computing services, to collect, process, transmit, and store electronic information. Brinks Home Security may be required to implement new technology both to attract and retain subscribers or in response to changes in technology or other factors, which could require significant expenditures. Such changes could include making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality, and implementing new systems. There are inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and changing these systems and implementing new systems, including potential disruption of Brinks Home Security's sales, operations and customer service functions, potential disruption of Brinks Home Security's internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating\nexpenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into Brinks Home Security's current systems. In addition, Brinks Home Security's technology system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. The implementation of new technology systems may also cause disruptions in Brinks Home Security's business operations and have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flows, and results of operations.\nFurther, the availability of any new features developed for use in Brinks Home Security's industry (whether developed by Brinks Home Security or otherwise) can have a significant impact on a subscriber\u2019s initial decision to choose Brinks Home Security's or its competitor\u2019s products and a subscriber's decision to renew with Brinks Home Security or switch to one of its competitors. To the extent its competitors have greater capital and other resources to dedicate to responding to technological innovation over time, the products and services offered by Brinks Home Security may become less attractive to current or future subscribers thereby reducing demand for such products and services and increasing attrition over time. Those competitors that benefit from more capital being available to them may be at a particular advantage to Brinks Home Security in this respect. If Brinks Home Security is unable to adapt in response to changing technologies, market conditions or customer requirements in a timely manner, such inability could adversely affect its business by increasing its rate of subscriber attrition. Brinks Home Security also faces potential competition from improvements in self-monitoring systems, which enable current or future subscribers to monitor their home environments without third-party involvement, which could further increase attrition rates over time and hinder the acquisition of new AMAs.\nThe high level of competition in Brinks Home Security's industry could adversely affect its business.\nThe security alarm monitoring industry is highly competitive and fragmented. As of December 31, 2018, Brinks Home Security was one of the largest alarm monitoring companies in the U.S. when measured by the total number of subscribers under contract. Brinks Home Security faces competition from other alarm monitoring companies, including companies that have more capital and that may offer higher prices and more favorable terms to dealers for AMAs or charge lower prices to customers for monitoring services. Brinks Home Security also faces competition from a significant number of small regional competitors that concentrate their capital and other resources in targeting local markets and forming new marketing channels that may displace the existing alarm system dealer channels for acquiring AMAs. Further, Brinks Home Security is facing increasing competition from telecommunications, cable and technology companies who are expanding into alarm monitoring services and bundling their existing offerings with monitored security services. The existing access to and relationship with subscribers that these companies have could give them a substantial advantage over Brinks Home Security, especially if they are able to offer subscribers a lower price by bundling these services. Any of these forms of competition could reduce the acquisition opportunities available to Brinks Home Security, thus slowing its rate of growth, or requiring it to increase the price paid for subscriber accounts, thus reducing its return on investment and negatively impacting its revenues and results of operations.\nRisks of liability from Brinks Home Security's business and operations may be significant.\nThe nature of the services Brinks Home Security provides potentially exposes it to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failures than may be inherent in other businesses. If subscribers believe that they incurred losses as a result of an action or failure to act by Brinks Home Security, the subscribers (or their insurers) could bring claims against Brinks Home Security, and Brinks Home Security has been subject to lawsuits of this type from time to time. Similarly, if dealers believe that they incurred losses or were denied rights under the alarm monitoring contract acquisition agreements as a result of an action or failure to act by Brinks Home Security, the dealers could bring claims against Brinks Home Security. Although substantially all of Brinks Home Security's AMAs and alarm monitoring contract acquisition agreements contain provisions limiting its liability to subscribers and dealers, respectively, in an attempt to reduce this risk, the AMAs or alarm monitoring contract acquisition agreements that do not contain such provisions expose Brinks Home Security to risks of liability that could materially and adversely affect its business. Moreover, even when such provisions are included in an AMA or alarm monitoring contract acquisition agreement, in the event of any such litigation, no assurance can be given that these limitations will be enforced, and the costs of such litigation or the related settlements or judgments could have a material adverse effect on Brinks Home Security's financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that Brinks Home Security is adequately insured for these risks. Certain of its insurance policies and the laws of some states may limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages or liability arising from gross negligence. If significant uninsured damages are assessed against Brinks Home Security, the resulting liability could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture litigation could result in reputational damage for Brinks Home Security.\nIn the ordinary course of business, from time to time, Brinks Home Security and its subsidiaries are the subject of complaints or litigation from subscribers or inquiries or investigations from government officials, sometimes related to alleged violations of state or federal consumer protection statutes (including by its dealers), violations of \"false alarm\" ordinances or other regulations, negligent dealer installation or negligent service of alarm monitoring systems. Brinks Home Security may also be subject to employee claims based on, among other things, alleged discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination claims. In addition to diverting management resources, damage resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect Brinks Home Security's reputation in the communities it services, regardless of whether such allegations are unfounded. Such reputational damage could result in higher attrition rates and greater difficulty in attracting new subscribers on terms that are attractive to Brinks Home Security or at all.\nA loss of experienced employees could adversely affect Brinks Home Security.\nThe success of Brinks Home Security has been largely dependent upon the active participation of its officers and employees. The loss of the services of key members of its management for any reason may have a material adverse effect on its operations and the ability to maintain and grow its business. Brinks Home Security depends on the managerial skills and expertise of its management and employees to provide customer service by, among other things, monitoring and responding to alarm signals, coordinating equipment repairs, administering billing and collections under the AMAs and administering and providing dealer services under the contract acquisition agreements. There is no assurance that Brinks Home Security will be able to retain its current management and other experienced employees or replace them satisfactorily to the extent they leave its employ. The loss of Brinks Home Security's experienced employees' services and expertise could materially and adversely affect Brinks Home Security's business.\nThe alarm monitoring business is subject to macroeconomic factors that may negatively impact Brinks Home Security's results of operations, including prolonged downturns in the economy.\nThe alarm monitoring business is dependent in part on national, regional and local economic conditions. In particular, where disposable income available for discretionary spending is reduced (such as by higher housing, energy, interest or other costs or where the actual or perceived wealth of customers has decreased because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, increased foreclosure rates, inflation, increased tax rates or other economic disruptions), the alarm monitoring business could experience increased attrition rates and reduced consumer demand. In periods of economic downturn, no assurance can be given that Brinks Home Security will be able to continue acquiring quality AMAs or that it will not experience higher attrition rates. In addition, any deterioration in new construction and sales of existing single family homes could reduce opportunities to grow Brinks Home Security's subscriber accounts from the sales of new security systems and services and the take-over of existing security systems that had previously been monitored by its competitors. If there are prolonged durations of general economic downturn, Brinks Home Security's results of operations and subscriber account growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdverse economic conditions or natural disasters in states where Brinks Home Security's subscribers are more heavily concentrated may negatively impact Brinks Home Security's results of operations.\nEven as economic conditions may improve in the United States as a whole, this improvement may not occur or further deterioration may occur in the regions where Brinks Home Security's subscribers are more heavily concentrated such as, Texas, California, Florida and Arizona which, in the aggregate, comprise approximately 40% of Brinks Home Security's subscribers. Further, certain of these regions are more prone to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods or earthquakes. Although Brinks Home Security has a geographically diverse subscriber base, adverse conditions in one or more states where its business is more heavily concentrated could have a significant adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the insurance industry were to change its practice of providing incentives to homeowners for the use of alarm monitoring services, Brinks Home Security may experience a reduction in new customer growth or an increase in its subscriber attrition rate.\nIt has been common practice in the insurance industry to provide a reduction in rates for policies written on homes that have monitored alarm systems. There can be no assurance that insurance companies will continue to offer these rate reductions. If these incentives were reduced or eliminated, new homeowners who otherwise may not feel the need for alarm monitoring services would be removed from Brinks Home Security's potential customer pool, which could hinder the growth of its business, and existing subscribers may choose to disconnect or not renew their service contracts, which could increase Brinks\nHome Security's attrition rates. In either case Brinks Home Security's results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nBrinks Home Security's acquisition strategy may not be successful.\nBrinks Home Security may seek opportunities to grow free cash flow through strategic acquisitions, which may include leveraged acquisitions. However, there can be no assurance that Brinks Home Security will be able to invest its capital in acquisitions that are accretive to free cash flow which could negatively impact its growth. Brinks Home Security's ability to consummate such acquisitions may be negatively impacted by various factors, including among other things:\n\u2022\nfailure to identify attractive acquisition candidates on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other bidders;\n\u2022\ninability to raise any required financing; and\n\u2022\nantitrust or other regulatory restrictions, including any requirements that may be imposed by government agencies as a condition to any required regulatory approval.\nIf Brinks Home Security engages in any acquisition, it will incur a variety of costs, and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. If Brinks Home Security undertakes any acquisition, the process of operating such acquired business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including the assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of such acquired business and the possibility of litigation or other claims in connection with, or as a result of, such an acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties. Moreover, Brinks Home Security may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all, and it may experience increased attrition in its subscriber base and/or a loss of dealer or other strategic relationships and difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into its business or achieving anticipated operations efficiencies or cost savings. Future acquisitions could cause Brinks Home Security to incur debt and expose it to liabilities. Further, Brinks Home Security may incur significant expenditures and devote substantial management time and attention in anticipation of an acquisition that is never realized. Lastly, while it intends to implement appropriate controls and procedures as it integrates any acquired companies, Brinks Home Security may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of these companies' disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting within the time periods required by U.S. federal securities laws and regulations.\nBrinks Home Security may pursue business opportunities that diverge from its current business model, which may cause its business to suffer.\nBrinks Home Security may pursue business opportunities that diverge from its current business model, including expanding its products or service offerings, investing in new and unproven technologies, adding or modifying the focus of its customer acquisition channels and forming new alliances with companies to market its services. Brinks Home Security can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove to be successful. Among other negative effects, Brinks Home Security's pursuit of such business opportunities could cause its cost of investment in new customers to grow at a faster rate than its recurring revenue. Additionally, any new alliances or customer acquisition channels could have higher cost structures than Brinks Home Security's current arrangements, which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital. In the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow, Brinks Home Security might be required to draw on its Credit Facility or pursue other external financing, which may not be readily available. Further, new alliances or customer acquisition channels may also result in the cannibalization of Brinks Home Security's products, such as in the case of the alliance with Nest. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect Brinks Home Security's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThird party claims with respect to Brink Home Security's intellectual property, if decided against Brinks Home Security, may result in competing uses of Brinks Home Security's intellectual property or require the adoption of new, non-infringing intellectual property.\nBrinks Home Security has received and may in the future receive notices claiming it committed intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other intellectual property violations and third parties have claimed, and may, in the future, claim that Brinks Home Security does not own or have rights to use all intellectual property rights used in the conduct of its business. While Brinks Home Security does not believe that any of the claims it has previously received are material, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert future infringement claims against it or claim that its rights to its intellectual property are invalid or unenforceable, and Brinks Home Security cannot guarantee that these claims will be unsuccessful. The \"Brinks\" and \"Brinks Home Security\" trademarks are licensed from Brink's. While Brink's is required to defend its intellectual property rights related to the \"Brinks\" or \"Brinks Home Security\" trademarks, any claims involving rights to use the \"Brinks\"\nor \"Brinks Home Security\" trademarks could have a material adverse effect on Brinks Home Security's business if such claims were decided against Brink's and Brink's was precluded from using or licensing the \"Brinks\" or \"Brinks Home Security\" trademarks or others were allowed to use such trademarks. If Brinks Home Security was required to adopt a new name, it would entail marketing costs in connection with building up recognition and goodwill in such new name. In the event that Brinks Home Security was enjoined from using any of its other intellectual property, there would be costs associated with the replacement of such intellectual property with developed, acquired or licensed intellectual property. There would also be costs associated with the defense and settlement of any infringement or misappropriation allegations and any damages that may be awarded.\nFactors Relating to Regulatory Matters\nBrinks Home Security's business operates in a regulated industry.\nBrinks Home Security's business, operations and dealers are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local consumer protection laws, licensing regulation and other laws and regulations, and, to a lesser extent, similar Canadian laws and regulations. While there are no U.S. federal laws that directly regulate the security alarm monitoring industry, Brinks Home Security's advertising and sales practices and that of its dealer network are subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \"FTC\") in addition to state consumer protection laws. The FTC and the Federal Communications Commission have issued regulations that place restrictions on, among other things, unsolicited automated telephone calls to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems and the use of prerecorded or artificial voice messages. If Brinks Home Security (through its direct marketing efforts) or Brinks Home Security's dealers were to take actions in violation of these regulations, such as telemarketing to individuals on the \"Do Not Call\" registry, it could be subject to fines, penalties, private actions, investigations or enforcement actions by government regulators. Brinks Home Security has been named, and may be named in the future, as a defendant in litigation arising from alleged violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the \"TCPA\"). While Brinks Home Security endeavors to comply with the TCPA, no assurance can be given that Brinks Home Security will not be exposed to liability as a result of its or its dealers' direct marketing efforts or debt collections. For example, Brinks Home Security recognized a legal settlement reserve in the second quarter of 2017 related to a class action lawsuit based on alleged TCPA violations. In addition, although Brinks Home Security has taken steps to insulate itself from any such wrongful conduct by its dealers, and to require its dealers to comply with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that it will not be exposed to liability as result of its dealers' conduct. If Brinks Home Security or any such dealers do not comply with applicable laws, Brinks Home Security may be exposed to increased liability and penalties and there can be no assurance, in the event of such liability, that Brinks Home Security would be adequately covered, if at all, by its insurance policies. Further, to the extent that any changes in law or regulation further restrict the lead generation activity of Brinks Home Security or its dealers, these restrictions could result in a material reduction in subscriber acquisition opportunities, reducing the growth prospects of its business and adversely affecting its financial condition and future cash flows. In addition, most states in which Brinks Home Security operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the monitored security services industry. Brinks Home Security's business relies heavily upon wireline and cellular telephone service to communicate signals. Wireline and cellular telephone companies are currently regulated by both federal and state governments. Changes in laws or regulations could require Brinks Home Security to change the way it operates, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any such applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of its operating permits and licenses, including in geographic areas where its services have substantial penetration, which could adversely affect its business and financial condition. Further, if these laws and regulations were to change or Brinks Home Security failed to comply with such laws and regulations as they exist today or in the future, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreased adoption of statutes and governmental policies purporting to void automatic renewal provisions in AMAs, or purporting to characterize certain charges in the AMAs as unlawful, could adversely affect Brinks Home Security's business and operations.\nAMAs typically contain provisions automatically renewing the term of the contract at the end of the initial term, unless a cancellation notice is delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract. If the customer cancels prior to the end of the contract term, other than in accordance with the contract, Brinks Home Security may charge the customer an early cancellation fee as specified in the contract, which typically allows Brinks Home Security to charge 80% of the amounts that would have been paid over the remaining term of the contract. Several states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, consumer protection policies or legal precedents which purport to void or substantially limit the automatic renewal provisions of contracts such as the AMAs, or otherwise restrict the charges that can be imposed upon contract cancellation. Such initiatives could negatively impact Brinks Home Security's business. Adverse judicial determinations regarding these matters could increase legal exposure to customers against whom such charges have been imposed, and the risk that certain customers may seek to\nrecover such charges through litigation. In addition, the costs of defending such litigation and enforcement actions could have an adverse effect on Brinks Home Security's business and operations.\nFalse alarm ordinances could adversely affect Brinks Home Security's business and operations.\nSignificant concern has arisen in certain municipalities about the high incidence of false alarms. In some localities, this concern has resulted in local ordinances or policies that restrict police response to third-party monitored burglar alarms. In addition, an increasing number of local governmental authorities have considered or adopted various measures aimed at reducing the number of false alarms; measures include alarm fines to Brinks Home Security and/or our customers, limits on number of police responses allowed, and requiring certain alarm conditions to exist before a response is granted. In extreme situations, authorities may not respond to an alarm unless a verified problem exists.\nEnactment of these measures could adversely affect Brinks Home Security's future operations and business. Alarm monitoring companies operating in areas impacted by government alarm ordinances may choose to hire third-party guard firms to respond to an alarm. If Brinks Home Security needs to hire third-party guard firms, it could have a material adverse effect on its business through either increased servicing costs, which could negatively affect the ability to properly fund its ongoing operations, or increased costs to its customers, which may limit its ability to attract new customers or increase its subscriber attrition rates. In addition, the perception that police departments will not respond to monitored burglar alarms may reduce customer satisfaction or customer demand for an alarm monitoring service. Although Brinks Home Security currently has less than 80,000 subscribers in areas covered by these ordinances or policies, a more widespread adoption of policies of this nature could adversely affect its business.\nFactors Relating to Our Common Stock and Convertible Notes\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may decline in the future.\nOur common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past. For example, during 2018, our Series A common stock price fluctuated from a high of $12.23 to a low of $0.25. Investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price at which they were purchased. The market price of our common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future depending upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Factors that could affect our stock price and trading volume include, among others, the ability, or perceived ability, of our Company and Brinks Home Security to continue as going concerns, the ability of Brinks Home Security to obtain or maintain any requested waiver or forbearance with respect to the Credit Facility and Senior Notes, potential restructurings and strategic transactions with respect to Brinks Home Security, the delisting of our Series A common stock from Nasdaq, the perceived prospects of our business; differences between anticipated and actual operating results; changes in analysts' recommendations or projections; the commencement and/or results of litigation and other legal proceedings; and future sales of our common stock by us or by significant shareholders, officers and directors. In addition, stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume volatility from time to time, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our performance.\nBrinks Home Security may be subject to United States Bankruptcy Court proceedings in the near future, which would have an adverse effect on our common stock.\nSee \"Brinks Home Security may be subject to United States Bankruptcy Court proceedings in the near future, which would pose significant risks to its business and to its and our investors\" above for a discussion of the impact on our common stock if Brinks Home Security became subject to United States Bankruptcy Court proceedings.\nOur Series A Common Stock could be delisted, which could have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for our shareholders to sell our common stock.\nOur Series A Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As a Nasdaq listed company, we are required to satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nOn November 26, 2018, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that the market value of publicly held shares of our Series A common stock (\u201cMVPHS\u201d) for the last 30 consecutive business days was less than $15 million, which is the minimum market value of publicly held shares (the \u201cMVPHS Requirement\u201d) necessary to qualify for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(3)(C). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), we have been provided 180 calendar days, or until May 28, 2019, to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement. To regain compliance, our MVPHS must be at least $15 million for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period, at which point Nasdaq would provide written confirmation to us and close the matter. If we do not regain compliance with the\nMVPHS Requirement within the 180-day compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice to us that our Series A common stock is subject to delisting. We may transfer our Series A common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market, provided we meet the listing requirements for that market, but there can be no assurance that we will meet those listing requirements.\nIn addition, on December 28, 2018, we received a letter (the \u201cMinimum Bid Notice\u201d) from Nasdaq indicating that the closing bid price of our Series A common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days was less than $1.00, which is the minimum closing bid price (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d) necessary to qualify for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been provided 180 calendar days, or until June 26, 2019, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our Series A common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period, at which point Nasdaq would provide written confirmation to the Company of compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and close the matter. The Minimum Bid Notice provides that, if we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by June 26, 2019, we may be eligible to transfer to the Nasdaq Capital Market and take advantage of an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To qualify, we would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and provide written notice of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse split, if necessary. If we meet these requirements, we will be granted an additional compliance period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, but there can be no assurance that we will meet those listing requirements. If we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by June 26, 2019, and the Nasdaq staff determines that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are not otherwise eligible for any additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that our Series A common stock is subject to delisting.\nWhile Nasdaq\u2019s rules permit us to appeal any delisting determination, there can be no assurance the Nasdaq\u2019s staff would grant our request for continued listing. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the MVPHS Requirement or the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s other continued listing requirements.\nIn addition, a delisting of our Series A Common Stock from Nasdaq would negatively impact us because it could, among other things: (i) reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reduce the amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; (iii) reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing and the ability of our shareholders to sell our common stock; (iv) limit our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets; (v) impair our ability to provide liquid equity incentives to our employees; and (vi) have negative reputational impact for us with our customers, suppliers, employees and other persons with whom we transact from time to time.\nIf our Series A Common Stock ceases to be listed on at least one U. S. national securities exchange, such cessation would trigger a fundamental change under the Indenture governing our outstanding Convertible Notes, which would give holders of our convertible notes the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the outstanding convertible notes.\nIf our Series A Common Stock ceases to be listed on at least one U.S. national securities exchange, such cessation would constitute a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d as such term is defined in the indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) governing our Convertible Notes. As a result, each holder of the remaining Convertible Notes would have the right, at such noteholder\u2019s option, to require Ascent Capital to repurchase for cash all or a portion of such noteholder\u2019s Convertible Notes on the repurchase date specified by Ascent Capital in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, including any unpaid \u201cadditional interest\u201d (as such term is defined in the Indenture) to, but excluding, the \u201cfundamental change repurchase date\u201d (as such term is defined in the Indenture). We may not have sufficient funds, or be able to obtain financing, to pay the fundamental change repurchase price if we are required to repurchase the Convertible Notes. A failure to pay the fundamental change repurchase price if we are required to repurchase the Convertible Notes would constitute an event of default under the Indenture. If an event of default occurs under the Indenture, either the trustee under the Indenture or the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes then outstanding in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture may accelerate the due date of the entire outstanding principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid interest and accrued and unpaid additional interest on all the Convertible Notes, to be due and payable immediately.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company that our shareholders may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\na capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share, and a Series C that, except in such limited circumstances as may be required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nclassifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest or exercise of voting rights;\n\u2022\nlimiting who may call special meetings of shareholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting shareholder action by written consent (subject to certain exceptions), thereby requiring such action to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nrequiring shareholder approval by holders of at least 80% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our Company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nrequiring the consent of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Series B common stock (voting as a separate class) to certain share distributions and other corporate actions in which the voting power of the Series B common stock would be diluted, for example by issuing shares having multiple votes per share as a dividend to holders of Series A common stock; and\n\u2022\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, Brinks Home Security's Credit Facility provides that the occurrence of specified change of control events will result in an event of default thereunder, and the Senior Notes include a covenant that requires Brinks Home Security to make an offer to purchase all outstanding Senior Notes, at 101% of par, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, each of which could cause an acquisition of our Company to be prohibitively expensive for a potential bidder.\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our shareholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common shareholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of shareholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.\nAlthough our Series B common stock trades on the OTC Markets, there is no meaningful trading market for the stock.\nOur Series B common stock is not widely held, with 95% of the outstanding shares as of December 31, 2018 beneficially owned by John C. Malone, a former director of the Company, and William Fitzgerald, Ascent Capital's Chairman of the Board. Although it is quoted on the OTC Markets, it is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market. The OTC Markets tends to be highly illiquid, in part, because there is no national quotation system by which potential investors can track the market price of shares except through information received or generated by a limited number of broker-dealers that make markets in particular stocks. There is also a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the OTC Markets as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system. This volatility is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of readily available price quotations, lower trading volume, absence of consistent administrative supervision of \"bid\" and \"ask\" quotations, and market conditions. Each share of the Series B common stock is convertible, at any time at the option of the holder, into one share of Series A common stock, which is listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"ASCMA.\"\nFactors Relating to Ascent Capital and Its Corporate History and Structure\nWe have a history of losses and may incur losses in the future.\nBrinks Home Security, our primary operating subsidiary, incurred losses in each of its last five fiscal years. In future periods, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent quarterly or annual basis. Failure to maintain profitability in future periods may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAscent Capital is a holding company and derives substantially all of its revenue and cash flow from its primary operating subsidiary, Brinks Home Security.\nBrinks Home Security is a separate and independent legal entity and has no obligation to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of Brinks Home Security to pay dividends to us is subject to, among other things, compliance with covenants in its Credit Facility and Senior Note indenture, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds, and applicable state laws. As of December 31, 2018, Brinks Home Security had principal indebtedness of $1,804,450,000. Claims of other creditors of Brinks Home Security have priority as to its assets over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders. In addition, as of April 1, 2019, Ascent Capital had $260,000 aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Convertible Notes. Although we believe we currently have sufficient cash reserves at the Company to service our obligations under the Convertible Notes, our sources of cash remain limited as a result of our holding company structure and the restrictions on Brinks Home Security's ability to distribute cash to our Company.\nAn inability to access capital markets at attractive rates could materially increase our expenses.\nWe may in the future require access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for investments and expenditures. In any such event, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If our ability to access required capital were to become significantly constrained, we could incur material borrowing costs, our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 92777, "SIC": 7380, "TIC": "ASCMA"}
