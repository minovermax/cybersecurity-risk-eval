RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect, our operations. You should carefully consider these risks. These risks are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or any combination of the foregoing could be materially and adversely affected.\n- 5 -\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe cannot predict with certainty the future evolution of the IT infrastructure market in which we compete, and may be unable to respond effectively or on a timely basis to rapid technological change.\nThe IT infrastructure market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, industry standards and customer needs, as well as by frequent new product and service introductions. Innovative new IT technologies and evolving industry standards have the potential to become the \u201cnew normal,\u201d either replacing or providing efficient, potentially lower-cost alternatives to other, more traditional, IT communications services. The adoption of such new technologies or industry standards could render our existing services obsolete and unmarketable or require us to spend significant amounts of capital to adapt or adopt new technologies or industry standards.\nOur failure to anticipate new technology trends that may eventually become the preferred technology choice of our customers, to adapt our technology to any changes in the prevailing industry standards (or, conversely, for there to be an absence of generally accepted standards applicable to the industries we compete in) could materially and adversely affect our business. Our pursuit of and investment in necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense, but will not guarantee that we can successfully adapt our network and services to alternative access devices and technologies. Technological advances in computer processing, storage, capacity, component size, cloud computing solutions or power management could result in a decreased demand for our data center and hosting services. Likewise, if the Internet backbone becomes subject to a form of central management or gatekeeping control, or if ISPs establish an economic settlement arrangement regarding the exchange of traffic between Internet networks that is passed on to Internet users, the demand for our IP and CDN services could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to develop new and enhanced services and products that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable to improve the performance and features of our existing services and products or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we compete are constantly evolving. The process of expending research and development funds to create new services and products, and the technologies that support them is expensive, time and labor intensive and uncertain. We may not understand or accurately assess the market demand for new services and products or not be able to solve or fix technical problems with new services and products. The demand for top research and development talent is high, and there is significant competition for these scarce resources.\nOur future success may depend on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by expending research and development funds in a cost-effective manner to acquire talent and to develop and introduce new services, products and upgrades on a timely basis. New product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u25cf developing or expanding efficient sales channels;\n\u25cf sourcing, identifying, obtaining and maintaining qualified research and development staff with the appropriate skill and expertise;\n\u25cf managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements;\n\u25cf identifying and adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors\u2019 and customers\u2019 services and products;\n\u25cf entering into new or unproven markets where we have limited experience;\n\u25cf managing new service and product service strategies and integrating them with our existing services and products;\n\u25cf incorporating acquired products and technologies;\n\u25cf trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new products to international markets; and\n\u25cf obtaining required technology licenses and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products.\nIn addition, if we cannot innovate our products or adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends, our revenue could be negatively impacted. If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new services, products and upgrades are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, we may experience a material decrease in our revenues and earnings.\nFailure to retain existing customers or attract new customers will cause our revenue to decline.\nIn addition to adding new customers, we must sell additional services to existing customers and encourage them to increase their usage levels to increase our revenue. If our existing and prospective customers do not perceive our services to be of sufficiently high value and quality or do not provide the proper technological solutions, we may not be able to retain our current customers or attract new ones. Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our services after the expiration of their initial commitment, and these agreements may not be renewed at the same price or level of service, if at all. Due to the upfront costs of implementing IT infrastructure services, if our customers do not renew or cancel their agreements, we may not be able to recover the initial costs associated with bringing additional IT infrastructure on-line.\n- 6 -\nOur customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf their level of satisfaction with our services;\n\u25cf our ability to provide features and functionality demanded by our customers;\n\u25cf the prices of our services compared to our competitors;\n\u25cf technological advances that allow customers to meet their needs with fewer infrastructure resources;\n\u25cf mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base; which include a significant number of technology customers that are potentially attractive acquisition targets; and\n\u25cf reduction in our customers\u2019 spending levels or economic decline in our customer\u2019s markets.\nIf our customers do not renew their agreements with us or if they renew on less favorable terms, our revenue would decline and our business may suffer. Similarly, our customer agreements may provide for minimum commitments that may be significantly below our customers\u2019 historical usage levels. Consequently, these customers could significantly curtail their usage without incurring any incremental fees under our agreements. In this event, our revenue would be lower than expected and our operating results could suffer.\nOur capital investment strategy for data center and IT infrastructure services expansion may contain erroneous assumptions causing our return on invested capital to be materially lower than expected and could materially impact our results of operations.\nOur strategic decision to invest capital in expanding our data center and IT infrastructure services is based on, among other things, significant assumptions related to expected growth of these markets, our IT solutions program, our competitors\u2019 plans and current and expected server utilization and data center occupancy rates. We have no way of ensuring the data or models we use to deploy capital into existing markets, or to create new markets, has been or will be accurate. Errors or imprecision in these estimates, especially those related to customer demand or our competitors\u2019 plans, could cause actual results to differ materially from our expected results and could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience difficulties in executing our capital investment strategy to expand our IT infrastructure services, upgrade existing facilities or establish new facilities, products, services or capabilities.\nAs part of our strategy, we may continue to expand our IT infrastructure services and may encounter challenges and difficulties in implementing our expansion plans. This could cause us to grow at a slower pace than projected in our capital investment modeling. These challenges and difficulties relate to our ability to:\n\u25cf identify and obtain the use of locations meeting our selection criteria on competitive terms;\n\u25cf estimate costs and control delays;\n\u25cf obtain necessary permits on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u25cf generate sufficient cash flow from operations or through current or additional debt or equity financings to support these expansion plans;\n\u25cf establish key relationships with IT infrastructure providers;\n\u25cf hire, train, retain and manage sufficient operational and technical employees and supporting personnel;\n\u25cf obtain the necessary power density and supply from local utility companies;\n\u25cf avoid labor issues impacting our suppliers, such as a strike; and\n\u25cf identify and obtain contractors that will not default on the agreed upon contract performance.\nIf we encounter greater than anticipated difficulties in implementing our expansion plans, are unable to deploy new IT infrastructure services or do not adequately control expenses associated with the deployment of new IT infrastructure services, it may be necessary to take additional actions, which could divert management\u2019s attention and strain our operational and financial resources. We may not successfully address any or all of these challenges, and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur estimation of future data center space needs may be inaccurate, leading to missed sales opportunities or additional expenses through unnecessary carrying costs.\nAdding data center space involves capital outlays well ahead of planned usage. Although we believe we can accurately project future space needs in particular markets, these plans require significant estimates and assumptions based on available market data. Errors or imprecision in these estimates or the data on which the estimates are based could result in either an oversupply or undersupply of space in a particular market and cause actual results to differ materially from our expected results and correspondingly have a material adverse impact on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n- 7 -\nPricing pressure may continue to decrease our revenue for certain services.\nPricing for Internet connectivity, data transit and data storage services has declined in recent years and may continue to decline, which would continue to impact our IP services segment. By bundling their services and reducing the overall cost of their service offerings, certain of our competitors may be able to provide customers with reduced costs in connection with their Internet connectivity, data transit and data storage services or private network services, thereby significantly increasing the pressure on us to decrease our prices, whether unbundled or bundled. Increased price competition, price deflation and other related competitive pressures have eroded, and could continue to erode, our revenue and margins and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to control or reduce our costs. Because we rely on ISPs to deliver our services and have agreed with some of these providers to purchase minimum amounts of service at predetermined prices, our profitability could be adversely affected by competitive price reductions offered to our customers even if accompanied with an increased number of customers.\nSome of our competitors for data center services may adopt aggressive pricing policies. Many of our competitors for cloud services have substantially greater financial resources and may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the promotion, marketing and sales of their services. Such competitive actions could cause us to lower prices for certain products or services to remain competitive in the market. In addition, we have seen and may continue to see increased competition for colocation services from wholesale data center providers, such as large real estate companies. Rather than leasing available space to large single tenants, wholesale data center providers may decide to convert the space instead to smaller units designed for retail colocation use. As a result of such competition, we could suffer from downward pricing pressure and the loss of customers, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market in which we operate is highly competitive and has experienced recent consolidation which may continue, and we may lack the financial and other resources, expertise, scale or capability necessary to capture increased market share or maintain our market share.\nWe compete in a rapidly evolving, highly competitive market which has been, and is likely to continue to be, characterized by overcapacity, industry consolidation and continued pricing pressure. In addition, our competitors may acquire software-application vendors, technology providers or other service providers, enabling them to more effectively compete with us. We believe that participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve a significant presence to compete effectively, particularly as fixed costs increase for industry participants. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that would impede our ability to compete successfully in the IT infrastructure market. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and market resources, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry and may be able to:\n\u25cf develop and expand their IT infrastructure and service offerings more rapidly;\n\u25cf adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly;\n\u25cf take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily;\n\u25cf borrow at more competitive rates or otherwise take advantage of capital resources not available to us; or\n\u25cf devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can.\nIn addition, IT infrastructure providers may make technological advancements to enhance the quality of their services, which could negatively impact the demand for our IT infrastructure services. We also expect that we will face additional competition as we expand our product offerings, including competition from technology and telecommunications companies and non-technology companies which are entering the market through leveraging their existing or expanded network services and cloud infrastructure. Further, the ability of some of these potential competitors to bundle other services and products with their network services could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Various companies also are exploring the possibility of providing, or are currently providing, high-speed, intelligent data services that use connections to more than one network or use alternative delivery methods, including the cable television infrastructure, direct broadcast satellites and wireless local loops.\nWe may lack financial and other resources, expertise or capability necessary to maintain or capture increased market share. Increased competition and technological advancements by our competitors could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a long sales cycle for our IT infrastructure services and the implementation efforts required by customers to activate them can be substantial.\nMany of our IT infrastructure services are complex and require substantial sales efforts and technical consultation to implement. A customer\u2019s decision to outsource some or all of its IT infrastructure typically involves a significant commitment of resources. Some customers may be reluctant to purchase our services due to their inability to accurately forecast future demand, delay in decision-making or inability to obtain necessary internal approvals to commit resources. We may expend time and resources pursuing a particular sale or customer that does not result in revenue. Delays due to the length of our sales cycle may harm our ability to meet our forecasts and materially and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\n- 8 -\nWe may lose customers if they elect to develop or maintain some or all of their IT infrastructure services internally.\nOur current and potential customers may decide to develop or maintain their own IT infrastructure rather than outsource to service providers like us. These in-house IT infrastructure services could be perceived to be superior or more cost effective compared to our services. If we fail to offer IT infrastructure services that compete favorably with in-sourced services or if we fail to differentiate our IT infrastructure services, we may lose customers or fail to attract customers that may consider pursuing this in-sourced approach, and our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations would suffer as a result.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 business models may change in ways that we do not anticipate and these changes could reduce or eliminate our customers\u2019 needs for our services. If this occurs, we could lose customers or potential customers, and our business and financial results would suffer. As a result of these or similar potential developments in the future, it is possible that competitive dynamics in our market may require us to reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, gross margin and operating results.\nIf governments modify or increase regulation of the Internet, or goods or services necessary to operate the Internet or our IT infrastructure, our services could become more costly.\nInternational bodies and federal, state and local governments have adopted a number of laws and regulations that affect the Internet and are likely to continue to seek to implement additional laws and regulations. In addition, federal and state agencies have adopted or are actively considering regulation of various aspects of the Internet and/or IP services, including taxation of transactions, enhanced data privacy and retention legislation and various energy regulations, as well as law enforcement surveillance and anti-terrorism initiatives targeting instant messaging applications. For example, if the Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) were to impose federal Universal Service Fund requirements on a number of our managed hosting services such as virtual private network, dedicated IP and other enterprise customer services, that could raise our costs, and potentially require us to charge more for our services than we currently do and negatively impact our business. Additionally, we must comply with federal and state consumer protection laws. Finally, other potential laws and regulations targeted at goods or services that are cost inputs necessary to operate our managed service and colocation offerings could have a negative impact on us. These factors may impact the delivery of our services by driving up the cost of power, which is a significant cost of operating our data centers and other service points.\nIn April 2015, the FCC adopted new Open Internet rules reclassifying broadband Internet access as a regulated Title II \u201ctelecommunications service.\u201d The Title II regulation subjects ISPs to common carrier regulations, including prohibiting \u201cunjust and unreasonable practices\u201d and discriminatory practices under the Communications Act, regulation of consumer privacy and other common carrier regulations. While we are not an ISP or a broadband Internet access provider, many of our customers have Internet businesses and rely on us for Web hosting, colocation of Web servers and routers and cloud services. If certain broadband access providers were to unreasonably interfere or disadvantage certain of our Internet edge provider customers by not allowing consumers to access them under comparable rates and service terms, then that could harm our business.\nThe 2015 Open Internet Order also established \u201cbright line rules\u201d that prohibit an ISP from blocking, throttling (impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or service), and paid prioritization or \u201cfast lanes,\u201d including for ISP affiliates. The new rules also enhance the existing transparency requirements for service quality disclosures to broadband services customers and set a standard of conduct for ISPs. Several challenges to the Commission\u2019s 2015 Open Internet Order were filed before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals including the Commission\u2019s reclassification of broadband Internet access as a Title II telecommunications service. In June 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FCC\u2019s Open Internet Order in a 2-1 decision. The ruling can be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.\nIt is unclear what the long-term impact will be of the new Open Internet regulations. Commercial arrangements for the exchange of traffic with broadband Internet providers and treatment of edge provider offerings by broadband providers now fall within the scope of Title II, however, the Commission has stated that regulatory complaints about such issues as usage-based pricing plans by consumers or \u201czero rating\u201d sponsored data plans by edge provider will be evaluated on a no-unreasonable interference/disadvantage standard on a case-by-case basis, making it very uncertain how such practices will be regulated, if at all.\nIn January 2017, a new Chairman of the FCC was appointed. It is unclear what short term and long term impacts will occur as a result of new leadership at the FCC.\nA legislative amendment proposed in 2015 to amend the Communications Act remains pending. The legislation would amend the Communications Act to expressly (a) classify broadband as an information service; (b) allow ISPs to offer \u201cspecialized services\u201d or \u201cservices other than broadband Internet access service that are offered over the same network\u201d; and (c) prohibit blocking of lawful content, throttling data and paid prioritization. The proposed legislative reforms would apply to both wireless and wireline broadband services. The amendment would override the Commission\u2019s reclassification of broadband as a telecommunications service in the 2015 Open Internet Order. If this proposed legislation or similar legislation is enacted which does not treat broadband Internet access or the service interconnecting Internet content edge providers with ISPs as a telecommunications service, it could disadvantage our edge provider customers and adversely impact our business.\n- 9 -\nIn another pending rulemaking, the FCC is proposing to regulate Internet-based video programming providers as multi-channel video programming distributors (\u201cMVPDs\u201d) as it currently regulates established cable television providers and satellite providers. The FCC has tentatively concluded that the traditional definition of MVPD requiring ownership of the video transmission path should be expanded to include Internet-based video programmers. This proceeding could directly impact the ability to compete for video programming of a number of Internap\u2019s customers, and thereby impact the future use of Internap\u2019s services.\nIn addition, laws relating to the liability of private network operators and information carried on or disseminated through their networks are unsettled, both in the U.S. and abroad. The nature of any new laws and regulations and the interpretation of applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade secret, national security, law enforcement, obscenity, libel, employment, personal privacy, consumer protection and other issues are uncertain and developing. We may become subject to legal claims such as defamation, invasion of privacy or copyright infringement in connection with content stored on or distributed through our network. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with privacy rules and regulations implemented by foreign governments and agencies, our business could be adversely affected and we could face claims for liabilities.\nIn October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated Decision 2000/520, which provided a safe harbor for businesses to transfer personal data from European Union countries to the United States if the recipient company agreed to comply with Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. Since that time, the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce have been negotiating a next generation Safe Harbor agreement to enable the transfer of personal data from E.U. countries to the U.S. and reduce the risk of enforcement actions being brought by E.U. member privacy regulators against U.S. companies for failing to adequately protect the transfer of personal data of E.U. citizens. On February 2, 2016, E.U. and U.S. officials announced the terms of a new U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor agreement, referred to as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. On July 12, 2016, the European Commission deemed the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework adequate to enable data transfers under EU law. Failure to comply or implement certain privacy safeguards could negatively impact our business and give rise to claims for liabilities.\nIf we fail to comply with telecommunications services regulations our business could be negatively affected.\nOne of our subsidiaries offers Metro Connect Ethernet data transmission services to customers colocated at our data centers to enable expanded connectivity. These are regulated telecommunications services, which require our subsidiary to obtain regulatory certifications and often to maintain an approved tariff in most states in which these services are offered. There are various regulatory compliance requirements to operate as a telecommunications carrier, such as the filing of tariffs, annual reports and universal service reports. We also must comply with state consumer protection laws in every state in which we operate. Failure to comply with any of these requirements could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for key elements of our IT infrastructure services and products. If we are unable to obtain these elements on a cost-effective basis, or at all, or if such services are interrupted, limited or terminated, our growth prospects and business operations may be adversely affected.\nIn delivering our services, we rely on a number of Internet networks, many of which are built and operated by third parties. To provide high performance connectivity services through our network access points, we purchase connections from several ISPs. We can offer no assurances that these ISPs will continue to provide service to us on a continuous, cost-effective basis or on competitive terms, if at all, or that these providers will provide us with additional capacity to adequately meet customer demand or to expand our business. Consolidation among ISPs limits the number of vendors from which we obtain service, possibly resulting in higher network costs to us. We may be unable to establish and maintain relationships with other ISPs that may emerge or that are significant in geographic areas, such as Asia and Europe, in which we may locate our future network access points. Any of these situations could limit our growth prospects and materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe also depend on other companies to supply various key elements of our network infrastructure, including the network access loops between our network access points and our ISP, local loops between our network access points and our customers\u2019 networks and certain end-user access networks. Pricing for such network access loops and local loops has risen over time and operators of these networks may take measures that could degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of our or our customers\u2019 access to certain of these end-user access networks by restricting or prohibiting the use of their networks to support or facilitate our services, or by charging increased fees. Some of our competitors have their own network access loops and local loops and are, therefore, not subject to similar availability and pricing issues.\n- 10 -\nFor data center and hosting facilities, we rely on a number of vendors to provide physical space, convert or build space to our specifications, provide power, internal cabling and wiring, climate control, physical security and system redundancy. We typically obtain physical space through long-term leases. We utilize multiple other vendors to perform leasehold improvements necessary to make the physical space available for occupancy. The demand for premium data center and hosting space in several key markets has outpaced supply over recent years and the imbalance is projected to continue over the near term. This has limited our physical space options and increased, and will continue to increase, our costs to add capacity. If we are not able to procure space through renewing our existing leases or entering into new leases, or are not able to contain costs for physical space, or are not able to pass these costs on to our customers, our results will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we currently purchase infrastructure equipment such as servers, routers, switches and storage components from a limited number of vendors. We do not carry significant inventories of the equipment we purchase, and we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our vendors. A loss of a significant vendor could delay any build-out of our infrastructure and increase our costs. If our limited source of suppliers fails to provide products or services that comply with evolving Internet standards or that interoperate with other products or services we use in our network infrastructure, we may be unable to meet all or a portion of our customer service commitments, which could materially and adversely affect our results.\nSome of our products and services contain or use open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\nWe use open source software in our products and for certain services and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nAny failure of our physical IT infrastructure could lead to unexpected costs and disruptions that could harm our business reputation, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on providing customers with highly-reliable services. We must protect our IT infrastructure and our customers\u2019 data and their equipment located in our data centers. The services we provide in each of our data centers are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf human error;\n\u25cf physical or electronic security breaches;\n\u25cf fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters;\n\u25cf improper maintenance of the buildings in which our data centers are located;\n\u25cf water damage, extreme temperatures and fiber cuts;\n\u25cf power loss or equipment failure;\n\u25cf sabotage and vandalism; and\n\u25cf failures experienced by underlying service providers upon which our business relies.\nProblems at one or more of our company-controlled facilities or our partner sites, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant equipment damage. Most of our customers have SLAs that require us to meet minimum performance obligations and to provide service credits to customers if we do not meet those obligations. If a service interruption impacts a significant portion of our customer base, the amount of service credits we are required to provide could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Also, if we experience a service interruption and we fail to provide a service credit under an SLA, we could face claims related to such failures, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Because our data centers are critical to our customers\u2019 businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers also could result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. We cannot guarantee that a court would enforce any contractual limitations on our liability in the event that a customer brings a lawsuit against us as the result of a failure to meet performance obligations in our SLAs.\nAny loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet performance obligations in our SLAs could reduce the confidence of our customers and could result in lost customers or an inability to attract new customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results.\n- 11 -\nFurthermore, we are dependent upon ISPs and telecommunications carriers in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific region, some of whom have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. Users of our services may experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and services. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur inability to renew our data center leases, or renew on favorable terms, and potential unknown costs related to asset retirement obligations could negatively impact our financial results.\nGenerally, our company-controlled data center leases provide us with the opportunity to renew the leases at our option for periods typically ranging from five to 10 years. Many of these options provide that rent for the renewal period will be the fair market rental rate at the time of renewal. If the fair market rental rates are higher than our current rental rates, we may be unable to offset these costs by charging more for our services, which could have a negative impact on our financial results. Conversely, if rental rates drop in the near term, we would not be able to take advantage of the drop in rates until the expiration of the lease as we would be bound by the terms of the existing lease.\nFor the leases that do not contain renewal options, or for which the option to renew has been exhausted or passed, we cannot guarantee the lessor will renew the lease, or will do so at a rate that will allow us to maintain profitability on that particular space. While we proactively monitor these leases and conduct ongoing negotiations with lessors, our ability to renegotiate renewals is inherently limited by the original contract language, including option renewal clauses. If we are unable to renew, we may incur substantial costs to move our infrastructure and/or customers and to restore the property to its required condition. There is no guarantee that our customers would move with us and we may not be able to find appropriate and sufficient space. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have capital lease agreements that require us to decommission the physical space for which we have not yet recorded an asset retirement obligation (\u201cARO\u201d). Due to the uncertainty of specific decommissioning obligations, timing and related costs, an ARO is not reasonably estimable for these properties and we have not recorded a liability at this time for such properties.\nA failure in the redundancies in one or more of our NOCs, P-NAPs or computer systems could cause a significant disruption in Internet connectivity which could impact our ability to serve our customers.\nWhile we maintain multiple layers of redundancy in our operating facilities, if we experience a problem at one or more of our NOCs, including the failure of redundant systems, we may be unable to provide Internet connectivity services to our customers, provide customer service and support or monitor our network infrastructure or P-NAPs, any of which would seriously harm our reputation, business and operating results. Also, because we are obligated to provide continuous Internet availability under our SLAs, we may be required to issue service credits as a result of such interruptions in service. If material, these credits could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, interruptions in service to our customers could potentially harm our customer relations, expose us to potential lawsuits or necessitate additional capital expenditures.\nA significant number of our P-NAPs are located in facilities owned and operated by third parties. In many of those arrangements, we do not have property rights similar to those customarily possessed by a lessee or subtenant but instead have lesser rights of occupancy. In certain situations, the financial condition of those parties providing occupancy to us could have an adverse impact on the continued occupancy arrangement or the level of service delivered to us under such arrangements.\nOur network and software are subject to potential security breaches and similar threats that could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nA number of widespread and disabling attacks on public and private networks have occurred in the past in our industry. The number and severity of these attacks may increase in the future as network assailants take advantage of outdated software, software vulnerabilities, security breaches or incompatibility between or among networks. Computer viruses, intrusions and similar disruptive problems could cause us to be liable for damages under agreements with our customers and fines and penalties to governmental or regulatory agencies, and our reputation could suffer, thereby resulting in a loss of current customers and deterring potential customers from working with us. Security problems or other attacks caused by third parties could lead to interruptions and delays or to the cessation of service to our customers. Furthermore, inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems and in those of our customers and could expose us to liability under unsolicited commercial e-mail, or \u201cspam,\u201d regulations. In the past, third parties have occasionally circumvented some of these industry-standard measures. We can offer no assurance that the measures we implement will not be circumvented. Our efforts to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems, or any circumvention of those efforts, may result in increased costs, interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our customers and negatively impact hosted customers\u2019 on-line business transactions. Affected customers might file claims against us under such circumstances, and our insurance may not be available or adequate to cover these claims.\n- 12 -\nOur business requires the continued development of effective and efficient business support systems to support our customer growth and related services.\nThe growth of our business depends on our ability to continue to develop and successfully implement effective and efficient business support policies, processes and internal systems. This is a complicated undertaking requiring significant resources and expertise. Business support systems are needed for:\n\u25cf sourcing, evaluating and targeting potential customers and managing existing customers;\n\u25cf implementing customer orders for services;\n\u25cf delivering these services;\n\u25cf timely billing and collection for these services;\n\u25cf budgeting, forecasting, tracking and reporting our results of operations; and\n\u25cf providing technical and operational support to customers and tracking the resolution of customer issues.\nIf the number of customers that we serve or our services portfolio increases, we may need to develop additional business support systems on a schedule sufficient to meet proposed service rollout dates. The failure to continue to develop effective and efficient business support systems, and update or optimize these systems to a level commensurate with the needs of our business and/or our competition, could harm our ability to implement our business plans, maintain competitiveness and meet our financial goals and objectives.\nOur global operations may not be successful.\nWe operate globally in various locations. We may develop or acquire P-NAPs or complementary businesses in additional global markets. The risks associated with our global business operations include:\n\u25cf challenges in establishing and maintaining relationships with global customers, ISPs and local vendors, including data center and local network operators;\n\u25cf challenges in staffing and managing NOCs and P-NAPs across disparate geographic areas;\n\u25cf potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than the laws in the U.S.;\n\u25cf challenges in reducing operating expense or other costs required by local laws and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf exposure to fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf costs of customizing P-NAPs for foreign countries and customers; and\n\u25cf compliance with requirements of foreign laws, regulations and other governmental controls, including trade and labor restrictions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related laws that may reduce the flexibility of our business operations or favor local competition.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to address the risks associated with our global operations, which may limit our sales growth and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain our key executives and employees and hire and retain qualified sales, research and development, technical, marketing and support personnel, our ability to compete could be materially adversely affected.\nOur current and future success depends upon the services of our executive officers and other key technology, sales, research and development, marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience, knowledge and relationships. There is significant competition for such talented individuals, which affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones.\nWe have recently experienced turnover at the executive ranks of our Company. Members of our senior management team have left our Company over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot be certain that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations and detrimental to our future outlook. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or our inability to attract and retain new talent could hinder or delay the implementation of our business strategy and negatively impact our ability to sell our services.\n- 13 -\nAcquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions we complete could result in operating difficulties, dilution, diversion of management attention and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into acquisitions, joint ventures and other types of strategic relationships that involve close cooperation with other companies. Acquisitions and other complex transactions are accompanied by a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u25cf potential disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u25cf potential distraction of management;\n\u25cf diversion of business resources from core operations;\n\u25cf expenses and potential liabilities related to the transactions or acquired business;\n\u25cf failure to realize synergies or other expected benefits; and\n\u25cf increased accounting charges such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, amortization of intangible assets acquired and a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired.\nAny inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. As we complete acquisitions, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our offerings while maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our business operations, brand and reputation. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result. Future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in dilutive issuances of securities. Technology sharing or other strategic relationships we enter into may give rise to disputes over intellectual property ownership, operational responsibilities and other significant matters. Such disputes may be expensive and time-consuming to resolve and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in various types of litigation that may adversely impact our business.\nFrom time to time, we are or may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses even if the claims are without merit. Furthermore, because such matters are inherently unpredictable, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these matters will not have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nGeneral global market, political and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business has been and could continue to be affected by general global economic, political and market conditions. To the extent economic conditions impair our customers' ability to profitably monetize the content we deliver on their behalf, they may reduce or eliminate the traffic we deliver for them. Such reductions in traffic would lead to a reduction in our revenue. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure, customer loss, a slow down in commerce over the Internet and corresponding decrease in traffic delivered over our network and failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all. Suppliers on which we rely on for various services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on our operations or expenses. In addition, political effects such as changes to (i) trade and tariff laws, (ii) tax laws, (iii) the makeup or function of regulatory bodies and (iv) employee laws could have a significant negative impact on our business. There can be no assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results or that current or future political conditions will not negatively impact our business.\nGlobal or local climate change and natural resource conservation regulations could adversely impact our business.\nOur operations, including our data centers and server networks, require and consume significant energy resources, including electricity generated by the burning of fossil fuels. In response to concerns about global climate change, governments may adopt new regulations affecting the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel sources to power energy resources that serve our operations. In addition, our customers and investors may require us to take steps to demonstrate that we are taking ecologically responsible measures in operating our business. The costs and any expenses we incur to make our network more energy efficient could make us less profitable in future periods. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could lead to fines, lost revenue and damage to our reputation.\n- 14 -\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock and Other Business Risks\nWe have a history of losses and may not sustain profitability.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred net losses of $124.7 million, $48.4 million and $39.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $1.3 billion and our working capital deficit was $15.9 million. Given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds or refinance our current levels of indebtedness.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to fluctuate, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. Fluctuation in our operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We expect to experience continued fluctuations in our operating results in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf competition and the introduction of new services by our competitors;\n\u25cf continued pricing pressures;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the demand and sales cycle for our services;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the market for qualified sales, customer support and retention and other personnel;\n\u25cf the cost and availability of adequate public utilities, including power;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain local loop connections to our P-NAPs at favorable prices; and\n\u25cf any impairment or restructuring charges that we may incur in the future.\nIn addition, fluctuations in our results of operations may arise from strategic decisions we have made or may make with respect to the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures such as those associated with the expansion of our data center facilities, the deployment of additional P-NAPs, the terms of our network connectivity purchase agreements and the cost of servers, storage and other equipment necessary to deploy hosting and cloud services. A relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to lease and personnel expense, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. Our results of operations, therefore, are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenue. We can offer no assurance that the results of any particular period are an indication of future performance in our business operations. Fluctuations in our results of operations could have a negative impact on our ability to raise additional capital and execute our business plan.\nWe may incur additional goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring charges or both.\nThe assumptions, inputs and judgments used in performing the valuation analysis and assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets are inherently subjective and reflect estimates based on known facts and circumstances at the time the valuation is performed. The use of different assumptions, inputs and judgments or changes in circumstances could materially affect the results of the valuation and assessments. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from our estimates.\nWhen circumstances warrant, we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations. When we make such a change, we will estimate the costs to exit a business or restructure ongoing operations. The components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent our best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation. Should circumstances warrant, we will adjust our previous estimates to reflect what we then believe to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs. Because our estimates and assumptions regarding impairment and restructuring charges include probabilities of future events, such as expected operating results, future economic conditions, the ability to find a sublease tenant within a reasonable period of time or the rate at which a sublease tenant will pay for the available space, such estimates are inherently subject to changes due to unforeseen circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Adverse changes in any of these factors could result in additional impairment and restructuring charges in the future.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market for our equity securities has been extremely volatile. Our stock price could suffer in the future as a result of any failure to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors about our results of operations from quarter to quarter. The following factors could cause the price of our common stock in the public market to fluctuate significantly:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual results of operations;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of companies in the industries in which we may compete;\n\u25cf changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;\n- 15 -\n\u25cf fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u25cf future issuances of common stock or other securities;\n\u25cf the addition or departure of key personnel; and\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances.\nOur ability to use U.S. net operating loss carryforwards might be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $289.6 million for U.S. federal tax purposes. These loss carryforwards expire between 2018 and 2036. To the extent these net operating loss carryforwards are available; we intend to use them to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. To the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits.\nWe may face litigation and liability due to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights and due to our customers\u2019 use of our IT infrastructure services.\nThe IT infrastructure services industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. From time-to-time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. Any claims that our IT infrastructure services infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, our customer agreements generally require us to indemnify our customers for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringement of patents or copyrights of third parties, subject to certain limitations. If an infringement claim against us were to be successful, and we were not able to obtain a license to the relevant technology or a substitute technology on acceptable terms or redesign our services or products to avoid infringement, our ability to compete successfully in our market would be materially impaired.\nIn addition, our customers use our IT infrastructure services to operate and run certain aspects and functions of their businesses. From time-to-time, third parties may assert that our customers\u2019 businesses, including the business aspects and functions for which they use our IT infrastructure services, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or legal rights. Our customers\u2019 businesses may also be subject to regulatory oversight, governmental investigation, data breaches and lawsuits by their customers, competitors or other third parties based on a broad range of legal theories. Such third parties may seek to hold us liable on the basis of contributory or vicarious liability or other legal theories. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could negatively impact our operating results. If any such claim against us were to be successful, damages could be material and our ability to compete successfully in our market would be materially impaired.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and provisions of Delaware law, could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company. These provisions are intended to protect stockholders\u2019 interests by providing our board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a board of directors that is classified so that only one-third of directors stand for election each year. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions.\nActions of stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have been, and may be in the future, subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. If stockholder activities develop, our business could be adversely affected as responding to proxy contests or stockholder proposals and reacting to other actions by stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. We may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on certain stockholder matters, including legal, financial and communications advisors, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\n- 16 -\nConcentration of ownership among our certain large stockholders and their affiliates may limit the influence of new investors on corporate decisions and the interests of such large stockholders may materially differ from your interests.\nA majority of our outstanding shares are held by a relatively small number of our stockholders. As a result, if some of these stockholders vote in an aligned manner, they could be capable of meaningfully influencing the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may delay or preclude an acquisition or cause the market price of our stock to decline. Some of these persons or entities may have interests that may materially differ from the rest of our stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock may decline if our stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or if we issue a large number of new shares of our common stock.\nA majority of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by a relatively small number of our stockholders. A sale of a substantial number of our shares in the public market by our significant stockholders or pursuant to new issuances by us could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We recently completed a private placement of common stock pursuant to which we agreed to file and maintain a registration statement for the resale of such stockholders\u2019 shares and to provide various assistance in connection with offerings or other sales of such shares. The applicable registration statement imposes financial penalties on us if we fail to have an effective registration statement for the shares by a specific deadline or upon the occurrence of certain other events. If the registration statement is not declared effective by the SEC on or prior to that date, the Company will make pro rata payments to the Purchasers in an amount equal to 1.5% of the aggregate purchase price initially paid for such registrable securities, for each 30-day period or pro rata for any portion thereof following May 23, 2017 for which the registration statement has not been declared effective. Any such sale or issuance of common stock could have material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, new issuances of common stock by us would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements as set forth in The NASDAQ Listing Rules, our common stock could be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market, and if this were to occur, then the price and liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital could be adversely affected.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Market. Continued listing of a security on The NASDAQ Global Market is conditioned upon compliance with certain continued listing requirements set forth in the NASDAQ Listing Rules. There can be no assurance we will continue to satisfy the requirements for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market.\nIn the last year, our common stock has closed, at times, below $1.00 per share. If we are not able to maintain compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in the NASDAQ Listing Rules for NASDAQ Global Market companies, our common stock will likely be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market and an associated decrease in liquidity in the market for our common stock may occur. If, for 30 consecutive business days, we fail to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for our common stock, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC will notify us of the compliance failure. In accordance with applicable listing rules, NASDAQ will grant a compliance period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule. We intend to cure any minimum bid price compliance deficiency by taking actions to increase the trading price of our common stock, including such actions as effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. The delisting of our common stock could materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets, and any limitation on liquidity or reduction in the price of our common stock could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. Delisting from The NASDAQ Global Market could also result in the potential loss of confidence by our business partners and suppliers, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. In addition, the terms of our debt instruments impose limitations on our ability to pay dividends. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\n- 17 -\nRisks Related to our Substantial Indebtedness\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our credit agreement or other debt agreements, there would be a default under the terms of these agreements, and this could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that have been borrowed or may have other material adverse effects on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur existing credit agreement requires us to, among other things, meet certain financial covenants related to (i) our maximum total leverage ratio, (ii) our minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, (iii) limitations on our capital expenditures and (iv) other negative and reporting covenants. These covenants protect the lenders and limit our ability to make certain operating and business decisions in the face of changing market dynamics. These covenants can be waived by the lenders. However, the cost of obtaining waivers, which could be material, must be weighed against the opportunity created by adjusting the covenants. In addition, our credit facility create liens on a majority our assets.\nIf we do not satisfy these covenants, we would be in default under the credit agreement. Any defaults, if not waived or cured, could result in our lenders ceasing to make loans or extending credit to us, accelerating or declaring all or any obligations immediately due or taking possession of or liquidating collateral. Defaults on our credit agreement could cause cross-defaults under other agreements or have negative impacts on other commercial arrangements with vendors that provide services to us. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the credit agreement on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or obtain a waiver or forbearance of the covenants, which could materially and adversely impact our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, our ability to access sources of liquidity or the capital markets may be limited at a time when we would like or need to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to pursue expansion opportunities and maintain our desired level of revenue growth in the future.\nDuring 2016, we entered into the second amendment to our credit facility (the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d) to, among other things, amend the interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants to make them less restrictive and increase the applicable margin for the revolving credit facility and term loan by 1.0%. Absent the Second Amendment, we would have been unable to comply with our covenants in the credit facility. In January 2017, we entered into the third amendment to our credit facility (the \u201cThird Amendment\u201d), which became effective in February 2017. The Third Amendment, among other things, amended the credit agreement to make each of the interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants less restrictive and to decrease the maximum level of permitted capital expenditures. Absent the Third Amendment we may not have been able to comply with our covenants in the credit agreement. We can make no assurances that we will be able to comply with our covenants in the future or whether we will be able to obtain future amendments or waivers of the covenants in our financing agreements and instruments, if necessary, upon acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, future amendments or waivers may place future restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, as well as increase the cost of our financing.\nWe currently have a significant amount of debt which we may not be able to repay when due. Any failure to meet or repay our debt or meet our debt obligations and other long-term commitments would have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total debt, including capital leases, was $380.4 million. Our second secured first lien revolving credit facility (\u201crevolving credit facility\u201d) matures on November 26, 2018 and our senior secured first lien term loan facility (\u201cterm loan\u201d) matures on November 26, 2019. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof or incur additional debt. Our significant level of debt could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional debt financing in the future. In addition, if we raise additional funds by incurring additional debt, we will incur increased debt service costs or be subject to increased interest rates and may become subject to more restrictive financial and other covenants which could limit our ability to operate our business as we desire. We can make no assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIf our financial performance weakens or if we are unable to make interest or principal payments when due, meet our covenants or amend our credit facility to modify the covenants, we may default under our credit facility. Such default would result in all principal and interest becoming due and payable, if not waived. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If a waiver is required we may not be able to obtain the waiver or it could come at a material cost to us.\nWe also have other long-term commitments for operating leases and service and purchase contracts. If we are unable to make payments when due, we would be in breach of contractual terms of the agreements, which may result in disruptions of our services which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n- 18 -\nOur significant amount of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to compete in our industry.\nOur significant amount of indebtedness could materially adversely affect us. For example, it could: require us to (i) dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations and investing activities to make payments on our debt, which would reduce our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, (ii) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions (such as credit-related disruptions), (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates or on better terms; and (iv) limit our ability to react to competitive pressures, or make it difficult for us to carry out capital spending that is necessary or important to our strategy. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to compete in our industry.\nTo service our significant indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. However, our ability to generate cash depends on many factors many of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we use more cash than we generate in the future or fail to generate cash, our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions and by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. We can make no assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In these circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Without this financing, we could be forced to sell assets or secure additional financing to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances. However, we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all.\nDisruptions in the financial markets or increases in interest rates could affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness on reasonable terms (or at all), could increase the cost of servicing our debt and have other adverse effects on us.\nDisruptions in the commercial credit markets could result in a tightening of credit markets or an increase in interest rates or borrowing rates. The effects of credit market disruptions in the past were widespread, and it is impossible to predict future credit markets or interest rates. As a result, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all which could affect our strategic operations and our financial performance and force modifications to our operations. In addition, if interest rates increase between the time an existing financing arrangement is consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a result of the material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016. The assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. We are actively engaged in remediating the material weakness, but our remediation efforts are not complete and are ongoing. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, it may materially adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner and impact investor confidence in our Company. Although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The next time we evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, if we identify one or more new material weaknesses or are unable to timely remediate our existing weakness, we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and possibly impact our ability to obtain future financing on acceptable terms, if at all.", "PERMNO": 87236, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "INAPQ"}
