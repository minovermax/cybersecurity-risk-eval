RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report, the following risks may affect us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer. As a result, the price of our common shares could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Merger with First Financial.\nCombining with First Financial may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger with First Financial may not be realized.\nThe Company and First Financial have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on First Financial\u2019s and the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of the Company and First Financial in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, depositors, clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. If the combined companies experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. There also may be business disruptions that cause the Company and/or First Financial to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Company and/or First Financial and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of the Company and First Financial during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Merger on the combined company.\nAdditionally, the combined company may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings, revenue enhancements and other synergies that it expects, and may not be able to capitalize upon the existing customer relationships of each party to the extent anticipated, or it may take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected, to achieve these goals. These circumstances could have an adverse effect on the combined company's business, results of operation and stock price.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger with First Financial is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger with First Financial on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships. Retention of certain employees by us may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us, our business could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, we have agreed to operate our business in the ordinary course prior to closing.\nThe Merger may distract our management from their other responsibilities.\nThe Merger could cause our management to focus their time and energies on matters related to the Merger that otherwise would be directed to our business and operations. Any such distraction on the part of our management, if significant, could affect our ability to service existing business and develop new business and adversely affect our business and earnings before the Merger, or the business and earnings of the combined company after the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit each party\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, could discourage a potential competing acquirer of either the Company or First Financial from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require MainSource to pay First Financial a termination fee of $40.0 million.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, each of the Company and First Financial has agreed not to, subject to certain exceptions generally related to its board of directors or the exercise of its fiduciary duties (as set forth in the Merger Agreement), solicit or initiate, or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage, inquiries or proposals with respect to, engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information relating to, any alternative business combination transactions. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for each of the Company and First Financial. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including certain breaches of the Merger Agreement, the Company or First Financial, as applicable, is required to reimburse the other party for its transaction-related expenses.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.\nIf the Merger with First Financial is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement with First Financial. If the Merger is not completed, we would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.\nRisks Related to Our Business.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of loans, which if not repaid could result in losses to the Company.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing the payment of their loans (if any) may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total loan portfolio was approximately $3,063 million or 66% of our total assets. Three major components of the loan portfolio are loans principally secured by real estate, approximately $2,417 million or 79% of total loans; other commercial loans, approximately $579 million or 19% of total loans; and consumer loans, approximately $67 million or 2% of total loans. Our credit risk with respect to our consumer installment loan portfolio and commercial loan portfolio relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses within our local market area. Our credit risk with respect to our residential and commercial real estate mortgage and construction loan portfolio relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses and the value of real estate serving as security for the repayment of the loans. A related risk in connection with loans secured by commercial real estate is the effect of unknown or unexpected environmental contamination, which could make the real estate effectively unmarketable or otherwise significantly reduce its value as security. Continued or worsening declines in the economy could cause additional credit issues, particularly within our residential and commercial real estate mortgage and construction loan portfolio.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level estimated by management to be sufficient to cover probable incurred loan losses in our loan portfolio. Loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have experienced to date. In determining the size of the allowance, our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the diversification by industry of our commercial loan portfolio, the effect of changes in the local real estate markets on collateral values, the results of recent regulatory examinations, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers, the amount of charge-offs for the period, the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security, and the evaluation of our loan portfolio by an external loan review. If our assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Additionally, continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside the Company\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Federal and state regulators also periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses.\nIf we foreclose on collateral property, we may be subject to the increased costs associated with ownership of real property, resulting in reduced revenues and earnings.\nWe may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: (i) general or local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; (vi) environmental remediation liabilities; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and (x) acts of God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property, and we may have to advance funds in order to protect our investment, or we may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, resulting in reduced levels of profitability.\nFluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur profitability is dependent to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margin, and, in turn, our profitability. We manage our interest rate risk within established guidelines and generally seek an asset and liability structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates. However, our interest rate risk management practices may not be effective in a highly volatile rate environment.\nRevisions to the mortgage regulations may adversely impact our business.\nRevisions made pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (the \u201cTILA\u201d), were effective in January 2014, and apply to all consumer mortgages (except home equity lines of credit, timeshare plans, reverse mortgages, or temporary loans). The revisions mandate specific underwriting criteria and \u201cability to repay\u201d requirements for home loans. This may impact our offering and underwriting of single family residential loans in our residential mortgage lending operation and could have a resulting unknown effect on potential delinquencies. In\naddition, the relatively uniform requirements may make it difficult for regional and community banks to compete against the larger national banks for single family residential loan originations.\nThe impact of new capital rules will impose enhanced capital adequacy requirements on us and may materially impact our operations.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the \u201cBasel III\u201d standards, the federal banking agencies have adopted a new set of rules on minimum leverage and risk-based capital that will apply to both insured banks and their holding companies. These regulations were issued in July 2013. The full implementation of the new capital rules may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to pay significantly higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) premiums in the future.\nInsured institution failures during the past several years have significantly increased FDIC loss provisions, resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio to historical lows. In addition the Dodd-Frank Act permanently implemented FDIC insurance coverage for all deposit accounts up to $250,000 and revised the insurance premium assessment base from all domestic deposits to the average of total assets less tangible equity. The minimum reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund has been increased from 1.15% to 1.35%, with the increase to be covered by assessments on insured institutions with assets over $10 billion until the new reserve ratio is reached.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Additionally, the FDIC may make material changes to the calculation of the prepaid assessment from the current proposal. Any future changes in the calculation or assessment of FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at the current rate or at all.\nFuture growth or operating results may require the Company to raise additional capital but that capital may not be available or it may be dilutive.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. To the extent our future operating results erode capital or we elect to expand through loan growth or acquisition we may be required to raise capital. Our ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital if needed or on favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand our operations through acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent upon the services of our management team. The loss of any of our senior managers could have an adverse effect on our growth and performance because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which we operate and years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. The loss of key personnel in a particular market could have an adverse effect on our performance in that market because it may be difficult to find qualified replacement personnel who are already located in or would be willing to relocate to a non-metropolitan market. Additionally, recent regulations issued by banking regulators regarding executive compensation may impact our ability to compensate executives and, as a result, to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nThe geographic concentration of our markets makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions.\nUnlike larger banking organizations that are more geographically diversified, our operations are currently concentrated in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, and Kentucky. As a result of this geographic concentration in four fairly contiguous markets, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. A deterioration in economic conditions in one or all of these markets could result in one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\nan increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u00b7\nan increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u00b7\na decrease in the demand for our products and services; or\n\u00b7\na decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nIf we do not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry, our financial performance may suffer.\nWe face substantial competition for deposit, credit and trust relationships, as well as other sources of funding in the communities we serve. Competing providers include other banks, thrifts and trust companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking operations, credit unions, finance companies, money market funds, financial technology companies and other financial and nonfinancial companies which may offer products functionally equivalent to those offered by the Bank. Competing providers may have greater financial resources than we do and offer services within and outside the market areas we serve. In addition to this challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, our competitors now include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services to their customers that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. If we are unable to adjust both to increased competition for traditional banking services and changing customer needs and preferences, it could adversely affect our financial performance and your investment in our common stock.\nThe operations of our business, including our interaction with customers, are increasingly done via electronic means, and this has increased our risks related to cybersecurity and data security.\nThe Company relies heavily on internal and outsourced digital technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct its business. As the Company's reliance on technology systems increases, the potential risks of technology-related operation interruptions in the Company's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems or the occurrence of cyber and data security incidents also increases. Cyber and data security incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events including, among other things, (i) gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing potentially debilitating operational disruptions; (ii) causing denial-of-service attacks on websites; or (iii) intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information. The occurrence of an operational interruption, cyber incident, data security breach or other deficiency in the security of the Company's technology systems (internal or outsourced) could negatively impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has policies and procedures expressly designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption, or security breach of its systems and maintains cyber security insurance. Significant interruptions to the Company's business from technology issues could result in expensive remediation efforts and distraction of management. The Company invests in security and controls to prevent and mitigate incidents. Although the Company has not experienced any material losses related to a technology-related operational interruption, cyber-attack, or data security breach, there can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur in the future or, if they do occur, that the impact will not be substantial.\nThe occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of the Company's technology systems could damage the Company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of proprietary information, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as its reputation or stock price. As cyber and data security threats continue to evolve, the Company expects it will be required to spend significant resources on an ongoing basis to continue to modify and enhance its protective measures and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nNegative perception of the Company through social media may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation is critical to the success of its business. The Company believes that its brand image has been well received by customers, reflecting the fact that the brand image, like the Company\u2019s business, is based in part on trust and confidence. The Company\u2019s reputation and brand image could be negatively affected by rapid and widespread distribution of publicity through social media channels. The Company\u2019s reputation could also be affected by the Company\u2019s association with clients affected negatively through social media distribution, or other third parties, or by circumstances outside of the Company\u2019s control. Negative publicity, whether true or untrue, could affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract or retain customers, or cause the Company to incur additional liabilities or costs, or result in additional regulatory scrutiny.\nAcquisitions entail risks which could negatively affect our operations.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\nexposure to asset quality problems of the acquired institution;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining adequate regulatory capital;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nrisks and expenses of entering new geographic markets;\n\u00b7\npotential significant loss of depositors or loan customers from the acquired institution; or\n\u00b7\nexposure to undisclosed or unknown liabilities of an acquired institution.\nAny of these acquisition risks could result in unexpected losses or expenses and thereby reduce the expected benefits of the acquisition.\nUnanticipated costs related to our acquisitions could reduce our future earnings per share.\nWe believe we have reasonably estimated the likely costs of integrating the operations of the banks we acquire into the Company and the incremental costs of operating such banks as a part of the MainSource family. However, it is possible that unexpected transaction costs such as taxes, fees or professional expenses or unexpected future operating expenses, such as increased personnel costs or increased taxes, as well as other types of unanticipated adverse developments, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of MainSource. If unexpected costs are incurred, acquisitions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share. Current accounting guidance requires expensing of acquisition costs. In prior years, these costs could be capitalized. In other words, if we incur such unexpected costs and expenses as a result of our acquisitions, we believe that the earnings per share of our common stock could be less than they would have been if those acquisitions had not been completed.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of the banks we have acquired and may acquire in the future and retain employees of such banks.\nOur acquisition strategy involves the integration of the banks we have acquired and may acquire in the future into MainSource Bank. The difficulties of integrating the operations of such banks with MainSource Bank include:\n\u00b7\ncoordinating geographically separated organizations;\n\u00b7\nintegrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds;\n\u00b7\ncombining different corporate cultures; or\n\u00b7\nretaining key employees.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the Company, our subsidiary banks and the banks we have acquired and may acquire in the future and the loss of key personnel. The integration of such banks as MainSource subsidiary banks requires the experience and expertise of certain key employees of such banks who we expect to retain. We cannot be sure, however, that we will be successful in retaining these employees for the time period necessary to successfully integrate such banks\u2019 operations as subsidiary banks of MainSource. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the mergers, along with the integration of the banks as MainSource subsidiary banks, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on our ability to respond to the threats and opportunities of financial technology innovation.\nFinancial technology (\u201cFinTech\u201d), a broad category referring to technological innovation in the design and delivery of financial services and products, has the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business. Investment in new technology to stay competitive may result in significant costs and increased risks of cyber security attacks. Our success depends on our ability to adapt to the pace of the rapidly changing technological environment, which is crucial to retention and acquisition of customers. On December 2, 2016 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that it will consider applications from FinTech companies to become special purpose national banks. The federal charter would largely allow FinTech companies to operate nationwide under a single set of national standards, without needing to seek state-by-state licenses or joining with brick-and-mortar banks, and may therefore allow FinTech companies to more easily compete with us for customers of financial products and services in the communities we serve.\nRisks Relating to the Banking Industry\nChanges in governmental regulation and legislation could limit our future performance and growth.\nWe are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that governs almost all aspects of our operations, as well as any acquisitions we may propose to make. Any change in applicable federal or state laws or regulations could have a substantial impact on us, our subsidiary banks and our operations. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could reduce the value of your investment.\nThe implementation of final rules under the many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could adversely affect us.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes from the enactment and ongoing implementation of Dodd-Frank. Certain provisions of Dodd-Frank are effective and have been fully implemented, including the revisions in the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and the permanent increase in FDIC coverage to $250,000; the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; the removal of remaining barriers to interstate branching and required disclosure and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Other actions to implement the final Dodd-Frank Act provisions include (i) final capital rules; (ii) a final rule to implement the\n\u201cVolcker Rule\u201d restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities; and (iii) the promulgation of final rules and increased enforcement action by the CFPB. The full implementation of certain final rules is delayed or phased in over several years; therefore, as yet we cannot definitively assess what may be the short or longer term specific or aggregate effect of the full implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act on us.\nChanges in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which we may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, investigations and limitations related to our securities, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. In light of the recent conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy, Congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in economic or political conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, as the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to repay loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans, decline.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic or political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, inflation, money supply and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, our earnings. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. In addition, substantially all of the Company\u2019s loans are to individuals and businesses in our market area. Consequently, any economic decline in the Company\u2019s primary market areas, which include Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Kentucky, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nWeakness in the U.S. economy, including within the Company\u2019s geographic footprint, has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.\nIf the strength of the U.S. economy in general or the strength of the local economies in the Company\u2019s markets declines, this could result in, among other things, a decreased demand for our products and services, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit. These factors could result in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs and increased losses in future periods, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect our financial results.\nTechnology and other changes now allow many customers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect our operations, and we may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes that are accepted by new and existing customers.\nOur earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failure.\nFinancial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk and compliance risk. A fraud can be perpetrated by a customer of MainSource, an employee, a vendor, or members of the general public. We are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans, ACH transactions, ATM transactions and checking transactions. Our largest fraud risk, associated with the origination of loans, includes the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties. Compliance risk is the risk to earnings or capital from noncompliance with laws, rules, and regulations. We face risk of noncompliance and enforcement actions under the BSA and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. The BSA requires banks and other financial institutions to, among other things, develop and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. If our policies, procedures and internal controls are deemed deficient, we could face money penalties as well as serious reputational consequences. There can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance standards by our employees or the other parties with whom we conduct business. Repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures would adversely impact our reputation, the performance of our loan portfolio, and our earnings.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Stock\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nThe Company has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common stockholders. The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and receives substantially all of its revenue and cash flow from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. Indiana state law and agreements between the Bank and its federal and state regulators may limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. In the event that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company for an extended period of time, the Company may not be able to service its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock. Additionally, any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on the Bank\u2019s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. Starting in the second quarter of 2009 and continuing to the second quarter of 2012, the Company reduced the amount of cash dividends paid. This reduction was made to preserve capital levels at the Company. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the Company has steadily raised the dividend, including an increase to $0.11 per common share in the third quarter of 2014, $0.13 per common share in the first quarter of 2015, $0.14 per common share in the third quarter of 2015, $0.15 per common share in the first quarter of 2016, $0.16 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2016, $0.17 per common share in the second quarter of 2017, and $0.18 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to raise the amount of the dividend or that it will not decrease or eliminate the dividend in the future.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors.\nGeneral market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, the following factors may cause the market price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate:\n\u00b7\nannouncements of developments related to the Company\u2019s business;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the Company\u2019s results of operations;\n\u00b7\nsales or purchases of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s securities in the marketplace;\n\u00b7\ngeneral conditions in the banking industry, the US economy or the global economy;\n\u00b7\na shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections; and\n\u00b7\nthe Company\u2019s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects.\nThe Company\u2019s charter documents and federal regulations may inhibit a takeover, or prevent a transaction that may favor or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s growth opportunities, which could cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s charter documents and federal regulations could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. In addition, the Company must obtain approval from regulatory authorities before acquiring control of any other company.", "PERMNO": 77256, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MSFG"}
