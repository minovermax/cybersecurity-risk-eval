In addition to the other information in this report, you should consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nMaterial changes in the life insurance secondary market, a relatively new and evolving market, may adversely affect our operating results, business prospects and our ability to repay our debt obligations.\nOur primary business, the purchase and ownership of life insurance policies acquired in the secondary market, is a relatively new and evolving market. The success of our business and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations depends in large part on the continued development of the secondary market for life insurance, including the accuracy of actuarial forecasting and the solvency of life insurance companies to pay the face value of the life insurance benefits, both of which will critically impact our performance. We expect that the development of the secondary market will be impacted by a variety of factors such as the interpretation of existing laws and regulations (including laws relating to insurable interests), the passage of new legislation and regulations, mortality improvement rates, updated actuarial methodologies, and mortality tables. Importantly, all of the factors that we believe will most significantly affect the development of the life insurance secondary market are beyond our control. Any material and adverse development in the life insurance secondary market could adversely affect our operating results, our access to capital, our ability to repay our various debt and other obligations, and our business prospects and viability. Because of this, an investment in our securities involves greater risk as compared to investments offered by companies with more diversified business operations in more established markets.\nThe valuation of our principal assets on our balance sheet requires us to make material assumptions that may ultimately prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove incorrect, we could suffer significant losses that materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur principal asset is a portfolio of life insurance policies purchased in the secondary and tertiary markets, comprising approximately 79% of our total assets as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016. Those assets are considered \u201cLevel 3\u201d fair value measurements under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d), as there is currently no active market where we are able to observe quoted prices for identical assets. As a result, our determination of \u201cfair value\u201d for those assets on our balance sheet incorporates significant inputs that are not observable. Fair value is defined as an exit price representing the amount that would be received if assets were sold or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement determined based on the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nA Level 3 fair value measurement is inherently uncertain and could create additional volatility in our financial statements that is not necessarily related to the performance of our underlying assets. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we estimated the fair value discount rate for our portfolio to be 10.45% and 10.96%, respectively. Life expectancy estimates are also a significant component within our fair value measurement. If in the future we determine that a higher discount rate is required to ascribe fair value to a similarly situated portfolio of life insurance policies or that life expectancy estimates materially differ from actuarial estimates, we could experience significant losses materially affecting our results of operations. It is also possible that significant losses of this nature could at some point cause us to be out of compliance with borrowing covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements. This could in turn result in acceleration of our L Bonds, which we may not be able to repay. As a result, we may be forced to seek additional debt or equity financing to repay such debt amounts, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we are unable to repay our debt when it comes due, then our senior lender or the holders of our L Bonds, or both, would have the right to foreclose on our assets. For further disclosure relating to the risks associated with the valuation of our assets, see the risk factors below \u201cIf actuarial assumptions we obtain from third-party providers . . . ..\u201d and \u201cInaccuracies in the life expectancy estimates we use for small face policies . . .. .\u201d\nActual results from our life insurance portfolio may not match our expected results, which could adversely affect our ability to service and grow our portfolio to achieve actuarial stability.\nOur business model relies on achieving actual results that are in line with the results we expect to attain from our investments in life insurance policy assets. In this regard, we believe that the larger the portfolio we own, the greater the likelihood that we will achieve our expected results. To our knowledge, rating agencies generally suggest that portfolios of life insurance policies contain enough policies on individual lives to achieve actuarial stability in receiving expected cash flows. For instance, in a life insurance securitization methodology published in 2016, A.M. Best concluded that at least 300 lives are necessary to achieve actuarial stability, while Standard & Poor\u2019s has indicated that stability is unlikely to be achieved with less than 1,000 lives. As of December 31, 2017, we owned $1.68 billion in face value of life insurance policies covering 804 lives.\nAlthough we plan to expand the number of life insurance policies we own using proceeds raised from our securities offerings, we may change our strategy or be unable to do so if sufficient financing is unavailable or is available only on unfavorable or unacceptable terms. Furthermore, even if our portfolio reaches a size that is actuarially stable, we still may experience differences between the actuarial models we use and actual mortalities. Differences between our expectations and actuarial models, and actual mortality results, could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. In such a case, we may face liquidity problems, including difficulties servicing our remaining portfolio of policies and servicing our outstanding debt obligations. Continued or material failures to meet our expected results could decrease the attractiveness of our securities in the eyes of potential investors, thereby making it even more difficult to obtain capital needed to service our portfolio, grow the portfolio to obtain desired diversification, and service our existing debt.\nWe critically rely on debt financing for our business. Any inability to borrow could adversely affect our business operations, our ability to satisfy our debt-payment obligations and, ultimately, our prospects and viability.\nTo date, we have chosen to finance our business principally through the issuance of debt, including debt incurred by our subsidiary GWG DLP Funding IV, LLC (\u201cDLP IV\u201d) under a senior secured term loan with LNV Corporation (see Note 6) (referred to as our \u201csenior credit facility\u201d) and our L Bonds. Our senior credit facility with LNV Corporation is secured by all of the assets of DLP IV, has a maximum amount of $300 million, and the outstanding balance at December 31, 2017 was $222.5 million. Obligations under the senior credit facility with LNV Corporation have a maturity date of September 27, 2029. Our L Bonds have scheduled maturities as indicated below in the risk factor \u201cIf a significant number of holders . . . .\u201d To date, our debt arrangements are the most important sources of financing on which our business has critically relied to grow and maintain our portfolio of life insurance policies as well as service existing debt.\nOur business model relies on continued access to financing to enable us to purchase a large and diversified portfolio of life insurance policies and pay the attendant premiums and costs of maintaining the portfolio, all while satisfying our current interest and principal repayment obligations under our senior credit facility and other indebtedness. We expect that proceeds from our life insurance policies will first be used to satisfy our obligations, as determined by the agreement governing the senior credit facility. Accordingly, until we achieve sufficient cash flows derived from our portfolio of life insurance policies, we expect to rely on the proceeds from our ongoing to satisfy our ongoing financing and liquidity needs. Nevertheless, continued access to financing and liquidity under the senior credit facility (other than premium payments on existing policies pledged) or otherwise is not guaranteed. For example, general economic conditions could limit our access to financing, as could regulatory or legal pressures exerted on us, our financiers, or those involved in the procurement of financing such as brokers, dealers, and registered investment advisors. If we are unable to borrow under the senior credit facility with LNV Corporation or otherwise for any reason, or to renew or replace the senior credit facility when it comes due, our business would be adversely impacted and our ability to service and repay our debt obligations would be compromised, thereby negatively affecting our business prospects and perhaps our viability.\nOur investments in life insurance policies have inherent risks, including fraud and legal challenges to the validity of the policies, which we will be unable to eliminate and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhen we purchase a life insurance policy, we face certain risks associated with insurance fraud and other legal challenges to the validity of the policy. For example, to the extent the insured is not aware of the existence of the policy, the insured does not exist, or the insurance company does not recognize the policy, the insurance company may\ncancel or rescind the policy thereby causing the loss of an investment in that policy. In addition, if an insured\u2019s medical records have been altered in such a way as to shorten a life expectancy as reported, this may cause us to overpay for the related policy. Finally, we may experience legal challenges from insurance companies claiming that the insured failed to have an insurable interest at the time the policy was originally purchased or that the policy owner made fraudulent disclosures to the insurer at the time the policy was purchased (e.g., disclosures pertaining to the health status of the insured or the existence or sources of premium financing), or challenges from the beneficiaries of an insurance policy claiming that the sale of the policy to us was invalid.\nTo mitigate these risks, our origination practices and underwriting procedures include a current verification of coverage from the insurance company, a complete due-diligence investigation of the insured and accompanying medical records, a review of the life insurance policy application, and a requirement that the policy has been in force for at least two years. We also conduct a legal review of any premium financing associated with the policy to determine if an insurable interest existed at the time of its issuance. Nevertheless, these steps will not eliminate the risk of fraud or legal challenges to the life insurance policies we purchase. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may prove our due-diligence and risk-mitigation efforts inadequate. If a significant face amount of policies were invalidated for reasons of fraud or any other reason, our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur ownership of life insurance policies issued by insurers that are unable to pay claims presented to them could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation, our financial condition, or even our overall prospects.\nWe rely on the payment of policy claims by insurers as our most significant source of revenue collection. In essence, the life insurance assets we own represent the obligations of insurers to pay the benefit amount under the relevant policy upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, in our business, we face the \u201ccredit risk\u201d that a particular insurer will be financially unable to pay claims when and as they become due. Depending on how many policies we own that are issued by insurers having financial difficulties at the time a claim is presented for payment, this risk could be significant enough to have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation, our financial condition, or even our overall prospects.\nTo mitigate this credit risk, we generally purchase policies issued only by insurers with an investment-grade credit rating from one or more of Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s, or A.M. Best Company. As of December 31, 2017, 96.7% of the face value benefits of our life insurance policies were issued by insurers having an investment-grade rating (BBB or better) by Standard & Poor\u2019s. We also review our exposure to credit risk associated with our portfolio of life insurance policies when estimating its fair value. In evaluating the policies\u2019 credit risk we consider items such as insurance company solvency, credit risk indicators, and general economic conditions. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate credit risk exposure and to reflect this risk in our portfolio valuation, we cannot predict with any certainty whether a particular insurer will be in a financial position to satisfy amounts that it owes under life insurance policies it has issued when a claim for payment is presented.\nEvery acquisition of a life insurance policy necessarily requires us to materially rely on information provided or obtained by third parties. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information could materially and adversely affect the value of the policies we own, our results of operation and the value of our securities.\nOur acquisition of each life insurance policy is negotiated based on variables and particular facts that are unique to the policy itself and the health of the insured. The facts we obtain about the policies and the insured at the time when the policy was applied for and obtained are based on the insured\u2019s factual representations to the insurance company, and the facts the insurance company independently obtains in the course of its own due-diligence examination, such as facts concerning the health of the insured and whether or not there is an insurable interest present when the policy was issued. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information relating to a policy or insured could materially and adversely impact the value of the policies we own and could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our securities.\nOur business is subject to state regulation and changes in those laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation, could negatively affect our results of operation, financial condition and our business prospects.\nWhen we purchase a life insurance policy, we are subject to state insurance regulations. Over the past years, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of states that have adopted legislation and regulations from model laws\npromulgated by either the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) or by the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL). These laws are essentially consumer protection statutes responding to abuses that arose early in the development of our industry, some of which may persist. Today, almost every state has adopted some version of either the NAIC or NCOIL model laws, which generally require the licensing of purchasers of and brokers for life insurance policies, the filing and approval of purchase agreements, and the disclosure of transaction fees. These laws also require various periodic reporting requirements and prohibit certain business practices deemed to be abusive. State statutes typically provide state regulatory agencies with significant powers to interpret, administer, and enforce the laws relating to the purchase of life insurance policies. Under statutory authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in different ways, or issue new administrative rules, any of which could be generally adverse to our industry. Because the life insurance secondary market is relatively new and because of the history of certain abuses in the industry, we believe it is likely that state regulation will increase and grow more complex in the foreseeable future. We cannot, however, predict what any new regulation would specifically involve.\nAny adverse change in laws or regulations, or their interpretation, in one or more states in which we operate could result in our curtailment or termination of operations in such jurisdictions, or cause us to modify our operations in a way that adversely affects our results of operation. Any such action could have a corresponding material and negative impact on our financial condition and could also negatively affect our general business prospects.\nIf federal regulators or courts conclude that the purchase of life insurance in the secondary market constitutes, in all cases, a transaction in securities, we could be in violation of existing covenants under our senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, which could result in significantly diminished access to capital. We could also face increased operational expenses. The materialization of this risk could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, our ability to repay our debt, and possibly threaten the viability of our business.\nOn occasion, the SEC has attempted to regulate the purchase of non-variable universal life insurance policies as transactions in securities under federal securities laws. In July 2010, the SEC issued a Staff Report of its Life Settlement Task Force. In that report, the Staff recommended that certain types of purchased insurance policies be classified as securities. The SEC has not taken any position on the Staff Report, and there is no indication if the SEC will take any action to implement the recommendations of the Staff Report. In addition, there have been several federal court cases in which transactions involving the purchase and fractionalization of life insurance policies have been held to be transactions in securities under the federal Securities Act of 1933.\nWe believe that the matters discussed in the Staff Report and existing case law do not impact our current business model because our purchases of life insurance policies are distinguishable from those cases that have been held by courts, and advocated by the Staff Report, to be transactions in securities. For example, neither we nor any of our affiliates are involved in the fractionalization of life insurance policies, and we presently do not purchase significant amounts of variable life insurance policies. As a practical matter, if all or a majority of our life insurance policies were deemed to be \u201csecurities\u201d under federal securities laws, either through an expansion of the definition of what constitutes a \u201csecurity,\u201d the expansion of the types of transactions in life insurance policies that would constitute transactions in \u201csecurities,\u201d or the elimination or limitation of available exemptions and exceptions (whether by statutory change, regulatory change, or administrative or court interpretation), then we or one or more of our affiliated entities could become subject to the federal Investment Company Act of 1940. This outcome would likely have a material and negative effect on our Company by imposing additional regulations and rules to our governance structure, operations, and our capital structure. In particular, this outcome would likely cause us to be in violation of existing covenants under our senior credit facility with LNV Corporation requiring us not to operate or be characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This breach would likely adversely affect our liquidity and increase our cost of capital and operational expenses, all of which would adversely affect our operating results. Such an outcome could also threaten our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due and the viability of our business.\nIf actuarial assumptions we obtain from third-party providers and rely on to calculate our expected returns on our investments in life insurance policies change, our operating results and cash flow could be adversely affected, as well as the value of our collateral and our ability to service our debt obligations.\nThe expected internal rate of return we calculate is based upon the probability of an insured\u2019s mortality over an actuarial life expectancy estimate. We presently obtain these estimates from third-party medical-actuarial underwriting companies. In the case of small face policies (i.e., policies having $1.0 million or less in face value of policy benefits),\nwe may choose not to obtain any third party estimates, and instead use proprietary mortality tables or other techniques to develop our own life expectancy for an insured. In addition to actuarial life expectancies, we rely on a pricing and premium forecasting software model developed by a third-party actuarial firm for the valuation of policies we purchase, future mortality revenues, and the calculation of anticipated internal rates of return. These pricing models forecast the estimated future premiums due as well the future mortalities of insureds.\nAll actuarial life expectancies (and related forecasting software) are subject to interpretation and change based on evolving medical technology, actuarial data, and analytical techniques. Additionally, we are required under the borrowing agreement for our senior credit facility with LNV Corporation to update life expectancy estimates for life insurance policies with face amounts greater than $750,000 every two years. Our prior experience in updating life expectancies has generally resulted in longer life expectancies for most, but not all, of the insureds within our portfolio. Any increase in the actuarial life expectancy estimates of insureds within our portfolio could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow, and our balance sheet. Adverse impacts on the value of our life insurance policy portfolio or our cash flow could in turn impair the value of the collateral we have pledged to our creditors and our ability to service our debt and obligations as they come due.\nWe rely on estimated rates of mortality when valuing life insurance policies and forecasting the performance of our portfolio, and we also rely on other estimates derived from statistical methodologies for projecting our future cash flows. If any of our estimates prove to be incorrect, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to satisfy our debt service and repayment obligations.\nIf we project we will receive cash inflows from policies sooner than we actually do, we may not be able to make payment on our debt obligations in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, a significant medical discovery or advance that results in mortality improvements among seniors, above historically predicted actuarial rates, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our life insurance investments.\nFor example, we use a modeling method for projecting cash flows known as the \u201cprobabilistic method.\u201d This is an actuarial method that uses the probability of an insured\u2019s mortality over time (a mortality curve) to project the flow of policy benefits to us and to project premiums that must be paid. Thus far, we have in fact experienced fewer cash flows from policy benefits than projected in the early stages of ownership of our current life insurance policy portfolio using this method. We had expected to receive approximately $339.7 million cumulative policy benefits as of December 31, 2017, and in fact received $191.2 million. This has resulted in greater than expected premium payments, increasing such expected payments from an expected $172.1 million to $203.5 million. Barring significant mortality improvements (i.e., medical discoveries or advancements relating to the medical conditions of insureds), however, the fact that actual results have differed from the expectations derived from the probabilistic method of projecting policy benefits should ordinarily result in greater policy benefits in later stages of ownership.\nWe update our projected future cash flows each month using the probabilistic method to reflect the actual experience within our life insurance policy portfolio to date. We use the current future cash flow projection to generate our expected internal rate of return on the life insurance policy portfolio we own. We would expect to change our method of calculating our future cash flows only if leading actuarial firms determined that such a methodology was no longer the most appropriate means of projecting cash flows from a life insurance policy portfolio. Any change to the pricing model, methodology, premium forecasting assumptions, cash flow projections, or the mortality assumptions accompanied therewith that increase the projected cost-of-insurance premiums or decrease the probability of mortality could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and financial condition. Ultimately, this could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service and repayment obligations and our viability.\nCost-of-insurance (premium) increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased cost-of-insurance (\u201cCOI\u201d) charges (i.e., premium charges) for the universal life insurance policies we own in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 24% of the policies in our portfolio have premium levels that are guaranteed under the terms of the policy to keep the policy\u2019s death benefit in force even in a situation where the policy\u2019s cash account has been wholly depleted. On the remaining approximately 76% of our policies, we pay \u201cnon-guaranteed COI charges\u201d and are subject to the risk that the insurer could increase the COI charges for the policy. In all cases, the amount of increase is subject to any limits that may be set forth in the insurance policy. Because very few of the policies we own have significant cash account value balances, any COI\nincrease will require us to use more cash to satisfy the minimum premium amount required to keep the related policy in force, and this could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nA COI increase can also be expected to impair the value of the affected policy because extra expense (i.e., additional premium amounts) will be required to keep the policy in force, and such extra expense will diminish the economic value, or return, of the policy realized upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, any widespread COI increases in policies we own would likely have a material and adverse effect on the value of our portfolio, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nOur business and prospects may be adversely affected by changes, lack of growth, or increased competition in the life insurance secondary market.\nThe growth of the life insurance policy secondary market and our expansion within the market may be negatively affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including: our inability to locate sufficient numbers of life insurance policy sellers or agents to source those sellers; our inability to convince life insurance policy owners of the benefits of selling their policy; competition from other companies in the life insurance secondary market; negative publicity about the life insurance secondary market based on actual or perceived abuses; and the adoption of additional governmental regulation.\nThe relatively new and evolving nature of the market in which we operate makes the related risks difficult to identify and quantify. Nevertheless, contractions in the secondary market for life insurance policies, whether resulting from general economic conditions, regulatory or legal pressures, or otherwise (including regulatory pressures exerted on us or others involved in the secondary market for life insurance), could make participation in the market generally less desirable. This could in turn depress the prices at which life insurance policies on the secondary market are bought and sold and have a negative impact on the estimated value of the policies we own. If the value of the policies we own decreases, our results of operation and financial condition could suffer.\nChanges in general economic conditions could adversely impact our business.\nChanges in general economic conditions, including, for example, interest rates, investor sentiment, changes specifically affecting the insurance industry, competition, technological developments, political and diplomatic events, tax laws, and other factors not known to us today, can substantially and adversely affect our business and prospects. For example, changes in interest rates may increase our cost of capital and ability to raise capital and have a corresponding adverse impact on our operating results. While we may engage in certain hedging activities to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates, none of these risks are or will be within our control.\nWe are dependent on our information systems for our financial reporting, policy-related databases, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, our business and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our information systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, Internet web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and attacks from viruses or hackers, including cybersecurity threats and incidents. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to targeted measures directed at us, our databases, policies, and/or the subjects of acquired policies. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to attempt to mitigate our exposure to these risks, attacks are evolving and unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that any risk prevention measures implemented will be successful. System failures or interruptions, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could breach the security of the personal information of the subjects of the acquired policies and could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Unique to Our Company\nWe have a relatively limited history of operations and our earnings and cash flows may be volatile, resulting in uncertainty about our ability to service and repay our debt when it comes due, redeem preferred stock when requested and uncertainty about our prospects generally.\nWe are a company with a limited history, which makes it difficult to accurately forecast our earnings and cash flows. We incurred a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $33.3 million and $3.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our lack of a significant history and the evolving nature of the market in which we operate make it likely that there are risks inherent to our business that are yet to be recognized by us or others, or not fully appreciated, and that could result in us earning less than we anticipate or even suffering further losses. As a result of the foregoing, an investment in our securities necessarily involves uncertainty about the stability of our earnings, cash flows and, ultimately, our ability to service and repay our debt and our prospects generally. In addition, any earnings volatility we experience may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may in the future rely, in part, on new and unproven technology as part of our underwriting processes. If the mortality predictions we obtain through use of this technology proves inaccurate, our results of operation and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe recently exercised our option to license, on an exclusive basis for use in the life insurance industry, new technology (which we call \u201cM-Panel\u201d technology) that we believe may be applied to assist us with the mortality predictions in the course of underwriting and valuing life insurance policies. This M-Panel technology, however, has not yet been commercially applied in the manner we envision, and it is possible that we will be unable to obtain more accurate mortality predictions through its use. It is also possible that the mortality predictions we obtain through use of the M-Panel technology will prove inaccurate, and perhaps materially so. In such a case, our failure to accurately forecast mortalities could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition, which could in turn materially and negatively affect the price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debts.\nAlthough we have entered into a written license agreement for the M-Panel technology, we may have difficulties preventing third parties from using that technology, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses from other parties prior to our commercial use of that technology. We may be forced to develop our own proprietary processes, the success of which would be uncertain. Difficulties we encounter in our efforts to use or develop, and protect, intellectual property may prove costly and affect our results of operation.\nThe M-Panel technology rights we have licensed are the subject of a provisional patent application, but no patent protection will be afforded those rights unless and until a non-provisional patent application is filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which filing is beyond our control. If the patent for the M-Panel technology ultimately were to issue, we would be legally entitled to prevent third parties from using any part of the technology that is both covered by the claims of the patent and licensed to us. If, on the other hand, no patent is ultimately granted with respect to the M-Panel technology (or the scope of claims is too narrow to afford us with meaningful protection), then we may be unable to prevent third parties from using the M-Panel technology. This outcome may severely diminish any competitive advantage we hope to obtain through our use of the M-Panel technology.\nWe are aware that other patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may have scopes of claims that overlap with the claims contained in the provisional patent application filed with respect to the M-Panel technology. If those other patents were to issue with scopes of claims that in fact overlap with the claims in any patent application for the M-Panel technology, we would likely be required to enter into a license agreement with other third parties before we could use processes that are covered by those overlapping claims. Nevertheless, we may be unable to procure such a license, and even if we are able to procure such a license it may prove too costly for us. Alternatively, we would ourselves be required to develop other processes that would not overlap with other patent claims. Our own development of these processes could be costly and time consuming and may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\nIn sum, any difficulties we encounter in our efforts to use (through a license), or develop, and ultimately protect, intellectual property from which we hope to gain a competitive advantage and enter into new insurance-related markets could prove costly and time-consuming enough to materially and adversely affect our results of operation.\nThe M-Panel technology we license may subject us to claims of infringement or invalidity from third parties, and the magnitude of this risk to our business generally rises if and as we become more successful in employing and relying on the technology. Any such claims would be complex and costly, and adverse outcomes could undermine the competitive advantages we seek.\nOur reliance on M-Panel technology (or any other technology we own or license) will subject us to the risk that other parties may assert, rightly or wrongly, that our intellectual property rights are invalid or violate the rights of those parties, as well as the risk that our intellectual property rights will be infringed upon by third parties. Any outcome invalidating our intellectual property rights or otherwise diminishing the competitive advantages obtained, at least in part, through the use of those rights could have a material and adverse effect on our competitive position and our prospects.\nCommercializing the M-Panel or other technology may require significant expenses, may cause us to incur losses, and may ultimately prove ineffective or fail to create profitable business lines in the life insurance and related industries in which we operate.\nWe intend to pursue new business models and business strategies in the insurance industry with M-Panel or similar technology. This M-Panel technology, however, has not yet been commercially applied in the manner we envision, and it is possible that we will incur losses as a result of these efforts. It is also possible that we will be unable to effectively commercialize M-Panel or similar technology, or unsuccessful in disrupting the life insurance industry. One or more competitors, however, may ultimately succeed in applying technology to the life insurance industry in a manner that provides them with a significant competitive advantage or that disrupts the marketplace. Any such outcome could have a material and adverse effect on our prospects, which could in turn materially and negatively affect the price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debts.\nWe are in the final stages of readying our first scaled research pilot that will run concurrent M-Panel testing and life insurance underwriting analysis on insurance applicants. On each insurance applicant, we will compare and analyze the standard underwriting protocol against a detailed epigenetic scan of methylation patterns. Although we expect we will emerge from the pilot with a quantitative understanding of the accuracy of our M-Panel Smoking Test and Alcohol Test that will be critical in commercializing our tests for the life insurance industry, we have not yet validated the claims that we believe to be true in a large-scale study. Further, although we invest in the insurtech business overall and in research and development specifically, these activities do not guarantee that we will develop or obtain intellectual property necessary for profitable operations. Costs involved in developing and protecting rights in intellectual property may have a negative impact on our business.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our patents or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Although we have U.S. patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain.\nWe might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.\nWe may not be able to raise the capital that we are seeking from our securities offerings and may be unable to meet our overall business objective of growing a larger, actuarially diverse portfolio of life insurance.\nOur offer and sale of our Series 2 Redeemable Preferred Stock and our L Bond offerings are the principal means by which we intend to raise funds needed to meet our goal of growing a larger and more statistically diverse portfolio. While we plan to continue financing our business, if we are unable to continue to do so for any reason we may be unable to meet our goal. In addition, if actual cash flows from our portfolio of life insurance policies do not occur as\nour actuarial projections have forecasted, which has thus far been the case, we could be forced to sell our investments in life insurance policies in order to service or satisfy our debt-related obligations. If we are forced to sell some or all of our investments in life insurance policies, or our entire portfolio, we may be unable to sell them at prices we believe are optimal or that approximate the discount rate we have applied to value our portfolio, particularly if our sale of policies occurs at a time when we are (or are perceived to be) in distress. In any such event, our business and the value of our securities would likely be materially and adversely impacted.\nInaccuracies in the life expectancy estimates we use for small face policies could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we owned 502 \u201csmall face\u201d life insurance policies (i.e., policies having $1 million in face value of benefits or less) having $279.9 million in aggregate face value of benefits. We expect that the proportion of our total portfolio of life insurance policies consisting of small face policies will continue to increase in the future.\nThe underwriting processes we use to evaluate, price and purchase small face policies are different from, and may not be as reliable as, the processes we use for life insurance policies with larger face values of benefits. In particular, the processes we use to develop or obtain life expectancy estimates and the related mortality curves for small face policies are less extensive than traditional methods. These processes include obtaining either a single fully underwritten or simplified report as opposed to two fully underwritten reports. A simplified third-party underwriting report is based on a self-reported medical interview and may be supplemented with additional information obtained from a pharmacy benefit manager database which is provided to one or more medical-actuarial underwriting firms to obtain a simplified life expectancy report. Although we obtain professional actuarial guidance regarding these processes, our simplified underwriting methodology may not be as reliable as the processes we use for policies with larger (i.e., greater than $1 million) face value of benefits where two fully underwritten life expectancy reports are obtained.\nAs the face value attributable to our small face policies increases relative to the total face value of our portfolio, the accuracy with which we have estimated life expectancies for these policies will become increasingly material to our business. Any shortcomings in the processes we use to evaluate, price, purchase and value our small face policies, or significant inaccuracies in the life expectancy estimates relating to those policies, could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Any such outcomes could have a negative and possibly material effect on our ability to satisfy our debts.\nWe depend upon cash distributions from our subsidiaries, and contractual restrictions on distributions to us or adverse events at one of our operating subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our ability to pay our debts, redeem preferred stock when requested and continue operating our business.\nGWG Holdings, Inc. is a holding company. As a holding company, we conduct our operations through operating subsidiaries, and as such our most significant assets are cash and our ownership interests in our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations, including our debt-related and dividend-payment obligations, materially depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us. In this regard, the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us is, and will continue to be, restricted by certain negative covenants in the agreement governing our senior credit facility. If any of these limitations were to materially impede the flow of cash to us, our ability to service and repay our debt, including obligations under the L Bonds, and make cash dividend payments to holders of our preferred stock offerings would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any adverse corporate event at the subsidiary level, such as a declaration of bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or an event of default under our senior credit facility, could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us, and thereby materially and adversely affect our ability to service and repay our debt and make cash dividend payments, and negatively impact our ability to continue operations.\nThe collateral granted as security for our obligations under the L Bonds may be insufficient to repay the indebtedness upon an event of default.\nGWG Holdings (the issuer of the L Bonds) and GWG Life (the guarantor of obligations under the L Bonds, and the wholly owned subsidiary of GWG Holdings) have each granted a security interest in substantially all of their respective assets to serve as collateral security for obligations under the L Bonds. Importantly, DLP IV owns substantially all of our life insurance policies and is the borrower under our senior credit facility with LNV Corporation. As the borrower\nunder that senior credit facility, all of its assets - including all of its life insurance policy assets - serve as collateral for our obligations under the facility.\nThe most significant assets of each of GWG Holdings and GWG Life are their cash and investments in their respective subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, GWG Holdings\u2019 total assets were approximately $594.5 million, of which approximately $112.0 million was cash and approximately $480.7 million was its investment in subsidiaries. On that same date, GWG Life\u2019s total assets were approximately $480.7 million, of which approximately $1.5 million was cash and approximately $415.2 million was its investment in subsidiaries. Approximately $51.1 million in fair value of life insurance policies was directly owned by GWG Life at December 31, 2017.\nBecause of the fact that substantially all of our life insurance assets are held in our DLP IV subsidiary, and all of those assets serve as collateral security for our obligations under our senior credit facility, L Bond holders risk the possibility that the collateral security that has been granted for our obligations under the L Bonds may be insufficient to repay holders upon an event of default. Furthermore, while the indenture governing the L Bonds limits the amount of debt we and our subsidiaries can incur, the indenture permits us and our subsidiaries to incur additional secured debt (subject to the debt coverage ratio) that may be senior to the L Bonds.\nIf a significant number of holders of our L Bonds demand repayment of those instruments upon maturity instead of renewing them, and at such time we do not have sufficient capital on hand to fund those repayments (and do not otherwise have access to sufficient capital), we may be forced to liquidate some of our life insurance policy assets, which could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $461.4 million in principal amount of L Bonds outstanding. Since we first issued our L Bonds, we have experienced $394.9 million in maturities, of which $234.7 million has renewed for an additional term, as of December 31, 2017. This has provided us with an historical renewal rate of approximately 59.4% for investments in our L Bonds. Future contractual maturities of L Bonds as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nIf investors holding existing indebtedness which matures do not elect to renew their investments and we do not at such time have or have access to sufficient capital, then we may need to liquidate some of our investments in life insurance policies earlier than anticipated. In such an event, we may be unable to sell those policies at prices we believe are fair or otherwise appropriate and such sales could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. See also \u201cWe may not be able to raise the capital that we are seeking . . . ..\u201d\nSubordination provisions contained in the indenture will restrict the ability of the trustee or the L Bond holders to enforce their rights against us under the indenture, including the right to payment on the L Bonds, if a default then exists under a senior credit facility.\nThe L Bonds will be subordinate in right of payment to any claims of our senior lender under the senior credit facility. In this regard, subordination provisions limiting the right of L Bond holders to enforce their rights are contained in the indenture. These provisions include:\n\u2022 a prohibition on challenging any enforcement action taken by a senior lender, or interfering with any legal action or suits undertaken by a senior lender, against us and our affiliates;\n\u2022 a 180-day standstill period during which there may not be brought any action against us or our affiliates to enforce rights respecting collateral unless our senior credit facility with LNV Corporation has been repaid in full, which period may be extended if the senior lender takes action during such standstill period; and\n\u2022 a prohibition on filing a bankruptcy or insolvency case against us or our affiliates for at least one year plus one day after any senior lender has been paid in full.\nIn the event of a default on a senior credit facility, the indenture prohibits us from making any payment, direct or indirect (whether for interest, principal, as a result of any redemption or repayment at maturity, on default, or otherwise), on the L Bonds and any other indebtedness unless and until: (i) the default respecting the senior credit facility has been cured or waived or has ceased to exist; or (ii) in the case of a non-payment default that permits a senior lender to declare as due and payable all amounts owing under a senior credit facility (but where that senior lender has not yet so declared amounts as being due and payable), the end of the period commencing on the date the trustee receives written notice of default from the senior lender and ending on the earliest of (1) our discharge of the default (or other cure), (2) the trustee\u2019s receipt of a valid waiver of default from the senior lender, or (3) a written notice from the senior lender terminating the payment prohibition.\nDuring any payment prohibition period, neither the holders of the L Bonds nor the trustee will have the right, directly or indirectly, to sue to enforce the indenture or the L Bonds. Other provisions of the indenture do permit the trustee to take action to enforce the payment rights of L Bond holders after 179 days have passed since the trustee\u2019s receipt of notice of default from a senior lender, but in such case any funds paid as a result of any such suit or enforcement action shall be applied toward the senior credit facility until the facility is indefeasibly paid in full before being applied to the L Bonds.\nThese subordination provisions present the risk that, upon any default by us on obligations owed to our senior lender, the holders of the L Bonds will be unable to enforce their rights to payment.\nIf the 180-day standstill period noted above, or any other limitation on the rights of the trustee or L Bond holders to assert their rights to payment of principal or interest under the indenture, is ultimately determined to conflict with provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (most notably sections 316(b) and 317(a) of that Act), then the trustee, as well as any holder who shall not have earlier consented to such subordination provisions, will (notwithstanding such provision contained in the indenture) be authorized to institute a lawsuit for the enforcement of any payment of principal or interest after their respective due dates.\nThe debt coverage ratio, designed to provide some assurance that the value of our assets exceeds our obligations to the holders of L Bonds, values our life insurance policy assets in a manner that may not be representative of the amount we would actually receive upon a sale of those assets.\nUnder the indenture governing the L Bonds, as amended on March 27, 2018 (see Item 9B), the maximum amount of L Bonds we may issue at any time is limited to an amount such that our debt coverage ratio does not exceed 90%. This limitation is designed to provide a basis to ensure that the net present value of policy benefits from our life insurance assets, along with the value of our other asset, are able to cover the obligations to our L Bond holders. Conceptually, and because we intend to hold our life insurance policies until we receive the related policy benefits, the debt coverage ratio is based on the future receipt of our portfolio\u2019s gross expected yield (i.e., our expected gains) as measured against the future interest cost of our total debt obligations to finance the portfolio to maturity. Expressed as a percentage, the debt coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of (i) the total amounts outstanding on interest-bearing debt over (ii) the net present asset value of all life insurance assets we own, plus any cash and cash equivalents held in our accounts, policy benefit receivables and, without duplication, the value of all other assets of the Company as reflected on our most recently available balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP. For this purpose, the net present asset value of our life insurance assets is calculated as the present value of the life insurance portfolio\u2019s expected future cash flows discounted at the weighted-average interest rate of the interest-bearing indebtedness for the previous month.\nAlthough the debt coverage ratio is designed to provide a basis to ensure that our assets will be sufficient to meet our obligations to the holders of L Bonds, the \u201cnet present value\u201d of our life insurance assets used in the debt coverage ratio is not the same as the \u201cfair value\u201d of those assets on our balance sheet. Accordingly, the \u201cnet present value\u201d and the \u201cfair value\u201d of our life insurance assets may be different - greater or less - and as a result the debt coverage ratio is not informative of the amount we and holders of L Bonds would actually receive if we were forced to sell or liquidate our life insurance assets. Furthermore, any sale or liquidation of all or a significant portion of our life insurance assets would incur significant transactional costs. As a result, our mere compliance with the debt coverage ratio in the indenture will not guarantee that the value of our life insurance assets, if sold or liquidated, would in all cases exceed the amount of our obligations to the holders of L Bonds.\nOur controlling stockholders and principal executives are involved in litigation \u201cclawback\u201d claims, and it is possible that adverse outcomes from these claims could negatively affect us.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Jon R. Sabes, and our corporate secretary and Chief Operating Officer - Life Epigenetics Inc., Steven F. Sabes, who together beneficially own or control approximately 72% of our common stock, are subject to clawback litigation relating to loan payments made to Opportunity Finance, LLC. The litigation stems from loan payments received by Opportunity Finance, LLC (owned by Jon R. Sabes and Steve F. Sabes) from a borrower who filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The bankruptcy trustee alleges that loan repayments to Opportunity Finance were voidable transfers under preference or other legal theories and seeks to recover amounts for other creditors of the bankruptcy estate Case No. 08-45257 (U.S. Bankruptcy Court District of Minnesota). Such loan repayments may ultimately be deemed to be voidable transfers under preference or other legal theories. To date, no claim has been made against us.\nWhile we believe there are numerous meritorious defenses to the claims made by the bankruptcy trustee, and we are advised that the defendants in that action will vigorously defend against the trustee\u2019s claims, the defendants may not prevail. If the bankruptcy trustee were to succeed in any effort to sell or transfer the equity interests of Jon R. Sabes or Steven F. Sabes in our Company as a result of the litigation, there could be a change in control of our Company. Such an event could adversely affect holders of our L Bonds by reducing the number of shares of common stock of GWG Holdings that have been pledged as collateral security for our obligations under those securities. Finally, regardless of the outcome of this litigation, these matters may distract management and reduce the time and attention that they are able to devote to our business.\nThe loss of the services of our current executives or other key employees, or the failure to attract additional key individuals, would materially adversely affect our business operations and prospects.\nOur financial success is significantly dependent upon the efforts of our current executive officers and other key employees. We have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Jon R. Sabes and William B. Acheson. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that these individuals will continue to provide services to us. A voluntary or involuntary termination of employment could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations if we were not able to attract qualified replacements in a timely manner. At present, we do not maintain key-man life insurance policies for any of these individuals. In addition, our success and viability is also dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business, especially our sales, policy acquisition, and financial management team. If we were to lose the members of these service teams, we would need to replace them with qualified individuals in a timely manner or our business operations and prospects could be adversely impacted.\nWe have the discretion to purchase assets, including life insurance assets, through different subsidiaries, and to transfer assets among our subsidiaries. Any decision to purchase or hold title to assets in one subsidiary, as opposed to a different subsidiary, may affect the value of collateral security for our debts.\nWe may at our discretion direct the purchase of policies by, and the sale of policies and other assets amongst, different subsidiaries of GWG Holdings. Purchases of assets in, or movements of assets amongst, different subsidiaries could affect the value of the collateral security for obligations under the L Bonds. For example, purchases through, or transfers of life insurance policies to, DLP IV would cause the policies acquired or transferred to become collateral for our senior credit facility with LNV Corporation, whereas purchases through, or transfers of life insurance policies to, GWG Life would cause the policies acquired by GWG Life to become collateral for the L Bonds. Accordingly, purchases of assets through, or transfers of assets to, different subsidiaries may affect the value of collateral security for different classes of holders of our debt.\nBeing a public company is expensive and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nWe have been a public reporting company since January 31, 2012. As such, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements generate significant accounting, legal, and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly than they would otherwise be, and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. These rules and regulations applicable to public companies, and the risks involved in serving as an officer or director of a public company, may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under federal securities laws, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make it more difficult to compare our financial statements to those of other issuers that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements normally applicable to public companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation, and delayed adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards. We could be an emerging growth company through 2019, although certain circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. It is possible that these reduced reporting requirements could make it more difficult for investors to compare our results of operations and financial condition with those of other companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe have a merchant cash advance business that presents a number of unique risks.\nIn February 2016, we acquired certain loan and advance assets from a lender to merchant cash advance funders. A merchant cash advance funder provides small businesses with one or more cash advances structured as the purchase of a portion of a small business\u2019s future receipts. This type of transaction is not characterized or structured as a loan. Small businesses typically seek these advances for working capital purposes to finance their purchase of inventory, equipment, or to otherwise address immediate business needs.\nOur activities in this space are currently not significant to our Company as a whole and do we intend to originate any additional cash advances. Nevertheless, this business presents a number of unique risks, including the illiquidity of the cash advances; our critical reliance on certain individuals to operate the business; collection and cash advance repayment issues and challenges given that the merchant cash advances are typically unsecured; and sensitivity to general economic conditions.\nRisks Related to the Pending Exchange Transaction\nWe may not complete the Exchange Transaction within our anticipated timeframe or at all, or on the terms and conditions presently set forth in the Master Exchange Agreement.\nWe have entered into a Master Exchange Agreement (the \u201cMaster Agreement\u201d) to govern our contemplated securities exchange transaction with The Beneficient Company Group, L.P. (\u201cBeneficient\u201d) and certain other parties (the \u201cExchange Transaction\u201d). Completion of the Exchange Transaction is subject to various conditions. These conditions include, among other things, the negotiation and entry into various ancillary agreements, obtaining requisite third party consents, receipt by our Board of Directors of a reasonably acceptable valuation opinion and a fairness opinion, and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Acts of 1976. Although we anticipate consummating the Exchange Transaction during the second quarter of 2018, there is no guarantee that it will be completed on this timeframe or at all. If the Exchange Transaction is not completed for any reason, we will not realize the anticipated benefits of the Exchange Transaction described elsewhere in this report. Further, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the Exchange Transaction will be completed. In addition, significant costs related to the Exchange Transaction, such as legal, accounting, financial valuation and filing fees, must be paid and expended even if the Exchange Transaction is not completed. Many of these costs, which we expect to capitalize upon consummation of the Exchange Transaction, must be expensed by us if the Exchange Transaction is not completed. Such expenses will have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results, which may further depress the market price of our common stock.\nBeneficient may be unable to operate its business successfully, which would negatively impact its ability to generate distributable cash flow and increase the value of its common units.\nBeneficient plans to provide to mid-to-high net worth individuals (i.e., individuals having a net worth of between $5 million and $30 million) with trust services and related liquidity products and loans (collectively, \u201ctrust services and liquidity products\u201d) for the alternative assets and illiquid investment funds those individuals may own, and a variety of other financial services, including custody and clearing of alternative assets, fund and trust administration, retirement funds and insurance services for covering risks attendant to owning or managing alternative assets. The\nsuccess of the Exchange Transaction from our perspective will depend, in part, on Beneficient\u2019s ability to operate its business successfully, generate distributable cash flow and increase the value of its common units. If Beneficient is unable to do so, such inability will negatively impact the value of our investment in Beneficient.\nBeneficient\u2019s operations will impact our financial performance.\nWe expect to account for our acquisition of common units of Beneficient using the equity method of accounting. As a result, following the closing of the Exchange Transaction, we will recognize a share of the profits and losses of Beneficient in the periods when such profits and losses are earned or incurred by Beneficient. Because common units of Beneficient will represent a significant percent of our assets, the impact on our financial statements of Beneficient\u2019s financial performance may be material.\nBeneficient may be unable to obtain a listing of its common units on a nationally recognized stock exchange, which would hinder Beneficient\u2019s ability to successfully pursue its current business plans.\nBeneficient is a privately-held company organized as a Delaware master limited partnership. Subject to receipt of regulatory trust charters from the State of Texas, which is not a certainty, Beneficient intends to register its common units with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to apply for listing on a national stock exchange (a \u201clisting\u201d), after which it would be considered a publicly traded partnership for IRS purposes. There can be no assurance as to the timing or effectiveness, if any, of the proposed listing. Because Beneficient\u2019s current business plans are based in part on obtaining a listing, failure to do so may materially and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects, which would likely decrease the value of Beneficient\u2019s common units. As a potential significant holder of Beneficient common units, such a decrease would have a corresponding negative impact on the value of our assets and the price of our common stock.\nUnder the Master Agreement, Beneficient has agreed to use its commercial best efforts to pursue and obtain a listing following the closing of the Exchange Transaction. If Beneficient fails to file a registration statement with the SEC in connection with a listing within 24 months after such closing, or secure a listing on or prior to the 40-month anniversary of such closing, then the Master Agreement provides that we may, at our election, cause Beneficient to adopt a strategy to redeem all of the common units of Beneficient then held by us at a redemption price equal to the greater of $11.00 per unit or the book value per unit as of the redemption date. Under this strategy, Beneficient would be required to use a portion of its distributable cash flow to satisfy our redemption election (together with all other redemption elections that may be made by the holders of other interests in Beneficient or interests convertible into interests of Beneficient). However, there is no assurance that Beneficient\u2019s distributable cash flow will be sufficient to affect a redemption within a particular period of time or at all. If Beneficient is ultimately unable to satisfy its redemption obligation, we may not be able to recoup our investment in Beneficient common units.\nWe will have limited or no ability to influence Beneficient\u2019s management\u2019s decisions regarding its business.\nAlthough we will own a significant percentage of Beneficient\u2019s outstanding common units upon consummation of the Exchange Transaction, Beneficient\u2019s general partner is authorized to perform all acts that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out Beneficient\u2019s purposes and to conduct its business. As a result, we will have only limited voting rights relating to certain matters and, as is contemplated by the terms of Beneficient\u2019s limited partnership agreement (which we will be required to become a party to upon consummation of the Exchange Transaction), any person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of Beneficient\u2019s common limited partnership units (including GWG) will lose voting rights associated with all of its common units and such common units may not be voted on any matter. Further, any person or group (other than Beneficient\u2019s general partner and its affiliates, or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of the general partner or its affiliates or such person or group has the prior approval of the board of directors of the general partner of Beneficient) who acquires, in the aggregate, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of Beneficient\u2019s common units (including GWG), will lose voting rights associated with all of its common units and such common units may not be voted on any matter and will not be considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of limited partners, calculating required votes, determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes. In addition, prior to a listing, if any, of Beneficient\u2019s common units on a national stock exchange or, in lieu thereof, quotation of the common units in an automated quotation system, the executive committee of the board of directors of the general partner of Beneficient will be entitled to cast all of the votes that the limited partners would otherwise be entitled to cast, and no limited partner, in its capacity as such, will be permitted\nto vote in respect of its common units. As a result, we will have limited or no ability to influence Beneficient\u2019s management\u2019s decisions regarding its business.\nBeneficient\u2019s partnership agreement eliminates fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed to us under Delaware law.\nBeneficient\u2019s business and affairs are managed by Beneficient Management, LLC, its general partner (\u201cBeneficient Management\u201d). Beneficient\u2019s partnership agreement eliminates the fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed by the Beneficient Management under Delaware law and replaces them with the duties expressly set forth in such agreement. Beneficient\u2019s partnership agreement provides that, when the general partner is permitted or required to make a decision in its \u201cdiscretion\u201d or pursuant to a provision not subject to an express standard of \u201cgood faith,\u201d in making such decision, the general partner has no duty to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting Beneficient or any other person. If a decision under Beneficient\u2019s partnership agreement is subject to an express standard of \u201cgood faith,\u201d such decision will not constitute a breach of the agreement if the decision is approved by (i) a majority of the members of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner of Beneficient, (ii) holders of a majority of the voting power of the Beneficient\u2019s common units entitled to vote (excluding voting common units owned by the general partner and its affiliates), or (iii) the general partner acting without a subjective belief that such decision was adverse to the interests of Beneficient. Potential conflicts of interest may arise among the general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Beneficient, on the other hand, and the general partner may be able to favor its own interest to the detriment of Beneficient and the holders of the common units.\nOur percentage ownership in Beneficient may be diluted.\nUpon consummation of the Exchange Transaction, we will become the owner of up to 82% of the issued and outstanding common units in Beneficient. Our percentage ownership does not take into account (i) approximately 125,657,883 limited partner interests that may be issued upon the conversion of outstanding securities issued by Beneficient or its affiliates, or (ii) additional limited partner interests that may be issued after the closing of the Exchange Transaction. Importantly, the general partner of Beneficient has discretion to cause Beneficient to issue additional limited partner interests from time to time, and Beneficient\u2019s partnership agreement contains no meaningful restrictions on this authority. Moreover, the Beneficient organizational structure permits the future issuance of additional securities that can, upon certain circumstances or at the discretion of their holders, be converted into additional limited partner interests in Beneficient. As a result, our percentage ownership in Beneficient may be diluted in the future.\nThe resale of our common stock issued in the Exchange Transaction could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock and result in a destabilized trading market for our common stock.\nWe may issue up to 40 million shares of our common stock upon closing of the Exchange Transaction, which would represent approximately 688% of the 5,813,555 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 29, 2018. Upon issuance, the shares of common stock we issue in the Exchange Transaction will be subject to resale restrictions applicable to \u201crestricted securities\u201d under applicable federal securities. The Master Agreement and related ancillary agreements require that we register the resale of the shares issued to the Seller Trusts (up to 29.1 million shares) to the extent permitted by applicable SEC rules and regulations. The shares of our common stock that we may issue in the Exchange Transaction to MHT SPV are not contemplated to be included among the securities to be registered for resale, and such shares will subject to a lock-up provision that will prohibit MHT SPV from reselling them until 40 months following the closing of the Exchange Transaction or, if earlier, the listing of the common units of Beneficient on a nationally recognized stock exchange. Upon the effectiveness of such registration, or the lapse of applicable resale restrictions under applicable securities laws or applicable lock-up restrictions, the shares of our common stock issued in the Exchange Transaction will be available for resale in the public equity markets. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of these shares or the availability of these shares for future sale will have on the market price of our common stock.\nThe Master Agreement obligates us and the Seller Trusts to negotiate in good faith the terms of an Orderly Marketing Agreement with one or more nationally recognized investment banks, and enter into that agreement at the closing, for the orderly marketing and resale of the shares of our common stock that we issue to the Seller Trusts in the Exchange Transaction. The purpose of this Orderly Marketing Agreement is to manage the timing and amount of our common shares that are publicly resold in the market because the number of shares of our common stock to be issued in the Exchange Transaction will substantially increase the total number of our issued and outstanding shares. However,\nthe terms of that Orderly Marketing Agreement have not yet been determined. There is no assurance that the Orderly Marketing Agreement will accomplish its purpose of maintaining a stable market for our common stock.\nUpon consummation of the Exchange Transaction, the Seller Trusts and MHT SPV, collectively, will own a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock.\nAt the closing of the Exchange Transaction, we may issue up to 29.1 million shares of our common stock to the Seller Trusts and up to 12.5 million additional shares of our common stock to MHT SPV. Upon issuance, such shares will represent a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock. The Master Agreement contemplates and requires the delivery at closing of a shareholders\u2019 agreement (the \u201cShareholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d) among the Seller Trusts, MHT SPV and GWG Holdings. The purpose of the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement is to limit the voting power of the Seller Trusts and MHT SPV and the control they would otherwise be entitled to exercise over our Company. To that end, the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement will provide that all voting securities of GWG Holdings over which the Seller Trusts and MHT SPV (and their respective transferees) have voting control will be voted solely in proportion with the votes cast by all other holders of voting securities of GWG on any matter put before them. In addition, until the earlier of (i) one year from the closing of the Exchange Transaction and (ii) the termination of the Orderly Marketing Agreement, the Seller Trusts (including their assignees and transferees, and their respective affiliates) will be subject to certain standstill restrictions that will prohibit the Seller Trusts from, among other things, acquiring any of our voting securities, seeking or proposing to influence or control our management, Board of Directors, or policies, and submitting a proposal for any merger, recapitalization, reorganization, business combination, or other extraordinary transaction involving our Company. Following expiration of the standstill period, however, the Seller Trusts, to the extent they continue to hold shares of our common stock, may engage in such activities.", "PERMNO": 14930, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "GWGH"}
