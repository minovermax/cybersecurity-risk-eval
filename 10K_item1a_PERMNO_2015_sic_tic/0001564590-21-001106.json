Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risks that could affect our business and our results of operations. The risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY GENERALLY\nThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, continues to spread within the United States and many other parts of the world and may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow.\nAs the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow both in the U.S. and globally, there has been significant volatility in the financial markets and the adoption of emergency legislation to address the negative impacts of the pandemic. The severity, magnitude, and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing, and hard to predict. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the potential adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy, our supply chain partners, our employees and customers, customer sentiment in general, and traffic within shopping centers, and, where applicable, malls, containing our stores. As the pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state, and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine may increase, which has already affected, and may continue to affect, traffic to the Vintage Stock store. During our 2020 fiscal year, for example, in response to the crisis and as a result of government mandates, Vintage Stock\u2019s stores were closed on average 45 days. In addition, a COVID-19 outbreak could cause Marquis Industries and/or Precision to shut down one or more production plants, resulting in reduced capacity and possible delivery delays. Continued impacts of the pandemic could materially adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity, and cash flows, and may require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, employee furloughs, reduced store hours, store closings, expense reductions or discounting of pricing of our products, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak within the U.S., the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation continues to develop, the breadth of its spread and the range of governmental and community reactions thereto, there is uncertainty around its duration and ultimate impact; therefore, any negative impact on our business, financial condition (including without limitation our liquidity), results of operations, prospects, and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to extended disruption of economic activity and the impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and workforce availability could be material.\nOur results of operations could fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nOur operating results have historically fluctuated significantly, and we could continue to experience fluctuations or revert to declining operating results due to factors that may or may not be within our control. Such factors include the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuating demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions and the amount of consumers\u2019 discretionary spending,\n\u2022\nchanges in technologies favored by consumers,\n\u2022\nthe effect of the Chapter 11 Case on the Company and on the interests of various constituents;\n\u2022\ncustomer refunds or cancellations, and\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to bill through existing means;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our services or products;\n\u2022\nnew product offerings or price competition (or pricing changes) by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nwith respect to our retail segment, the opening of new stores by competitors in our markets;\n\u2022\nwith respect to our manufacturing segment, changes in import tariffs;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of expenditures for the acquisition of new businesses and the expansion of our operations, including the hiring of new employees, capital expenditures, and related costs (including wage cost increases due to historically low unemployment);\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties or failures affecting our systems in general;\n\u2022\nthe fixed nature of a significant amount of our operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our check processing service providers to continue to process and provide billing information.\nOur obligations under our consolidated indebtedness are significant.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we had $85.3 million of total consolidated indebtedness outstanding consisting of:\nThese financial obligations may have important negative consequences for us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments;\n\u2022\nrestricting our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments and other payments;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nexposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under certain of our credit facilities;\n\u2022\ncausing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have expanded our business over the past few years through the acquisition of different businesses in different industries and we intend to continue to acquire additional businesses (and possibly in different industries) in the future. Significant expansion of our present operations will be required to capitalize on potential growth in market opportunities and will require us to add additional management personnel and continue to upgrade our financial and management systems and controls and information technology infrastructure. Any further expansion will also place a significant strain on our existing management, operational, and financial resources. In order to manage our growth, we will be required to continue to implement and improve our operational, marketing, and financial systems, to expand existing operations, to attract and retain superior management and personnel, and to train, manage, and expand our employee base. There is no assurance that we will be able to expand our operations effectively, our systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our expanded operations, and our management may fail to implement our business plan successfully.\nWe may not be able to secure additional capital to expand our existing operations.\nAlthough we currently have no material long-term needs for capital expenditures at our existing operating subsidiaries, we will likely be required to make increased capital expenditures to fund our anticipated growth of operations, infrastructure, and personnel. In the future, we may need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt (including convertible debt) or equity, depending upon our results of operations, market conditions, or unforeseen needs or opportunities. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe pace of expansion of our operations;\n\u2022\nour need to respond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nfuture acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses.\nThe sale of equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe have identified and disclosed in this Form 10-K material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results, which could cause our stock price to fall or result in our stock being delisted.\nWe need to devote significant resources and time to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d) with respect to internal control over financial reporting. In addition, Section 404 under Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we assess the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting, which are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports.\nAs reported in Part II - Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, there were material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting at September 30, 2020. Specifically, management\u2019s assessment concluded that the Company has the following material weaknesses: (a) lack of sufficient controls around the financial reporting process; (b) lack of proper segregation of duties within the financial reporting process; and (c) lack of evaluation of internal controls.\nWe expect our systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate acquisitions and as our business grows. To effectively manage our company today and this anticipated complexity, we need to remediate these material weaknesses and continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Any failure to remediate these material weaknesses and implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation or operation of these controls, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, or make it more difficult to raise capital (or, if we are able to raise such capital, make such capital more expensive), one or more of which could adversely affect our business and/or jeopardize our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, any of which would harm our stock price.\nOur failure to comply with various applicable federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business.\nVarious federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees. These laws and regulations relate to matters such as employment discrimination, wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers\u2019 compensation rules, healthcare laws and regulations (including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic), and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws. Complying with these laws and regulations subjects us to substantial expense and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. We could suffer losses from these and similar cases, and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate, and the federal government have from time-to-time enacted minimum wage increases, changes to eligibility for overtime pay, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals, and similar requirements. These changes have increased our labor costs and may have a further negative impact on our labor costs in the future.\nIn addition, a significant number of our employees are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage. Federal, state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters could, to the extent implemented, materially increase our labor and other costs. Several states in which we operate have approved minimum wage increases that are above the federal minimum. As more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, we expect our labor costs will continue to increase. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by prices depends on willingness of our customers to pay the higher prices and our perceived value relative to competitors. Our distributors and suppliers could also be affected by higher minimum wage, benefit standards and compliance costs, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends both on our internally developed technology and licensed third-party technology. We rely on a variety of trademarks, service marks, and designs to promote our brand names and identity. We also rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures, and trademark, copyright, trade secrecy, unfair competition, and other intellectual property laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our products and services. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property and may not prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that courts will always uphold our intellectual property rights or enforce the contractual arrangements that we have entered into to obtain and protect our proprietary technology.\nThird parties, including our partners, contractors, or employees may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and other proprietary rights. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights, which may result in the dilution of the brand identity of our services.\nWe may decide to initiate litigation in order to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial expense and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or services infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Any such claim or litigation against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. In addition, such claims or litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using any of our products and services that incorporate the subject intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue;\n\u2022\nattempt to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed or misappropriated, which license may not be available on reasonable terms; and\n\u2022\nattempt to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, rename our products or services to avoid infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may be costly and time-consuming.\nEven if we were to prevail, such claims or litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and could result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention. These expenses and diversion of managerial resources could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims that create uncertainty about ownership or use of technology essential to our business and divert our managerial and other resources.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties may, in the future, claim our current or future services, products, trademarks, technologies, business methods or processes infringe their intellectual property rights, or challenge the validity of our intellectual property rights. We may be subject to patent infringement claims or other intellectual property infringement claims that would be costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain critical technologies or business methods. We may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions.\nThe defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can become very costly and may divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. We may not prevail in any of these suits or proceedings. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could require us to pay substantial compensatory and exemplary damages, could restrain us from using critical technologies, business methods or processes, and could result in us losing, or not gaining, valuable intellectual property rights.\nFurthermore, due to the voluminous amount of discovery frequently conducted in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential information could be disclosed to competitors during this type of litigation. In addition, public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation could be perceived negatively by investors, and thus have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nData breaches involving customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues.\nWe store confidential information with respect to our customers and employees. A compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact could result in information related to our customers or employees being obtained by unauthorized persons. Any such breach of our systems could lead to fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us or other operational problems or interruptions in connection with such breaches. Any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that others with whom we interact will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, cash flows and liquidity and possibly, subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace.\nAlso, the interpretation and enforcement of data protection laws in the United States are uncertain and, in certain circumstances contradictory. These laws may be interpreted and enforced in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and practices. If we are subject to data security breaches or government-imposed fines, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could adversely affect profitability, or be subject to substantial costs related to compliance.\nTax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\nWe are involved in an ongoing SEC investigation, which could divert management\u2019s focus, result in substantial investigation expenses and have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and a letter from the SEC stating that it is conducting an investigation. The subpoena requested documents and information concerning, among other things, the restatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, the acquisition of Marquis Industries, Inc., Vintage Stock, Inc., and ApplianceSmart, Inc., and the change in auditors. On August 12, 2020, three of the Company\u2019s corporate executive officers (together, the \u201cExecutives\u201d) each received a \u201cWells Notice\u201d from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company\u2019s SEC investigation. On October 7, 2020, the Company received a \u201cWells\nNotice\u201d from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Company\u2019s previously-disclosed SEC investigation. The Wells Notices relate to, among other things, the Company\u2019s reporting of its financial performance for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, certain disclosures related to executive compensation, and its previous acquisition of ApplianceSmart. A Wells Notice is neither a formal charge of wrongdoing nor a final determination that the recipient has violated any law. The Wells Notices informed the Company and the Executives that the SEC Staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Company and each of the Executives that would allege certain violations of the federal securities laws. The Company and the Executives maintain that their actions were appropriate, and the Company and the Executives have engaged Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, among others, to defend themselves, and intend to vigorously defend against any and all allegations brought forth.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company received a letter from the SEC requesting information regarding a potential violation of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, based upon the timing of the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2018. The Company provided a response to the SEC on October 26, 2018. The Company is cooperating with the SEC in its inquiry.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY\nWe may not be able to identify, acquire or establish control of, or effectively integrate previously acquired businesses, which could materially adversely affect our growth.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of new businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although we regularly evaluate such opportunities, we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities, obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms or at all to fund such strategic transactions, complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses with our existing businesses, or manage profitable acquired businesses or strategic investments.\nThe acquisition of a company or business is accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of due diligence during the acquisition process;\n\u2022\nadverse short-term effects on reported operating results;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key partners or key personnel in connection with, or as the result of, a transaction;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with clients of the acquired business, or our own customers, partners or employees, as a result of any integration of operations or the expansion of our offerings;\n\u2022\nthe recording of goodwill and intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and resources;\n\u2022\nthe risk of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience, including the integration or removal of the acquired or disposed products with or from our existing products; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to properly implement or remediate internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to our acquisition were not subject to federal securities laws and may have lacked appropriate controls, procedures and policies.\nThe acquisition of new businesses is costly and such acquisitions may not enhance our financial condition.\nOur growth strategy is to acquire companies and identify and acquire assets and technologies from companies in various industries that have a demonstrated history of strong earnings potential. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expend significant resources to undertake business, financial, and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition target and there is no guarantee that we will acquire the company after completing due diligence.\nOur acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or convertible debt securities, significant amortization expenses related to goodwill, and other intangible assets and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of the acquired companies. To the extent that the goodwill arising from the acquisitions carried on the financial statements do not pass the annual goodwill impairment test, excess goodwill will be charged to, and reduce, future earnings.\nBecause we do not intend to use our own employees or members of management to run the daily operations at our acquired companies, business operations might be interrupted if employees at the acquired businesses were to resign.\nAs part of our acquisition strategy, we do not use our own employees or members of our management team to operate the acquired companies. Key members of management at these acquired companies have been in place for several years and have established relationships with their customers. Competition for executive-level personnel is strong and we can make no assurance that we will be able to retain these key members of management. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of these key members of management and provide incentives to stay with the business after it\u2019s been acquired, if such key persons were to resign, we might face impairment of relationships with remaining employees or customers, which might cause long-term customers to terminate their relationships with the acquired companies, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR RETAIL SEGMENT\nVintage Stock\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. could adversely affect demand for the products we sell.\nSales of products by Vintage Stock are driven, in part, by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing movies, games, music, and other discretionary products when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many economic factors outside of our control. Some of these factors include consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, political conditions and the effect of weather, natural disasters, and civil disturbances. These and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for Vintage Stock\u2019s products, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe video game industry is cyclical and affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, two of which were released in Fall 2020. The introduction of these new consoles could negatively impact the demand for existing products or Vintage Stock\u2019s pre-owned business.\nThe video game industry has been cyclical in nature in response to the introduction and maturation of new technology. Two new consoles were introduced in November 2020. Following the introduction of new video game consoles, sales of these consoles and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate toward the new platforms. There is no guaranty that Vintage Stock will be allocated any of these new consoles for sale to its customers, or, if it is allocated new consoles for sale, that such allocation will be sufficient to meet customer demand. If the new video game consoles are not successful, or makers of video games do not make games to play on these new consoles, or games that the public finds interesting to play, Vintage Stock\u2019s sales of new video game products could decline. In addition, the new consoles are \u201cbackwards compatible,\u201d meaning that games on the prior generation consoles can also be played on these new consoles. As a result, our customers may not be incentivized to sell to us or trade in their older games, resulting in less used product, which could negatively impact Vintage Stock\u2019s pre-owned business, which in turn could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and liquidity.\nTechnological advances in the delivery and types of video, video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower Vintage Stock\u2019s sales\nWhile it is currently possible to download video, video game content, and music to the current generation of video and gaming systems, downloading is somewhat constrained by bandwidth capacity and video game and movie file sizes. However, broadband speeds are increasing and downloading technology is becoming more prevalent and continues to evolve rapidly. The current game consoles from Sony and Microsoft have facilitated download technology. If these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers\u2019 ability to access and download the current format of video, music and games and incremental content from their games and videos through these and other sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase videos, DVDs, video games and music in our stores or reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of video, digital and game delivery. As a result, our sales and earnings could decline.\nVintage Stock may not compete effectively as browser, mobile and social video viewing and gaming becomes more popular.\nListening to music, gaming, and viewing video and digital content continues to evolve rapidly. The popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming have increased greatly, and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile and social video viewing, listening to music and gaming is accessed through hardware other than the game consoles and traditional hand-held video and game devices we currently sell. If there is continued growth in popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be impacted negatively.\nSales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and Vintage Stock\u2019s, and our, financial results may be adversely affected as a result.\nMany popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an \u201cM\u201d or \u201cT\u201d rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nApplianceSmart\nApplianceSmart is subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of its creditors and other third parties who have interests in the Chapter 11 Case that may be inconsistent with ApplianceSmart\u2019s plans.\nApplianceSmart is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with its voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code filed with the Bankruptcy Court on December 9, 2019 (the \u201cCommencement Date\u201d). For the duration of the bankruptcy proceedings, ApplianceSmart\u2019s operations and our ability to execute the ApplianceSmart business strategy will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include:\n\u2022\nApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Case from time to time;\n\u2022\nApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to develop, execute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 Case, views and objections of creditors and other parties in interest that may make it difficult to develop and consummate a plan in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain normal payment and other terms with credit card companies, customers, vendors, and service providers;\n\u2022\nApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to maintain contracts that are critical to its operations;\n\u2022\nApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to attract, motivate and retain management and other key employees;\n\u2022\nApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to retain key vendors or secure alternative supply sources;\n\u2022\nApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to fund and execute its business plan; and\n\u2022\nApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate financing.\nThese risks and uncertainties could significantly affect its business and operations in various ways. For example, negative publicity or events associated with the Chapter 11 Case could adversely affect its relationships with its vendors and employees, as well as with customers, which in turn could adversely affect its operations and financial condition. Also, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, ApplianceSmart requires Bankruptcy Court approval for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit its ability to respond to certain events in a timely manner or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Case, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Case will have on ApplianceSmart\u2019s or the Company\u2019s consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations, or the certainty as to ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of the Chapter 11 Case, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, ApplianceSmart may sell or otherwise dispose of a portion or all of our assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.\nApplianceSmart\u2019s businesses could suffer from a long and protracted restructuring.\nApplianceSmart\u2019s future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. Failure to obtain this approval in a timely manner could adversely affect ApplianceSmart\u2019s operating results and cash flows, as its ability to obtain financing to fund its operations may be adversely affected by protracted bankruptcy proceedings. If a protracted reorganization or liquidation is to occur, there is a significant risk that ApplianceSmart\u2019s enterprise value would be substantially eroded to the detriment of all stakeholders.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities of ApplianceSmart that will be subject to the plan of reorganization. Even if a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders to do business with a company that may have recently emerged from bankruptcy.\nOperating as a Debtor in Possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code may restrict ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to pursue its business strategies.\nUnder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, transactions outside the ordinary course of business will be subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit ApplianceSmart\u2019s ability to respond to certain events in a timely manner or take advantage of certain opportunities. ApplianceSmart must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with its various stakeholders;\n\u2022\nbuy or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business; and\n\u2022\nborrow funds for our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our best interest.\nSufficient debtor-in-possession financing may not be available and ApplianceSmart\u2019s emergence from the Chapter 11 Case is not assured.\nIf cash flows and borrowings under any debtor-in-possession financing are not sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, it is uncertain whether we would be able to reorganize our business. The amount of distributions that will be available to our creditors and other holders of claims against and interests in us and our businesses, including\nholders of secured claims, in connection with our reorganization and consummating a plan of reorganization is uncertain. We will likely incur significant costs in connection with developing and seeking approval of a plan of reorganization, and financing, which may not be supported by certain of our stakeholders. If we were unable to develop a feasible plan of reorganization, or if we were unable to gain access to financing to operate our businesses during the Chapter 11 Case, it is possible that ApplianceSmart would have to liquidate a portion or all of its assets, in which case it is likely that holders of claims would receive substantially less favorable distributions than they would receive if ApplianceSmart were to emerge as a viable, reorganized business.\nOur senior management team and other key personnel may not be able to execute the ApplianceSmart business plan as currently developed, given the substantial attention required of such individuals by the Chapter 11 Case.\nThe execution of the ApplianceSmart business plan also depends on the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel to execute the ApplianceSmart business plan. Such individuals may be required to devote significant efforts to the prosecution of the Chapter 11 Case, thereby potentially impairing their abilities to execute the ApplianceSmart business plan and the business plan of the Company generally. Accordingly, our business plan may not be implemented as anticipated, which may cause its financial results to materially deviate from the current projections.\nApplianceSmart may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Case, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and profitability.\nThe Bankruptcy Code generally provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation and specified debts arising afterwards. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to the Commencement Date and before confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any material claims not ultimately discharged by the Bankruptcy Court could have an adverse effect on ApplianceSmart\u2019s results of operations and profitability.\nIn certain limited instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 Case to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for under a Chapter 11 proceeding because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nApplianceSmart\u2019s, and our consolidated, financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nWhile in Chapter 11, we expect that ApplianceSmart\u2019s, and our consolidated, financial results may be volatile as asset impairments and dispositions, restructuring activities, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance may not be indicative of our financial performance after the Commencement Date. In addition, if ApplianceSmart emerges from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, as a result of revisions to ApplianceSmart\u2019s operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. Moreover, if ApplianceSmart emerges from Chapter 11, we may be required to adopt fresh-start accounting. If fresh-start accounting is applicable, our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh-start reporting date. The fair value of our assets and liabilities may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. If fresh-start accounting is required, our financial results after the application of fresh-start accounting may be materially different from historical trends.\nApplianceSmart may not have sufficient cash to maintain its operations during the Chapter 11 Case or fund its emergence from the bankruptcy.\nBecause of ApplianceSmart\u2019s financial condition, it will have heightened exposure to, and less ability to withstand, the operating risks that are customary in its industry, such as fluctuations in raw material prices and currency exchange rates. Any of these factors could result in the need for substantial additional funding. A number of other factors, including the Chapter 11 Case, ApplianceSmart\u2019s financial results in recent years and the competitive environment it faces, adversely affect the availability and terms of funding that might be available to ApplianceSmart during, and upon emergence from, Chapter 11. As such, ApplianceSmart may not be able to source capital at rates acceptable to it, or at all, to fund its current operations or our exit from bankruptcy. The inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on ApplianceSmart and on its ability to sustain our operations, both currently and upon emergence from bankruptcy.\nA disruption in ApplianceSmart\u2019s relationships with, or in the operations of, any of ApplianceSmart\u2019s key suppliers could cause ApplianceSmart\u2019s, and our, net sales and profitability to decline.\nThe success of ApplianceSmart\u2019s business and growth strategy depends to a significant degree on the availability of open box and b-line product from our suppliers. ApplianceSmart does not have long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with its any of its suppliers. ApplianceSmart typically orders its inventory through the issuance of individual purchase orders to vendors allowing ApplianceSmart to remain selective of the quality and type of product it purchases. ApplianceSmart has no contractual assurance of the continued supply of merchandise in the amount and assortment currently offered to its customers and may be subjected to rationing by suppliers. In addition, ApplianceSmart relies heavily on a relatively small number of suppliers.\nApplianceSmart\u2019s suppliers also provide it with specific types of marketing allowances and volume rebates. If ApplianceSmart\u2019s suppliers fail to continue these incentives, it could have a materially adverse effect on the breadth at which the Company can achieve brand awareness that translates to net sales.\nThe financial condition of ApplianceSmart\u2019s suppliers may also adversely affect their access to capital liquidity with which to maintain their inventory, production levels and product quality and to operate their businesses, all of which could adversely affect its supply chain. Negative impacts on the financial condition of any of ApplianceSmart\u2019s suppliers may cause suppliers to reduce their offerings of customer incentives and vendor allowances, cooperative marketing expenditures and product promotions. It may also cause them to change their pricing policies, which could impact the demand for their products.\nRisk Factors Specific to Both ApplianceSmart and Vintage Stock\nAs a seller of certain consumer products, Vintage Stock and ApplianceSmart are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and statutes related to product safety and consumer protection.\nWhile we take steps to comply with these laws, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We may also be subject to involuntary or voluntary product recalls or product liability lawsuits. Direct costs or reputational damage associated with product recalls or product liability lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on future revenues and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nInternational events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers.\nSome of our suppliers rely on foreign sources to manufacture a portion of the products we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us, which could lower our sales and profitability.\nIf we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue growth may decline.\nAll of Vintage Stock\u2019s and ApplianceSmart\u2019s retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or we may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Our revenues and earnings may decline if we fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites, or find additional sites for new store expansion.\nAn adverse trend in sales during the winter and holiday selling season could impact our financial results.\nOur retail business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a major portion of Vintage Stock\u2019s and ApplianceSmart\u2019s sales realized around various holidays and other days, including Black Friday, President\u2019s Day, tax refund season, Memorial Day, July 4th and Labor Day. Any adverse trend in sales during these times could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing and allocations of new product releases;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new store openings or closings;\n\u2022\nshifts in the timing or content or certain promotions or service offerings;\n\u2022\nthe effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we are operating;\n\u2022\nacquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets or stores.\nThese and other factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts.\nFailure to effectively manage our new store openings could lower our sales and profitability.\nOur growth strategy depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. Our ability to open new stores and operate them profitability depends upon a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include the ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify new store locations, negotiate suitable leases and build out the stores in a timely and cost-efficient manner;\n\u2022\nhire and train skilled associates;\n\u2022\nintegrate new stores into our existing operations; and\n\u2022\nincrease sales at new store locations.\nIf we fail to manage new store openings in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our growth or profits may decrease.\nIf our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted.\nWe rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our stores and distribution centers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new products and deliver them to all of our stores, enables us to meet peak demand\nand replenish stores to keep our stores in stock at optimum levels and to move inventory efficiently. If our inventory or management information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted for a prolonged period of time of if these centers were unable to accommodate the continued store growth in a particular region, our business would suffer.\nWe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have previously recorded significant goodwill as a result of our acquisition of Vintage Stock. Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facilities, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOur financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our floating rate credit facilities are subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we were to borrow against our float rate credit facilities, a significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FLOORING MANUFACTURING SEGMENT\nThe floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s flooring manufacturing business.\nDownturns in the U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, negatively impact the floor covering industry and our flooring manufacturing business. Although the difficult economic conditions have improved in the U.S., there may be additional downturns that could cause the industry to deteriorate in the foreseeable future. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments.\nWe operate in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and technical features. Failure to quickly and effectively respond to changing customer demand or technological developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for our products or force us to lower prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe floor covering industry is highly competitive. We face competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors, many of whom have more resources than us. Maintaining our competitive position may require substantial investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network\nand sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products or force us to lower prices. Moreover, a strong U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel costs may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with our products, which may put pressure on our pricing. The occurrence of one or more of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn periods of rising costs, we may be unable to pass raw materials, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. Although we generally attempt to pass on increases in raw material, energy and fuel-related costs to our customers, our ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for our products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the occurrence of such events may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STEEL MANUFACTURING SEGMENT\nThe demand of our products may decrease if manufacturing in North America declines or if automakers who manufacture their products in the U.S. do not introduce new models.\nThe products manufactured by Precision Marshall typically follow the North American (primarily the U.S.) manufacturing cycle, with a large emphasis on automotive manufacturing. If North American (primarily the U.S.) manufacturing is transferred to offshore countries, then the need of our products to make tools and dies will decrease, which will have a negative impact on our business, financial condition (including, without limitation, our liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we rely heavily on the sale of our products to automakers who purchase our products when they retool production lines in connection with the introduction of new models. If those automakers do not introduce a new model in any given year, our sales may decrease which will have a negative impact on our business, financial condition (including, without limitation, our liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows.\nLimited availability, or volatility in prices of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins.\nPrecision Marshall and other steel producers have periodically faced problems obtaining sufficient raw materials in a timely manner, and sometimes at all, due to a limited number of suppliers, delays, defaults, severe weather conditions, force majeure events (including public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic), shortages, or transportation problems (such as shortages of barges, vessels, rail cars or trucks, or disruption of rail lines, waterways, or natural gas transmission lines), resulting in production curtailments. As a result, we may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials from third parties as well as supply and logistics constraints moving our own raw materials to our plants. In addition, if the already limited number of suppliers consolidate, it would limit our negotiating power for raw material purchases.\nPrecision Marshall has in the past, and may in the future continue to, purchase raw materials from sources even when they are above market cost. Additionally, any future decreases in iron ore, scrap, natural gas and oil prices may place downward pressure on steel prices. If steel prices decline, our profit margins on indexed contracts and spot business could be reduced.\nShortages of qualified and trainable labor, increased labor costs, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe depend on skilled or trainable drug free labor for the manufacture of our products. Our continued success depends on the active participation of our key employees. Precision Marshall, like other companies that reply on a trained blue-collar workforce receives pressure from other manufactures regarding the labor pool. Precision Marshall, aside from competing with other manufacturers, also competes with non-industrial blue-collar professions\nfor labor. Should a significant employer move into our geographical area, such employer could draw from the current labor pool and require a substantial increase in training expense.\nOur operational footprint, unplanned equipment outages, and other unforeseen disruptions may adversely impact our results of operations.\nPrecision Marshall has adjusted its business model over time to fully utilize its equipment and manufacturing facility. Our production depends on running at a moderate rate of capacity. Outages due to power outages, weather, pandemics (including the Covid-19 pandemic), or machine outages effect Precision\u2019s capability to produce at the level necessary to meet customer demand or at all.\nIt is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as union and other foreign tariffs, free trade agreements, trade regulations, laws, and policies. We are also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future. Availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions, such as shortages of barges, ocean vessels, rail cars or trucks, or unavailability of rail lines or of the locks on the Great Lakes or other bodies of water. To the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage, our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected.\nOur production and distribution workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nOur manufacturing employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the United Steel Workers and our warehouse and distribution workforce employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the International Aeronautical and Machinists Union. These agreements are scheduled to expire in December 2020 and April 2021, respectively. Future negotiations prior to the expiration of our collective agreements may result in labor unrest for which a strike or work stoppage is possible. Strikes and/or work stoppages could negatively affect our operational and financial results and may increase operating expenses.\nWe rely on third parties for transportation services, and increases in costs or the availability of transportation may adversely affect our business and operations\nOur business depends on the transportation of a large number of products. We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of our products as well as delivery of our raw materials. Any increase in the cost of the transportation of our raw materials or products, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, consolidation in the transportation industry, or otherwise, may adversely affect our results of operations as we may not be able to pass such cost increases on to our customers.\nIf any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture and deliver our products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost or at any cost as there is a limited number of suppliers worldwide for our raw material.\nIn addition, such failure of a third-party transportation provider could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe face risks relating to changes in U.S. and foreign tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and policies\nOur business depends on manufacturing products in North America. If tariffs rise unproportionally on raw materials compared to finished tools, we are at risk for manufacturers to purchase the products that we sell from third parties who are not subject to such tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and/or policies.\nThe steel industry is highly cyclical, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSteel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets. This volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with global steel prices, our steel production and customer product demand. Precision Marshall has implemented strategic initiatives to produce more viable results during periods of economic and market downturns, but this may not be enough to mitigate the effect that the volatility inherent in the steel industry has on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, our business is reliant on certain other industries that are cyclical in nature. We sell to the distributors who in turn sell to the automotive, appliance defense and construction-related industries. Some of these industries exhibit a great deal of sensitivity to general economic conditions and may also face meaningful fluctuations in demand based on a number of factors outside of our control, including regulatory factors, economic conditions, and raw material and energy costs. As a result, downturns, or volatility in any of the markets we serve could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risks, which may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\nThe purchases raw material and certain necessary equipment are transactions often take place with foreign countries. The weakening of the of the U.S. dollar against the euro negatively affects our price for which we pay for raw material and equipment. Volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition.\nCompliance with existing and new environmental regulations, environmental permitting and approval requirements may result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nSteel producers in the U.S., along with their customers and suppliers, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations concern the generation, storage, transportation, disposal, emission or discharge of pollutants, contaminants and hazardous substances into the environment, the reporting of such matters, and the general protection of public health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. Steel producers in the EU are subject to similar laws. These laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Additionally, compliance with certain state and local requirements, could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs. Compliance with current or future regulations could entail additional costs for additional systems and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with the requirements may result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, revocation of permits to conduct business or construct certain facilities, substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.\nIn addition, Precision Marshall outsources all disposal of waste material, non-compliance by third party providers could result in additional costs to defend environmental claims or additional costs to replace the outsourced entities.\nThere can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses and permits we currently hold. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, compliance with the environmental permitting and approval requirements may be costly and time consuming and could result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from steelmaking operations to comply with EU regulations as well as societal expectations could increase costs to manufacture future raw materials or reduce the amount of materials being manufactured.\nPrecision Marshall relies on raw material sources in the EU and USA. Tightening of those requirements in the EU and/or sources in the USA could deter steel produces from producing the raw material for our products or result in significant price increases of our raw material.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nDue to our concentrated stock ownership, public stockholders may have no effective voice in our management and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Isaac Capital Group LLC (\u201cICG\u201d), together with Jon Isaac, our President and CEO and the President and sole member of ICG, control approximately 46.2% of the outstanding voting power of our company (assuming the exercise of all outstanding and exercisable warrants held by them). Jon Isaac has the sole power to vote the shares of our common stock owned by ICG. As a result, Jon Isaac, both individually and through ICG, is able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain shareholder approval, including the election of directors to our board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. Moreover, such a concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stock ownership.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your shares of common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion, and debt repayment and, with the exception of dividends payable on shares of our Series E Preferred Stock, we have no current plans to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on your investment would likely come only from an increase in the market value of our common stock. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nCertain provisions of Nevada law, in our organizational documents and in contracts to which we are party may prevent or delay a change of control of our company.\nWe are subject to the Nevada anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent Nevada corporations from engaging in a merger, consolidation, sales of its stock or assets, and certain other transactions with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock, except in certain situations. In addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, and privileges of these shares, without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nstockholders must comply with advance notice requirements to transact any business at the annual meeting;\n\u2022\nall stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by written consent, unless such action or proposal is first approved by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nspecial meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the President of our company;\n\u2022\na director may be removed from office only for cause by the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power entitled to vote at an election of directors;\n\u2022\nour Board of Directors is expressly authorized to alter, amend or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nnewly-created directorships and vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of remaining directors, and not by our stockholders; and\n\u2022\ncumulative voting is not allowed in the election of our directors.\nThese provisions of Nevada law and our articles and bylaws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control of our company and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 92557, "SIC": 5700, "TIC": "LIVE"}
