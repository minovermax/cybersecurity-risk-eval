{"cik": "740260", "company": "Ventas, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section discusses material factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. It does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline.\nAs set forth below, we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories:\n\u2022COVID-19 Risks\n\u2022Our Business Operations and Strategy Risks\n\u2022Environmental, Economic and Market Risks\n\u2022Our Capital Structure Risks\n\u2022Our Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\n\u2022Our REIT Status Risks\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread have materially negatively impacted our businesses in a number of ways and is expected to continue to do so. For instance, operating costs at our senior housing communities have increased as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other operational and regulatory changes affecting our properties and our operations, while occupancy and revenue have decreased. Certain of our tenants and managers have incurred significant costs or losses as a result of the pandemic, and may continue to do so, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAlthough we continue to undertake extensive efforts to ensure the safety of our properties, employees and residents and to provide operator support in this regard, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our facilities could result in additional operational costs. The effects of shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, including remote work arrangements for an extended period of time, could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business. Further, we have and may continue to implement mitigation and other measures to support and protect our employees, which could result in increased labor costs.\nSenior housing facilities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has, to varying degrees during the course of the pandemic, prevented prospective occupants and their families from visiting our senior housing communities and limited the ability of new occupants to move into our senior housing communities due to heightened move-in criteria and screening. Although the ongoing impact of the pandemic and vaccine deployment on occupancy remain uncertain, occupancy of our senior housing and triple-net properties could further decrease, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect demand for senior housing for an extended period. Such a decrease could affect the net operating income of our senior housing properties and the ability of our triple-net tenants to make contractual payments to us, which in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition, including our ability to pay dividend distributions at expected levels or at all.\nAdditionally, across our property types, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a heightened risk of tenant, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency due to factors such as decreased occupancy, medical practice disruptions resulting from stay-at-home orders, increased health and safety and labor expenses or litigation resulting from developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the risks associated with such events elsewhere in these risk factors, various federal, state and local governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, laws regulations and moratoriums or take other actions that could limit our ability to evict tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many of these moratoriums are expected to be temporary in nature, they may be in place for a significant period of time until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. While we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease or evict a tenant for nonpayment, such laws, regulations and moratoriums will generally prohibit our ability to begin eviction proceedings even where no rent or only partial rent is being paid for so long as such law, regulation or moratorium remains in effect. We may incur significant costs and it may take a significant amount of time to ultimately evict any tenant who is not meeting its contractual rent obligations. If we cannot transition a leased property to a\nnew tenant due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and reactions to it have also adversely affected the U.S. economy and global financial markets and, in the longer term, could result in a global economic downturn and a recession, or inflation, which may, in turn negatively impact our results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased, and may continue to increase, the magnitude of many of the other risks described herein.\nThe trajectory and future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains highly uncertain. The extent of the pandemic\u2019s continuing and ultimate effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the speed at which available vaccines can be successfully deployed; the rate of acceptance of available vaccines, particularly among the residents and staff in our senior housing communities; the impact of new variants of the virus and the effectiveness of available vaccines against those variants; ongoing clinical experience, which may differ considerably across regions and fluctuate over time; and on other future developments, including the ultimate duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, the availability of testing, the extent to which governments impose, rollback or re-impose preventative restrictions and the availability of ongoing government financial support to our business, tenants and operators. Due to these uncertainties, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThere is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and other pandemic-related legislation and any future COVID-19 relief measures. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial assistance we or our tenants or borrowers will receive or that we will be able to benefit from provisions intended to increase access to resources and ease regulatory burdens for healthcare providers.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act, and the CAA authorize a total of $178 billion to be distributed to healthcare providers through the Provider Relief Fund, which is administered by HHS. These grants are intended to reimburse eligible providers for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Recipients are not required to repay distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including reporting requirements, limitations on balance billing, and not using grants received from the Provider Relief Fund to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are obligated to reimburse maintaining records, and cooperating with any government audits.\nHHS began distributing Provider Relief Fund grants in April 2020 and has made grants available to various provider groups in phases. We applied for grants under Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Provider Relief Fund on behalf of the assisted living communities in our senior living operations segment and may apply for additional grants in the future. While we have received all amounts under our Phase 2 applications, and have begun to receive amounts under our Phase 3 applications, there can be no assurance that all our remaining applications will be approved or that additional grants will ultimately be received in full or in part. Any grants that are ultimately received and retained by us are not expected to fully offset the losses incurred in our senior living operating portfolio that are attributable to COVID-19. Further, although we continue to monitor and evaluate the terms and conditions associated with the Provider Relief Fund distributions, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all requirements related to the payments received under the Provider Relief Fund. If we or any of our tenants fail to comply with all of the terms and conditions, we or they may be required to repay some or all of the grants received and may be subject to other enforcement action, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe CARES Act and related legislation also make other forms of financial assistance available to healthcare providers, including through Medicare and Medicaid payment adjustments and an expansion of the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program, which makes available accelerated payments of Medicare funds in order to increase cash flow to providers in the form of loans that must be repaid. In addition to financial assistance, the CARES Act and related legislation include provisions intended to increase access to medical supplies and equipment and ease legal and regulatory burdens on healthcare providers. Many of these measures are effective only for the duration of the federal public health emergency that was declared as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current public health emergency determination expires April 21, 2021, and HHS has indicated that it likely will be extended but the duration of the extension is unclear. The HHS Secretary may choose to renew the declaration for successive 90-day periods for as long as the emergency continues to exist and may terminate the declaration whenever he determines that the public health emergency no longer exists.\nDue to the recent enactment of the CARES Act, and other enacted legislation, there is still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding their implementation. Further, the federal government is considering additional financial measures, federal agencies continue to issue related regulations and guidance, and the public health emergency continues to evolve. It is difficult to predict the extent to which anticipated ongoing negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on us and our tenants and\nborrowers will be offset by benefits which we may recognize or receive in the future under existing or future financial measures. Further, there can be no assurance that the terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Fund grants or other programs will not change or be interpreted in ways that affect our ability to comply with such terms and conditions (which could affect our ability to retain any grants that we receive), the amount of total financial grants we may ultimately receive or our eligibility to participate in any future funding. We continue to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses to the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Business Operations and Strategy Risks\nMarket conditions, including, but not limited to, economic and financial market events or conditions and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets and public capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the capital markets and any disruption to the capital markets or our ability to access such markets could impair our ability to fulfill our dividend requirements, make payments to our security holders or otherwise finance our business operations. The markets in which we operate are affected by a number of factors that are largely beyond our control but may nevertheless have a significant negative impact on us. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world, including a general tightening of availability of credit (including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained), the state of the public capital markets, decreased liquidity in certain financial markets, increased interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, declining consumer confidence, the actual or perceived state of the real estate market, sustained high levels of unemployment or significant declines in stock markets, as well as concerns regarding pandemics, epidemics and the spread of contagious diseases, could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, including recessions, economic slowdowns, high unemployment and rising prices or the perception by consumers of weak or weakening economic conditions may reduce disposable income and impact consumer spending in healthcare or seniors housing, for example, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, increased inflation may have a pronounced negative impact on the interest expense we pay in connection with our outstanding indebtedness, in our general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents, or in the wages that our managers or tenants are obligated to pay. Conversely, deflation may result in a decline in general price levels, often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit. The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment, credit contraction and weakened consumer demand. Restricted lending practices may impact our ability to obtain financing for our properties, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nTo the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets, this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect (i) the value of our properties\u037e (ii) the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may be able to obtain\u037e (iii) our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance when due, any outstanding debt\u037e (iv) our ability to pay a dividend and (v) the ability of our tenants to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nThird parties must operate our non-Office assets, limiting our control and influence over operations and results.\nAlthough we often have certain general oversight approval rights (e.g., with respect to budgets, material contracts, etc.) and the right to review operational and financial reporting information with respect to a majority of our portfolio, our third-party managers and tenants are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the property. As a result, we have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of the properties in our portfolio and we depend on third parties to operate these properties in a manner that complies with applicable law, minimizes legal risk and maximizes the value of our investment. The failure by such third parties to operate these properties efficiently and effectively and adequately manage the related risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating assets may expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite our limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of the properties in our senior living operations segment, as the owner and operator of senior housing operating properties, we are ultimately responsible for all operational risks and other liabilities of such properties, other than those arising out of certain actions by our managers, such as gross negligence or willful misconduct. These risks include, and our resulting revenues are impacted by, among other things, fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, rent control\nregulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, changes in management or equity, accounting misstatements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of insurance. Any one or a combination of these factors could result in deficiencies in our senior living operations segment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such operational risks could also arise as a result of our ownership of office buildings, and which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, we generally hold the applicable healthcare license and enroll in applicable government healthcare programs on behalf of the properties in our senior living operations segment. This subjects us to potential liability under various healthcare laws and regulations. Healthcare laws and regulations are wide-ranging, and noncompliance may result in the imposition of civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including: the loss or suspension of accreditation, licenses or CONs; suspension of or non-payment for new admissions; denial of reimbursement; fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs; or facility closure.\nDecreases in our tenants\u2019, borrowers\u2019 or managers\u2019 revenues, or increases in their expenses, could affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited control over the success or failure of our tenants\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and managers\u2019 businesses, regardless of whether our relationship is structured as a triple-net lease, a management contract or as a lender to our tenants. While we do not expressly take on liability on the properties in our triple-net leased or office operations segments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result of the risks outlined below. Any of our tenants, borrowers or managers may experience a downturn in their business that materially weakens their financial condition. For example, many of our tenants, borrowers and managers have experienced significant downturns in their businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of interruptions in their operations, lost revenues, increased costs, financing difficulties and labor shortages. As a result, they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due. Although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict a tenant or terminate our management agreements, or demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or other obligations to us, we may not be able to enforce such rights or we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.\nOur senior housing tenants and managers primarily depend on private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members to pay fees. Costs associated with independent and assisted living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Accordingly, our tenants and managers of our senior housing business depend on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets, which may be affected by many factors, including: (i) prevailing economic and market trends, including the ongoing economic downturn and high unemployment rates; (ii) consumer confidence; (iii) demographics; (iv) property condition and safety, including as a result of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness, such as seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic; (v) public perception about such properties; and (vi) social and environmental factors. Consequently, if our tenants or managers on our behalf fail to effectively conduct their operations, or to maintain and improve our properties, it could adversely affect our business reputation as the owner of the properties, as well as the business reputation of our tenants or managers and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our and our tenant\u2019s or manager\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if widespread default or nonpayment of outstanding obligations from a large number of tenants or managers occurs at a time when terminating such agreement or replacing such tenants or managers may be extremely difficult or impossible, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may elect instead to amend such agreements with such tenants or managers. However, such amendment may be on terms that are less favorable to us than the original agreement and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur senior housing tenants and managers may also rely on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of the revenues from certain properties. Changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation, that may result from actions by Congress or executive orders, may result in reductions in our tenants\u2019 or managers\u2019 revenues, operations and cash flows and affect our tenants\u2019 or managers\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us. In addition, failure to comply with reimbursement regulations or other laws applicable to healthcare providers could result in penalties, fines, litigation costs, lost revenue or other consequences, which could adversely impact our tenants\u2019 ability to make contractual rent payments to us under a triple-net lease or our cash flows from operations under a management arrangement.\nOur tenants and managers have, and may continue to seek to, offset losses by obtaining funds under the recently adopted CARES Act or other similar legislative initiatives at the state and local level. It is indeterminable when or if these\ngovernment funds will ultimately be received by our tenants and managers or whether these funds may materially offset the cash flow disruptions experienced by them. If they are unable to obtain these funds within a reasonable time period or at all, or the conditions precedent to receiving these funds are overly burdensome or not feasible, it may substantially affect their ability to make payments or perform their obligations when due to us.\nA significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of tenants and managers, including Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent, Kindred, Atria and Sunrise.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Atria and Sunrise, collectively, managed 258 of our consolidated senior housing communities pursuant to long-term management agreements. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, our three largest tenants, Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred leased from us 121 properties, 12 properties and 32 properties respectively. These properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio, based on their gross book value, and account for a significant portion of our revenues and NOI.\nWe depend on Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures, and to comply with the terms of the mortgage financing documents, if any, affecting the properties they lease from us. We cannot assure you that they will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any failure by any one of Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent or Kindred to conduct effectively its operations or to maintain and improve the properties it leases from us could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients or residents in such properties, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. We cannot assure you that they will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy those obligations.\nWe rely on a relatively small number of third-party managers, including Atria and Sunrise, to manage a significant number of the properties in our senior living operations segment and to set appropriate resident fees, provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in such managers\u2019 business and affairs or financial condition could impair their ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could adversely affect the financial performance of our properties and our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any one of our managers experience financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could result in, among other adverse events, impacts to its financial stability, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital, the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties, or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it, any one or a combination of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event that any of our tenants or managers merge with one another, our dependence on a small group of significant third parties would increase, as would our exposure to the risks described above.\nIf we need to replace any of our tenants or managers, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur tenants may not renew their leases with us, and our managers may not renew their management agreements with us, beyond their current terms. Our leases and management agreements also provide us, our tenants and our managers with termination rights in certain circumstances. If our leases or management agreements are not renewed or are otherwise terminated, we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or manager, as applicable. We may not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases, management agreements or other arrangements with new tenants or managers on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases or management agreements, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned.\nDuring transition periods to new tenants or managers, the attention of existing tenants or operators may be diverted from the performance of the properties, which could cause the financial and operational performance at those properties to decline. Our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or manager could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, certificates of need (\u201cCON\u201d) or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid\nchange-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings.\nIn the case of our leased properties, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant. This risk could be exacerbated by new laws and regulations enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic that limit our ability to take remedial action against defaulted tenants. Further, our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge, we may lose potential tenants, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain tenants when leases expire. Our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants also could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the properties, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses.\nIn the event of borrower defaults, we may be unable to foreclose successfully on the collateral securing our loans and other investments, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to sell successfully any acquired equity interests or reposition any acquired properties, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.\nIf a borrower defaults under mortgage or other loans for which we are the lender, we may attempt to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. In response, the defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies, or bring claims against us for lender liability. Any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans and other investments, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our loans, and we could be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses. Moreover, the collateral may include equity interests that may have incurred unexpected liabilities or other limiting characteristics that may result in us not having full recourse to assets within that entity\u2019s subsidiary structure. For example, our mezzanine loan investments are subordinate to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate, and, in certain circumstances, affords them the ability to extinguish our rights in the collateral, subject to our rights under market and customary co-lender contractual arrangements. In addition, we may not be able to sell the acquired assets or equity interests due to securities law restrictions or otherwise. We may be unable to reposition the properties with new tenants, borrowers or managers on a timely basis, if at all, or without making improvements or repairs. Any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees. Failure to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge, an ineffective culture or lack of certain skill sets, significantly impacting our future performance and adversely affecting our business. Competition for talented employees is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. COVID-19 could also negatively affect the health, availability and productivity of our current personnel and could impact our ability to recruit and attract new employees and retain current employees, particularly as remote work arrangements and their impact on the market for talent remains uncertain. In addition, while we have long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior executives, if our retention and succession plans are not effective, or if we lose any one or more of our key officers and employees, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur investments are concentrated across a variety of assets classes within healthcare real estate, making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in those asset classes and the real estate industry generally.\nWe invest in a variety of assets classes in healthcare real estate, including senior housing, R&I and healthcare properties. While we endeavor to invest in a diversified portfolio, there can be no assurance that in a particular economic or operational environment that all assets will perform equally well or that our balance sheet will be appropriately balanced. Each of our asset classes are subject to their own dynamics and their own specific operational, financial, compliance, regulatory and market risks.\nAdditionally, a broad downturn or slowdown in the healthcare real estate sector could have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries and could negatively impact the ability of our tenants, borrowers and managers to meet their obligations to us. A downturn or slowdown in any one of our asset classes could adversely affect the value of our properties in such asset class and our ability to sell such properties at prices or on terms acceptable or favorable to us.\nIn addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating our investments in real estate. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. In the event we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry. In addition, transfers of healthcare real estate may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial real estate. We cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell for liquidity or other reasons, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in and acquisitions of properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. Investments in and acquisitions of healthcare real estate entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that a tenant, borrower or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. Investments outside the United States raise legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations, costly regulatory requirements and foreign tax risks. Domestic and international real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. Furthermore, healthcare real estate properties are often highly customized, and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities. Our significant acquisition and investment activity presents certain risks to our business and operations, including, among other things, that:\n\u2022We may be unable to integrate successfully the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame, or at all;\n\u2022We may be unable to monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties effectively, retain key employees or attract highly qualified new employees;\n\u2022Projections of estimated future revenues, costs savings or operating metrics that we develop during the due diligence and integration planning process might be inaccurate;\n\u2022Our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022Acquisitions and other new investments could divert management\u2019s attention from our existing assets; or\n\u2022The value of acquired assets or the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe cannot assure you that our acquisitions, developments, redevelopments and other investments will be successful or meet our expectations without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon identifying and consummating future investments and effectively managing our expansion opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to expand and diversify our portfolio, directly or indirectly with third parties, through accretive acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activities in domestic and international healthcare real estate. Our execution of this strategy by successfully identifying, securing and consummating beneficial transactions is made more challenging by increased competition and can be affected by many factors, including our\nrelationships with current and prospective clients and partners, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors and lower than the yield we earn on our acquisitions or investments, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with property owners seeking to sell and other contractual counterparties. We compete for these opportunities with a broad variety of potential investors, including other healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. See \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. If we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities and otherwise expanding and diversifying our portfolio, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected.\nFor example, we recently expanded into R&I and life sciences. When expanding into areas that are new to us, we face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with (i) the required investment of capital and other resources; (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk; (iii) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our other businesses; (iv) the increasing demands on or issues related to operational and management systems and controls; (v) compliance with additional legal or regulatory requirements with which we are not familiar; and (vi) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that any new strategies, markets or businesses that we enter into will be successful or meet our expectations without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in co-investment vehicles, joint ventures and minority interests may subject us to risks and liabilities that we would not otherwise face.\nWe have and may continue to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. In 2020, we formed the Ventas Investment Management Platform to consolidate our private capital management capabilities, which includes our Ventas Life Science and Healthcare Real Estate Fund, L.P. (the \u201cVentas Fund\u201d), our joint venture with GIC and other partnerships with institutional capital vehicles, under a single platform. As of December 31, 2020, we had over $3 billion in assets under management in this platform. In the future, we may enter into additional co-investments, partnerships and joint ventures, either through the Ventas Investment Management Platform or otherwise. We also own minority investments in properties and unconsolidated operating entities which entitle us to rights and protections typical of minority investments, but that inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co-investment vehicles or attract third-party investment through additional investments or otherwise. Further, there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from such investments.\nThese ventures involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following:\n\u2022We may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions;\n\u2022For ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our partners may take actions that we oppose;\n\u2022If our partners become bankrupt or otherwise fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, we may choose to or be required to contribute such capital;\n\u2022We may be subject to transfer restrictions that apply to our interest in the venture;\n\u2022Our partners may have business interests or goals that conflict with our business interests and goals, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments, and what levels of debt to incur or carry;\n\u2022Our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest;\n\u2022We could experience an impasse on certain decisions where we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes;\n\u2022Disagreements with our partners could result in litigation or arbitration;\n\u2022Our partners might become insolvent, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and\n\u2022We may suffer other losses as a result of actions taken by our partners with respect to our venture investments.\nIn some instances, our partners may have the right to cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner\u2019s interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner\u2019s interest will be limited\nif we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. This would require us to sell our interest in the venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it.\nAdditionally, certain ventures require Ventas to assume the role of managing member with increased duties to the partnership. In the event of certain events or conflicts, our partners may have recourse against Ventas, including monetary penalties, the ability to force a sale or exit the venture, as well as other remedies.\nDevelopment, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability.\nWe invest in various development and redevelopment projects. In deciding whether to make an investment in a project, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the property. Our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that:\n\u2022Tenants may not lease space at the quantity or rental rate levels or on the schedule projected, including due to increased competition in the market and other market and economic conditions;\n\u2022We may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts;\n\u2022We may not be able to recognize rental revenue in some cases although cash rent is being paid and the lease has commenced;\n\u2022We may encounter delays in obtaining or we may fail to obtain all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations, or underestimate the costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property to market standards;\n\u2022We may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all, including at the maturity of an applicable construction loan;\n\u2022Construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs, including through rent abatement;\n\u2022Volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs;\n\u2022In the case of our MOB and R&I developments, hospitals, health systems, or university partners may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the development schedule;\n\u2022Our builders or development managers may fail to perform or satisfy the expectations of our clients or prospective clients; and\n\u2022We may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions, including new markets where we may not have sufficient depth of market knowledge.\nIf any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, borrowers, managers and other obligors.\nWe lease our properties to unaffiliated tenants or operate them through independent third-party managers. We are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and managers. We have limited control over the success or failure of our tenants\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and managers\u2019 businesses, and, at any time, a tenant, borrower or manager may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition. If that happens, the tenant, borrower or manager may fail to make its payments to us when due. Although our lease, loan and management agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may decide not to exercise those remedies if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches. We may also decide not to enforce other contractual protections, such as annual rent escalators, or the properties may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This risk could be exacerbated by new laws and regulations enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic that limit our ability to enforce contractual escalators against tenants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA downturn in any one of our tenants\u2019, borrowers\u2019 or managers\u2019 businesses could ultimately lead to its bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes, which may be largely outside of its control. Bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of our rights and remedies unenforceable, or, at the least, delay our ability to pursue such rights and remedies and realize any recoveries in connection therewith. For example, we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy filing. Additionally, a debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. We also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant or manager.\nBankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may result in increased costs and significant management distraction. If we are unable to transition affected properties efficiently and effectively, such properties could experience prolonged operational disruption, leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues. Publicity about a tenant\u2019s, borrowers\u2019 or manager\u2019s financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, which could result in decreased customer demand and revenues. Any or all of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single third party under a master lease, as a failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties.\nWe own certain properties subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated.\nOur investments in MOBs, R&I buildings and facilities as well as other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. Many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties\u2019 value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. In addition, we could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us or terminated.\nEnvironmental, Economic and Market Risks\nIncreased construction and development in the markets in which our properties are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability.\nThe oversupply of healthcare real estate could adversely affect our business. In many jurisdictions, limited barriers to entry could lead to the development of new properties that outpaces demand across our various asset classes. If existing supply and development collectively outpaces demand for those assets in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results.\nWe are exposed to general economic conditions, local, regional, national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties. Our operating performance is impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties and could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any such markets. For example, a shortage of skilled workers in a particular region, including nurses or other trained personnel, may force our third-party managers to enhance their pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel, but such managers may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents, which may result in less revenue to our business.\nA substantial portion of our value is derived from properties in California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania and Illinois, and as a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, changing demographics, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events and changes in state-specific legislation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that we or our tenants, borrowers and managers are unable to navigate successfully the trends impacting our or their businesses and the industries in which we or they operate, we may be adversely affected.\nOur tenants, borrowers and managers include senior housing operators, hospitals, post-acute facilities and other healthcare systems, medical offices and life sciences and technology companies that are subject to a complex set of trends affecting their businesses and the industries in which they operate. If we or they are unable to successfully navigate such trends, our business, financial condition and results of operators could be adversely affected.\nThere have been, and could be additional, advances or changes in technology, payment models, healthcare delivery models, regulation or consumer behavior or perception that could over time reduce demand for on-site activities provided at our properties. For example, the effects of shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, including remote work arrangements for an extended period of time, could broadly impact market demand for real estate and could cause long term structural changes in the marketplace. If our tenants and managers are not able to adapt to long-term changes in demand, their financial condition could be materially impacted, and our business could suffer. In addition, our tenants, borrowers and managers face an increasingly competitive labor market, which has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. An inability to attract and retain trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants, borrowers and managers to meet their obligations to us. A shortage of care givers or other trained personnel, union activities, minimum wage laws, or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants, borrowers and managers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel, or to use more expensive contract personnel, but they may be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents.\nAdditionally, controls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as \u201cutilization reviews,\u201d have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our tenants, specifically acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. Telehealth and increased use of home healthcare may also reduce demand for activities at our properties. The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement. Several of these laws, including the Affordable Care Act, have promoted shifting from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models to alternative payment models that tie reimbursement to quality and cost of care, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments. See \u201cGovernment Regulation-United States Healthcare Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. These and other trends could significantly and adversely affect the profitability of these tenants, which could affect their ability to make rental payments to us or their willingness to renew their leases on terms that are as favorable to us, or at all.\nThe hospitals on or near the campuses where our MOBs are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our MOBs and our other properties that serve the healthcare industry.\nOur MOBs and other properties that serve the healthcare industry depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near the campuses where our properties are located and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our properties. The viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. If a hospital on or near the campus where one of our properties is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, that hospital may be unable to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate, which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients. Because we rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our properties, a hospital\u2019s inability to remain competitive or financially viable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could adversely affect our properties and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur life science, R&I tenants face unique levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty.\nOur life science, R&I tenants develop and sell products and services in an industry that is characterized by rapid and significant changes, evolving industry standards and uncertainty over the implementation of new healthcare reform legislation, which may cause them to lose competitive positions and adversely affect their operation. These tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, require significant outlays of funds for the research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and commercialization of their products and technologies, as well as to fund their obligations, including rent payments due to us, and our tenants\u2019 ability to raise capital depends on the viability of their products and technologies, their financial and operating condition and outlook, and the overall financial, banking and economic environment. If private investors, the federal government, universities, public markets or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such development, including as a result of general economic conditions, adverse market conditions or government shutdowns that limit our tenants\u2019 ability to raise capital, such as those resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, a tenant may not be able to pay rent on the terms agreed or at all, its business may fail and in certain cases, its lease may automatically terminate without any further obligation to pay us rent.\nAdditionally, the research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants\u2019 products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals. The approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. Even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may fail to obtain the\nrequired regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, our tenants may only have a small number of products under development. If one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly adversely affect such tenant\u2019s entire business and its ability to pay rent. Our tenants depend on the commercial success of certain products, and they may be unable to manufacture their products successfully or economically; may be unable to adapt to the rapid technological advances in the industry and to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws or may face expiration of patent protection; may be faced with later discovery of safety concerns; may face competition from new products; or may not receive acceptance of their products.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our life science, R&I tenants will be successful in their businesses. Any tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above may have difficulty making rental payments or satisfying its other lease obligations to us or may have difficulty maintaining the value of our investment, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMerger, acquisition and investment activity in our industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor\u2019s investment in, one or more of our tenants, borrowers or managers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe seniors housing and healthcare industries have experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, including among owners of real estate, tenants and care providers. In connection with any change of control of a tenant, borrower or manager, such tenant\u2019s, borrower\u2019s or manager\u2019s strategy, financial condition, management team or real estate needs may change, any of which could adversely affect our relationship with such party and our revenues and results of operations. In addition, a competitor\u2019s investment in one of our tenants, borrowers or managers could enable our competitor to directly or indirectly influence that tenant\u2019s, borrower\u2019s or manager\u2019s business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the tenant, borrower or manager or is otherwise adverse to our interests. Depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may not have the right to consent to a competitor\u2019s investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a tenant, borrower or manager.\nDamage from catastrophic or extreme weather and other natural events and the physical effects of climate change could result in losses to the Company.\nCertain of our properties are in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by catastrophic or extreme weather and other natural events, including fires, snow or ice storms, windstorms or hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding or other severe weather. These adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our or our tenants\u2019, borrowers\u2019 or managers\u2019 property insurance coverage. Operationally, such events could cause a major power outage, leading to a disruption of our systems and operations. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future revenue from that property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable.\nTo the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.\nOur Capital Structure Risks\nWe may become more leveraged.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $11.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness. The instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. A high level of indebtedness would require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to\nimplement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. A high level of indebtedness on an absolute basis or as a ratio to our cash flow could also have the following consequences:\n\u2022Potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries;\n\u2022Potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and\n\u2022Potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, from time to time, we mortgage certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. If we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value.\nWe are highly dependent on access to the capital markets. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on us, including our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy, if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs, and the failure to do so could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us.\nAs a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market\u2019s perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. Our failure to meet the market\u2019s expectation regarding future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide. We cannot assure you that conditions in the bank lending, capital and other financial markets will not continue to deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. The continuance of decreased revenue and NOI as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to downgrades of our long-term credit rating. Such future downgrades could increase our borrowing costs, which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. In addition, the deterioration of global economic conditions as a result of the pandemic has decreased occupancy levels and pricing across our portfolio as senior residents and tenants reduce or defer their spending.\nWe also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur ownership of properties in Canada and the United Kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars or the British pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. If we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, senior housing or healthcare assets outside the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. Although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local\ncurrencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are floating rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of LIBOR, Bankers\u2019 Acceptance or other indexes. The generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. Although our operating assets provide a partial hedge against interest rate fluctuations, if interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate debt and any new debt that we incur would increase. These increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. An increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nWe may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. Moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR may affect our financial results.\nLIBOR and certain other interest \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight U.S. treasury repo market, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish the SOFR in May 2018. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether the SOFR or another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets, and could have an adverse effect on LIBOR-based interest rates on our current or future debt obligations.\nCovenants in the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations.\nThe terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. Our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. In addition, covenants contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries\u2019 outstanding mortgage indebtedness may restrict our ability to obtain cash distributions from such subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations. Financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nSignificant legal or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants or managers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we or our tenants or managers may be subject to lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and managers. These claims may include, among other things, professional liability and general liability claims, commercial liability claims, unfair business practices claims and employment claims, as well as regulatory proceedings, including proceedings related to our senior living operations, where we are typically the holder of the applicable healthcare license.\nIn our operating assets, including those in our senior living operations and office segments, we are generally responsible for all liabilities of such properties, including any lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal or regulatory proceedings, other than those arising out of certain actions by our managers, such as those caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct. As a result, we have exposure to, among other things, professional and general liability claims, employment law claims and the associated litigation and other costs related to defending and resolving such claims. In our senior living operations in particular, if one of our managers fails to comply with applicable law or regulation, we may be deemed responsible, which could subject us to the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including: the loss or suspension of accreditation, licenses or CONs; suspension of or non-payment for new admissions; denial of reimbursement; fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs; or facility closure.\nIn certain circumstances, our tenants or managers may be contractually obligated to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless in whole or in part with respect to certain actions, legal or regulatory proceedings. In addition, third parties from whom we acquired certain of our assets and, in some cases, their affiliates may be required by the terms of the related conveyance documents to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless against certain actions, investigations and claims related to the acquired assets and arising prior to our ownership or related to excluded assets and liabilities. In some cases, a portion of the purchase price consideration is held in escrow for a specified period of time as collateral for these indemnification obligations. We cannot assure you that these third parties will be able to satisfy their defense and indemnification obligations to us or that any purchase price consideration held in escrow will be sufficient to satisfy claims for which we are entitled to indemnification.\nAn unfavorable resolution of any such lawsuit, investigation, claims or other legal or regulatory proceeding could materially adversely affect our or our tenants\u2019 or managers\u2019 liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and may not be subject to sufficient insurance coverage. In addition, even with a favorable resolution of any such litigation or proceeding, the effect of litigation and other potential litigation and proceedings may materially increase operating costs incurred by us or our tenants or managers. Negative publicity with respect to any lawsuits, claims or other legal or regulatory proceedings may also negatively impact their or our or the properties\u2019 reputation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may cause our senior housing and healthcare business to face increased exposure to lawsuits or other legal or regulatory proceedings filed at the same time across multiple jurisdictions, such as professional or general liability litigation alleging wrongful death and negligence claims, some of which may result in large damage awards and not be indemnified or subject to sufficient insurance coverage, may require our support as a result of our indemnification agreements or may result in restrictions in the operations of our or our tenants\u2019 or managers\u2019 business.\nWe and our tenants, borrowers and managers may be adversely affected by regulation and enforcement.\nWe and our tenants, borrowers and managers are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. For example, the healthcare industry is subject to laws and regulations that relate to, among other things, licensure and CON, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, construction of new facilities and addition of equipment, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, appropriateness and classification of care, patient rights, resident health and safety, data privacy and security laws, wage and hour laws, fraud and abuse and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. We generally hold the applicable healthcare licenses and enroll in applicable government healthcare programs on behalf of the properties in our senior living operations segment, which subjects us to potential liability under certain of such related healthcare laws and regulations. See \u201cGovernment Regulation-United States Healthcare Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. In addition, many of our R&I tenants\nare subject to laws and regulations that govern the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of drugs, medical devices and similar products.\nThe laws and regulations that apply to us and our tenants, borrowers and managers are complex and may change rapidly, and efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources. Any changes in scope, interpretation or enforcement of the regulatory framework could require us or our tenants, borrowers or managers to invest significant resources responding to such changes. If we or our tenants, borrowers or managers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to our or their businesses and the operation of our or their properties, we or they could face a number of remedial actions, including forced closure, loss of accreditation, bans on admissions of new patients or residents, imposition of fines, ineligibility to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs or civil or criminal penalties. In any such event, our and our tenants\u2019, borrowers\u2019 and managers\u2019 respective businesses, results of operations (including results of properties) and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur investments may expose us to unknown liabilities.\nWe may acquire or invest in properties or businesses that are subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may assume or incur liabilities, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities, and be exposed to actual or potential claims in connection with our acquisitions that adversely affect us, such as:\n\u2022Liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of environmental conditions;\n\u2022Unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the sellers;\n\u2022Liabilities, claims and litigation, including indemnification obligations, whether incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition;\n\u2022Claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and\n\u2022Liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition.\nIf the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses of which we were not aware at the time of acquisition, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes.\nUnder federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with such property. Owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. In certain circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former operator of the property. Although we generally have indemnification rights against the current tenants of our properties for contamination caused by them, such indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. See \u201cGovernment Regulation-Environmental Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information or damage our business relationships and reputation.\nCybersecurity incidents and cyber-attacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level and will likely continue to increase in frequency in the future. As our reliance on technology has increased, our business is subject to greater risk from cyber incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our managers\u2019 or venture partners\u2019 systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, and other electronic security breaches. While we,\nour managers and our business partners have implemented measures to help mitigate these threats, such measures cannot guarantee that we or they will be successful in preventing a cyber incident. Our information technology networks and related systems are essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business and the occurrence of a cyber incident could result in a data center outage, disrupting our systems and operations, or the operations of our managers or business partners, compromise the confidential information of our employees, partners or the residents in our senior housing communities, and damage our business relationships and reputation. Although we have implemented various measures to manage risks relating to these types of events, such systems could prove to be inadequate and, if compromised, could become inoperable for extended periods of time, cease to function properly or fail to adequately secure private information. We do not control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by third-party providers, and such third-party providers may have limited indemnification obligations to us, which could cause us to be negatively impacted as a result. Breaches such as those involving covertly introduced malware, impersonation of authorized users and industrial or other espionage may not be identified even with sophisticated prevention and detection systems, potentially resulting in further harm and preventing them from being addressed appropriately. The failure of these systems or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information, material nonpublic information and intellectual property and trade secrets and other sensitive information in our possession. We could be required to make a significant investment to remedy the effects of any such failures, including but not limited to harm to our reputation, legal claims that we and our partners may be subjected to, regulatory or enforcement action arising out of applicable privacy and other laws, adverse publicity, or other events that may affect our business and financial performance.\nThe amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, managers or other counterparties may not adequately insure against losses.\nWe maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our tenants, managers or other counterparties maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in each industry. Although we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements, we cannot assure you that we or our tenants, managers or other counterparties, will be able to procure or maintain adequate levels of insurance. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost of insurance is expected to increase, and such insurance may not cover certain claims related to COVID-19. We also cannot assure you that we or our tenants, managers or other counterparties will maintain the insurance coverage required under our lease, management and other agreements, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or at all or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. Furthermore, we cannot make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, managers and other counterparties. If we sustain losses in excess of our insurance coverage, we may be required to pay the difference and we could lose our investment in, or experience reduced profits and cash flows from our operations.\nIn certain cases, we and our tenants and managers may be subject to professional liability, general liability, employment, premise, privacy, environmental, unfair business practice and contracts claims brought by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys seeking significant damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, some of which may not be insured or indemnified and some of which may result in significant damage awards. Due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against senior housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. In addition, insurance for other claims such as wage and hour, certain environmental, privacy and unfair business practices may no longer be available, and the premiums on such insurance coverage, to the extent it is available, remain costly. As a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants or managers and may not be available at a reasonable cost or otherwise on terms that provide adequate coverage. If we or our tenants and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities and the adverse impact on our or our tenants\u2019 and managers\u2019 respective financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material, and could adversely affect our tenants\u2019 and managers\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us.\nAdditionally, we and those of our tenants and managers who self-insure or who transfer risk of losses to a wholly owned captive insurance company could incur large funded and unfunded property and liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect theirs or our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nOur REIT Status Risks\nLoss of our status as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock.\nIf we lose our status as a REIT (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:\n\u2022We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax;\n\u2022We could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and\n\u2022Unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.\nIn addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain REIT status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, generally including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets, a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains. Although we believe that we currently qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods.\nThe 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions.\nTo comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders.\nFrom time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements. For example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement.\nIn the event that timing differences occur or we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. Any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see \u201c-Our Capital Structure Risks-We are highly dependent on access to the capital markets. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on us, including our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make\ndistributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy.\u201d The terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions.\nTo preserve our qualification as a REIT, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company.\nTo assist us in preserving our qualification as a REIT, our certificate of incorporation provides that if a person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 9.0% of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9% of our outstanding preferred stock, the shares that are beneficially owned in excess of the applicable limit are considered \u201cexcess shares\u201d and are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our Board of Directors. The trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. In addition, we have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares. If we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our Board of Directors. These ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur use of TRSs is limited under the Code.\nUnder the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs\u2019 operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. Also, our TRSs may not, among other things, operate or manage certain healthcare facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our TRSs that are not on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with our TRSs are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities (including investing in our tenants) or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make (including investments in our tenants) or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. This limited investment scope could also lead to financial risks or limit our flexibility during times of operating instability.\nThe lease of qualified healthcare properties to a TRS is subject to special requirements.\nWe lease certain healthcare properties to TRSs, which lessees contract with third-party managers to manage the healthcare operations at these properties. The rents we receive from a TRS pursuant to this arrangement are treated as qualifying rents from real property if the healthcare property is a qualified healthcare property (as defined in the Code), the rents are paid pursuant to an arm\u2019s-length lease with a TRS and the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). We have structured the applicable leases and related arrangements in a manner intended to meet these requirements, but there can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions is not satisfied with respect to a particular lease, then the rents we receive with respect to such lease will not be qualifying rents, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with REIT income tests and thus on our ability to qualify as a REIT unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions.\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes.\nA REIT\u2019s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless certain safe harbor exceptions apply. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us.\nThe rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. New legislation, U.S. Treasury Department regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders. The 2017 Tax Act is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.", "PERMNO": 75819, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "VTR"}
