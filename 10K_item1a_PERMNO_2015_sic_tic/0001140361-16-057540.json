{"cik": "1069996", "company": "FEDERATED NATIONAL HOLDING CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to certain risks in our business operations which are described below. Careful consideration of these risks should be made before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing FNHC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters.\nWe write insurance policies that cover homeowners, business owners and automobile owners for losses that result from, among other things, catastrophes and sinkholes. Catastrophic losses can be caused by natural events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, wind, hail, fires, explosions and other events, and their incidence and severity are inherently unpredictable. They can also be caused by terrorist attacks, war, riots, political instability and other man-made events. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of two factors: the total amount of the insurance company\u2019s exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Although our homeowners\u2019 policyholders are disbursed throughout Florida, substantially all of them are located in Florida, which is especially subject to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms, and a substantial portion are located in southeastern Florida.\nThe occurrence of claims from catastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year. Increases in the values and concentrations of insured property may also increase the severity of these occurrences in the future. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls and the purchase of third-party reinsurance, catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations. As a result, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough Florida has not experienced a hurricane during the last ten hurricane seasons, some weather analysts believe that we have entered a period of greater hurricane activity. We are exploring alternatives to reduce our exposure to these types of storms, which may increase operating expenses and may not be successful in protecting long-term profitability. If our loss experience is more adverse than is contemplated by our loss reserves, the related increase in our loss reserves may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs.\nAlthough we follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our risks, our costs of obtaining reinsurance fluctuates and we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements.\nWe have a reinsurance structure that is a combination of private reinsurance and the FHCF. Our reinsurance structure is composed of several reinsurance companies with varying levels of participation providing coverage for loss and LAE\u2019s at pre-established minimum and maximum amounts. Losses incurred in connection with a catastrophic event below the minimum and above the maximum are the responsibility of FNIC.\nThe availability and costs associated with the acquisition of reinsurance will vary year to year. We are not able to control these fluctuations which may be significant and may limit our ability to purchase adequate coverage. The recovery of increased reinsurance costs through rate action is not immediate and cannot be presumed, as it is subject to approval of the Florida OIR.\nWe face a risk of non-collectability of reinsurance, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs is common practice within the insurance industry, we transfer a portion of the risks insured under our policies to other companies through the purchase of reinsurance. This reinsurance is maintained to protect our insurance subsidiary against the severity of losses on individual claims, unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss and other catastrophic events. Although reinsurance does not discharge our insurance subsidiary from its primary obligation to pay for losses insured under the policies it issues, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiary for the reinsured portion of the risk. A credit exposure exists with respect to ceded losses to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts. The collectability of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reinsurance structure has significant risks, including the fact that the FHCF may not be able to raise sufficient money to pay their claims or impair their ability to pay their claims in a timely manner. This could result in significant financial, legal and operational challenges to our company. Therefore, in the event of a catastrophic loss, we may become dependent upon the FHCF\u2019s ability to pay, which may, in turn, be dependent upon the SBA\u2019s ability to issue bonds in amounts that would be required to meet its reinsurance obligations in the event of such a catastrophic loss.\nIf we are unable to continue our growth because our capital must be used to pay greater than anticipated claims, our financial results may suffer.\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to expand the types of insurance products we offer and the geographic markets in which we do business, both balanced by the business risks we choose to assume and cede. We believe that our Company is sufficiently capitalized to operate our business as it now exists and as we currently plan to expand it. Our existing sources of funds include possible sales of our investment securities and our earnings from operations and investments. Unexpected catastrophic events in our market areas, such as the hurricanes experienced in Florida, have resulted and may result in greater claims losses than anticipated, which could require us to limit or halt our growth while we redeploy our capital to pay these unanticipated claims.\nWe may require additional capital in the future which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. To the extent that our capital may be insufficient to meet future operating requirements and/or cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth. Many factors will affect the amount and timing of our capital needs, including our growth and profitability, our claims experience, and the availability of reinsurance, as well as possible acquisition opportunities, market disruptions and other unforeseeable developments.\nIf we were required to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders\u2019 ownership could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of existing shareholders. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business or pay dividends. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we conduct business. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to shareholders and other investors, and relates to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurance company\u2019s business. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. State regulatory authorities also conduct periodic examinations into insurers\u2019 business practices. These reviews may reveal deficiencies in our insurance operations or differences between our interpretations of regulatory requirements and those of the regulators.\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, and state insurance regulators are constantly reexamining existing laws and regulations, generally focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws.\nFrom time to time, some states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. In other situations, states in which we conduct business have considered or enacted laws that impact the competitive environment and marketplace for property and casualty insurance. In addition, in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. Changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in financial services regulation and federal taxation, can significantly impact the insurance industry and us.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the effect any enacted, proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the regulatory requirements applicable to our business will not become more stringent in the future or result in materially higher costs than current requirements. Changes in the regulation of our business may reduce our profitability, limit our growth or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nWe may experience financial exposure from climate change.\nA body of scientific evidence seems to indicate that climate change may be occurring. Climate change, to the extent that it may affect weather patterns, may cause an increase in the frequency and/or the severity of catastrophic events or severe weather conditions. Our financial exposure from climate change is most notably associated with losses in connection with the occurrence of hurricanes striking Florida. We mitigate the risk of financial exposure from climate change by restrictive underwriting criteria, sensitivity to geographic concentrations, and reinsurance.\nRestrictive underwriting criteria can include, but are not limited to, higher premiums and deductibles and more specifically excluded policy risks such as fences and screened-in enclosures. New technological advances in computer generated geographical mapping afford us an enhanced perspective as to geographic concentrations of policyholders and proximity to flood prone areas. Our amount of maximum reinsurance coverage is determined by subjecting our homeowner exposures to statistical forecasting models that are designed to quantify a catastrophic event in terms of the frequency of a storm occurring once in every \u201cn\u201d years. Additionally, if the statistical forecasting models fail to contemplate an emerging claim trend, such as the assignment of insurance benefits in Florida then there is the risk the Company may not purchase adequate catastrophic wind coverage. Our reinsurance coverage contemplates the effects of a catastrophic event that occurs only once every 100 years. Our amount of losses retained (our deductible) in connection with a catastrophic event is determined by market capacity, pricing conditions and surplus preservation. There can be no assurance that our reinsurance coverage and other measures taken will be sufficient to mitigate losses resulting from one or more catastrophic events.\nOur loss reserves are estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual liability for losses, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nWe maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liabilities for losses and LAE\u2019s. These reserves are estimates based on historical data and statistical projections of what we believe the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known to us. Actual loss and LAE reserves, however, may vary significantly from our estimates.\nFactors that affect loss and LAE reserves include the estimates made on a claim-by-claim basis known as \u201ccase reserves\u201d coupled with bulk estimates known as IBNR. Periodic estimates by management of the ultimate costs required to settle all claim files are based on the Company\u2019s analysis of historical data and estimations of the impact of numerous factors such as (i) per claim information; (ii) Company and industry historical loss experience, including the impact of trends such as the assignment of benefits by insureds; (iii) legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in the awarding of damages, and changes in political attitudes; and (iv) trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. Management revises its estimates based on the results of its analysis. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for estimating the ultimate settlement of all claims. There is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of the reserves, because the eventual redundancy or deficiency is affected by multiple factors.\nBecause of the uncertainties that surround estimated loss reserves, we cannot be certain that our reserves will be adequate to cover our actual losses. If our loss and LAE reserves are less than actual losses and LAE\u2019s, we will be required to increase our reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Future loss experience, substantially in excess of our loss and LAE reserves, could substantially harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur revenues and operating performance will fluctuate due to statutorily approved assessments that support property and casualty insurance pools and associations.\nWe operate in a regulatory environment where certain entities and organizations have the authority to require us to participate in assessments. Currently these entities and organizations include, but are not limited to, the Florida Joint Underwriters Association (\u201cJUA\u201d), the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association (\u201cFIGA\u201d), Citizens and the FHCF.\nThe insurance companies currently pass the assessments on to holders or insurance policies, in the form of a policy surcharge, and reflect the collection of these assessments as fully earned credits to operations in the period collected. The collection of these fees may adversely affect our overall marketing strategy due to the competitive landscape in Florida.\nIn addition, the impact of future assessments on our balance sheet, results of operations or cash flow are undeterminable at this time.\nOur investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses, which would significantly reduce our earnings.\nLike other insurance companies, we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a substantial portion of our earnings. During the time that normally elapses between the receipt of insurance premiums and any payment of insurance claims, we invest the premiums received, together with our other available capital, primarily in debt securities and to a lesser extent in equity securities, in order to generate investment income.\nOur investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as bonds, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. A significant increase in interest rates or decrease in credit worthiness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Generally, bond prices decrease as interest rates rise. Changes in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our investment income and results of operations. For example, if interest rates decline, investment of new premiums received and funds reinvested will earn less than expected.\nOur determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairment to record varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective investment type. We revise our evaluations and assessments as conditions change and new information becomes available, and we reflect changes in other-than- temporary impairments in our consolidated statements of income. We base our assessment of whether other-than-temporary impairments have occurred on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. We can neither provide assurance that we have accurately assessed whether the impairment of one or more of our investments is temporary or other-than-temporary, nor that we have accurately recorded amounts for other-than-temporary impairments in our financial statements. Furthermore, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments and additional impairments may need to be recorded in the future.\nIn addition, volatile and illiquid markets increase the likelihood that investment securities may not behave in historically predictable manners, resulting in fair value estimates that may be overstated compared with actual amounts that could be realized upon disposition or maturity of the security. The effects of market volatility and declining economic conditions may have unforeseen consequences on the credit quality, liquidity and financial stability of the issuers of securities we hold, or reinsurers with which we do business. Such deteriorations in financial condition can occur rapidly, leaving us unable to react to such a scenario in a prudent manner consistent with our historical practices in dealing with more orderly markets. This in turn could adversely and negatively affect our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nThe failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations.\nVarious provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which have been negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. At the present time we employ a variety of exclusions to our policies that limit exposure to known risks, including, but not limited to, exclusions relating to certain named liabilities, types of vehicles and specific artisan activities.\nIn addition, the policies we issue contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. While we believe our insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the loss exposure to us and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or that legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect our loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued.\nAnother example of an emerging trend is the assignment of homeowner benefits for a claim where a service provider agrees to make a repair that may be covered by an insurance policy in exchange for the policyholder\u2019s right to sue the insurance carrier directly. The assignment of the insurance benefits increases the Company\u2019s exposure to inflated claims, attorney fees and costs. Again several legislative actions in the State of Florida to limit the affect of assignment of benefits are being contemplated, although there can be no assurances that any such legislative actions will become law or, if enacted, that such actions will have the effect of limiting the impact on us of assignments of benefits by insureds.\nOur failure to pay claims accurately could adversely affect our business, financial results and capital requirements.\nWe must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, the culture of our claims organization and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors. Our failure to pay claims accurately could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial results.\nIn addition, if we do not train new claims adjusting employees effectively or if we lose a significant number of experienced claims adjusting employees, our claims department\u2019s ability to handle an increasing workload as we grow could be adversely affected. In addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, we could suffer decreased quality of claims work, which in turn could lower our operating margins.\nOur insurance company is subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nOur insurance company is subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws, including the laws of the State of Florida. The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require our insurance company to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company\u2019s total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital.\nIf we fail to meet the applicable risk-based capital or minimum statutory capital requirements imposed by the laws of Florida or other states where we do business, we could be subject to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on out writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation, and may be required to raise additional capital. Similarly, an increase in existing risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements may require us to increase our statutory capital levels.\nOur revenues and operating performance may fluctuate with business cycles in the property and casualty insurance industry.\nHistorically, the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical patterns characterized by periods of significant competition in pricing and underwriting terms and conditions, which is known as a \u201csoft\u201d insurance market, followed by periods of lessened competition and increasing premium rates, which is known as a \u201chard\u201d insurance market. Although an individual insurance company\u2019s financial performance is dependent on its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern, with profitability generally increasing in hard markets and decreasing in soft markets. At present, we are experiencing a softening market in the property and casualty market in Florida and in the other states we operate in because of increased competition. We cannot predict, however, how long these market conditions will persist. Although we do not compete entirely on price or targeted market share, negative market conditions may impair our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot write insurance at appropriate rates, our revenues and operating performance may be adversely affected.\nWe may not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to expand the types of insurance products we offer or the states in which we operate.\nThe insurance industry is highly regulated. Prior to selling a new insurance product in a state, we must obtain approval from the applicable state insurance regulators. The insurance regulators in states to which we might apply may request additional information, add conditions to the license that we find unacceptable, or deny our application. This would delay or prevent us from operating in that state. If we want to operate in any additional states, we must file similar applications for licenses, which we may not be successful in obtaining.\nAdverse ratings by insurance rating agencies may adversely impact our ability to write new policies, renew desirable policies or obtain adequate insurance, which could limit or halt our growth and harm our business.\nThird-party rating agencies assess and rate the ability of insurers to pay their claims. These financial strength ratings are used by the insurance industry to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. These ratings are based on criteria established by the rating agencies and reflect evaluations of each insurer\u2019s profitability, debt and cash levels, customer base, adequacy and soundness of reinsurance, quality and estimated market value of assets, adequacy of reserves, and management. Ratings are based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors, such as purchasers of our common stock.\nOur ability to compete successfully in states outside of Florida and to expand our business footprint may also be negatively affected by our lack of an A.M. Best Company rating of our financial strength. Although our insurance subsidiary has a Demotech rating of \u201cA\u201d (Exceptional), which is generally accepted in Florida and certain other states, a rating by A. M. Best is more widely accepted outside of Florida and may cause customers and agents to prefer a policy written by an A. M. Best-rated company over a policy written by us. In addition, some mortgage companies outside of Florida may require homeowners to obtain property insurance from an insurance company with a minimum A. M. Best rating.\nThe withdrawal of our ratings could limit or prevent us from writing or renewing desirable insurance policies, from competing with insurers who have higher ratings, from obtaining adequate reinsurance, or from borrowing on a line of credit. The withdrawal or downgrade of our ratings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position because our insurance products might no longer be acceptable to the secondary marketplace and mortgage lenders. Furthermore, a withdrawal or downgrade of our ratings could prevent independent agents from selling and servicing our insurance products or could increase the commissions we must pay to these agents.\nWe rely on independent and general agents to write our insurance policies, and if we are not able to attract and retain independent and general agents, our revenues would be negatively affected.\nWe currently market and distribute our products and services through contractual relationships with a network of independent agents and a selected number of general agents. Our independent agents are our primary source for our property and liability insurance policies. Many of our competitors also rely on independent agents. As a result, we must compete with other insurers for independent agents\u2019 business. Our competitors may offer a greater variety of insurance products, lower premiums for insurance coverage, or higher commissions to their agents. If our products, pricing and commissions do not remain competitive, we may find it more difficult to attract business from independent agents to sell our products. A material reduction in the amount of our products that independent agents sell or a material reduction in the number of independent agents with whom we maintain a relationship could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn February 2013, we entered into an Insurance Agency Master Agreement with Ivantage Select Agency, Inc., or ISA, an affiliate of Allstate Insurance Company, or Allstate, pursuant to which we are authorized by ISA to appoint Allstate agents to offer our homeowners\u2019 and commercial general liability insurance products to consumers in Florida. Since that time, our homeowners\u2019 premiums and the percentage of homeowners\u2019 premiums attributable to Allstate agents has increased rapidly. During 2015, 23.7% of the homeowners\u2019 premiums we underwrote were from Allstate\u2019s network of Florida agents, and this concentration may continue to increase. An interruption or change in our relationship with ISA could have a material adverse effect on the amount of premiums we are able to write, as well as our results of operations.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our business partners or vendors.\nOur business requires that we build and maintain computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers, agents and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. These systems are subject to attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities. Such attacks may include, among other things, attempts to gain unauthorized access to this confidential or proprietary data or attempts to disrupt or shut down the system. Additionally, an employee, consultant, vendor representative or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions, or be the subject of a security breach or cyber-attack, which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems, and in the loss or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers, agents or employees.\nWe undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. These efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection. While we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun.\nWe also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of third-party business partners and vendors, who provide software, hosting, communication, and other computer services to us. These third-party systems may experience cyber-attacks and other security breaches, which could result in the loss, theft or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers, agents or employees.\nOur business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-attack. In addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer, agent or employee information is stolen. This could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if trade secrets or other proprietary information is stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, resulting in a materially adverse effect on our ability to generate new and renewal business. To mitigate these costs, we carry a cyber-liability insurance policy. Our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all financial and other loss. Additionally, this policy will not afford us coverage for security breaches, data loss, or cyber-attacks experienced by our third-party business partners who have access to our customer, agent, or employee data.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and the failure of these systems could disrupt our operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our current information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations, as well as to perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development. As a result, the failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results. We utilize a third-party to provide certain information security related services designed to prevent an information security event or detect one timely. Although we have implemented security measures to protect our systems from computer viruses and intrusions by third parties, there can be no assurances that these measures will be effective.\nNonstandard automobile insurance historically has a higher frequency of claims than standard automobile insurance, thereby increasing our potential for loss exposure beyond what we would be likely to experience if we offered only standard automobile insurance.\nNonstandard automobile insurance is provided to insureds that are unable to obtain preferred or standard insurance coverage because of their payment histories, driving records, age, vehicle types, or prior claims histories. This type of automobile insurance historically has a higher frequency of claims than does preferred or standard automobile insurance policies, although the average dollar amount of the claim is usually smaller under nonstandard insurance policies. As a result, we are exposed to the possibility of increased loss exposure and higher claims experience than would be the case if we offered only standard automobile insurance.\nOur success depends on our ability to accurately price the risks we underwrite.\nThe results of operations and the financial condition of our insurance company depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, LAE\u2019s and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and price our products accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7 the availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data;\n\u00b7 the uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;\n\u00b7 our selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques;\n\u00b7 changes in legal standards, claim settlement practices, medical care expenses and restoration costs;\n\u00b7 regulatory restrictions; and\n\u00b7 legislatively imposed consumer initiatives.\nConsequently, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our sales volume and competitiveness. In either event, the profitability of our insurance company could be materially and adversely affected.\nCurrent operating resources are necessary to develop future new insurance products.\nWe currently intend to expand our product offerings by underwriting additional insurance products and programs, and marketing them through our distribution network. Expansion of our product offerings will result in increases in expenses due to additional costs incurred in actuarial rate justifications, software and personnel. Offering additional insurance products may also require regulatory approval, further increasing our costs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful bringing new insurance products to our marketplace in a manner that is profitable.\nIncreased competition, competitive pressures, industry developments and market conditions could affect the growth of our business and adversely impact our financial results.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from national, regional and residual market insurance companies in the homeowners\u2019, commercial general liability, and automobile markets, many of whom are larger, have greater financial and other resources, have higher financial strength ratings and offer more diversified insurance coverage. Our competitors include companies that market their products through agents, as well as companies that sell insurance directly to their customers. Large national writers may have certain competitive advantages over agency writers, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base and reduced policy acquisition costs. We may be forced to reduce our premiums significantly to compete, which could make us less profitable and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not meet the prices offered by our competitors, we may lose business in the short term, which could also result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMNIC has initially focused on the Florida homeowners\u2019 insurance market, which has increased our exposure to the factors that impact the Florida insurance market generally, such as the occurrence of hurricanes, trends in claims experience, and the impact of changes in Florida insurance law and regulations.\nMNIC is organized as a Florida property and casualty insurer and has initially focused primarily on the Florida homeowners\u2019 insurance market. As a result, the presence of MNIC in the Florida market increases our exposure to the factors that impact insurers in the Florida market generally, such as the occurrence of catastrophic events such as hurricanes, the trends experienced in administering and resolving claims resulting from the increased use of private adjusters, and the impact of changes in Florida\u2019s insurance laws and regulations. To the extent that these factors may adversely affect our operations, the presence of MNIC in the Florida market will have the effect of magnifying the effect of those factors.\nMNIC writes insurance policies that have a higher risk profile than those written by FNIC, allowing MNIC to reach a broader market and charge higher premiums. While MNIC underwriting standards avoids the highest risk policies, the occurrence of a catastrophic event could result in greater losses per policy for MNIC and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur executive management team is critical to the strategic direction of our company. If there were an unplanned loss of service by any of our officers our business could be harmed.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend, on the services of our executive management team which includes Michael H. Braun, Chief Executive Officer and President and Peter J. Prygelski III, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Our success also will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. If we were to lose the services of one or more members of our executive management team, our business could be adversely affected. Although we have employment agreements with our executive officers, any unplanned loss of service could substantially harm our business.\nNew homeowners\u2019 insurance operations outside of the State of Florida may not be profitable.\nWe plan to continue the expansion of admitted homeowners\u2019 property and casualty programs into other states as opportunities avail themselves. Risks associated with execution of our planned operations include the inability to market an adequately priced policy, inadequate commission structures, and overpriced or unavailable catastrophic reinsurance for wind events. Additionally, each state has its own authoritative body designed to regulate the insurance products and operations of new and existing insurance companies under their respective authority.\nThere can be no guarantees that our operations will be profitable in a given state nor can there be any guarantees that the state authorities will allow us to do business in that state.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Shares\nOur stock price in recent years has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile. As a result, the market price of our common stock may drop below the price you pay, and you may not be able to resell your shares at a profit.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility from time to time. Such volatility may be affected by various factors and events, such as:\n\u2022 our quarterly operating results, including a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 recognition of large unanticipated accounting charges, such as related to a loss reserve enhancement;\n\u2022 changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally;\n\u2022 the announcement of a material event or anticipated event involving us or our industry or the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022 the issuance of a significant number of shares; and\n\u2022 the other risk factors described in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein.\nIn recent years, the U.S. stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have sometimes affected the market price of the securities issued by a particular company in a manner unrelated to the operational performance of the company. This type of market effect could impact our common stock price as well. The volatility of our common stock means that the price of our common stock may have declined substantially at such time as you may look to sell your shares of our common stock. If our share price decreases, the value of your investment could decline.\nWe have authorized but unissued preferred stock, which could affect rights of holders of common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the preferred stock could be issued as a method of discouraging a takeover attempt. Although we do not intend to issue any preferred stock at this time, we may do so in the future.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and our bylaws, as amended, and the Florida Business Corporation Act could make it more difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and our bylaws presently contain certain provisions which may make it more difficult and time-consuming for shareholders or third parties to influence our management, policies or affairs, and may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change-in-control of the Company and offering a premium over the current market price of our common stock. These provisions include those which:\n\u2022 prohibit cumulative voting in the election of our directors,\n\u2022 establish a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms,\n\u2022 provide that the written request of shareholders holding not less than one-third of all votes entitled to be cast on an issue is required for shareholders to call special meetings of our shareholders,\n\u2022 establish advance notice and disclosure procedures for shareholders to bring matters, including nominations for election to our board, before a meeting of our shareholders, and\n\u2022 eliminate the ability of shareholders to take action by written consent in lieu of a shareholder meeting.\nAs a result, we may be less likely to receive unsolicited offers to acquire us that some of our shareholders might consider beneficial.\nThe Florida Business Corporation Act, as amended, contains provisions, which our directors have elected not to opt out of, that are designed to enhance the ability of our board to respond to and potentially defer attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions may discourage altogether takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board. These provisions may also adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for our common stock and, therefore, deprive you of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for your shares. These provisions could make the removal of our incumbent directors and management more difficult. These provisions may enable a minority of our directors and the holders of a minority of our outstanding voting stock or the holders of an existing control block to prevent, delay, discourage or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even though the transaction may be favorable to the interests of a majority of our non-affiliate shareholders. These provisions could also potentially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs a holding company, we depend on the earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay management fees and dividends to the holding company as the primary source of our income.\nWe are an insurance holding company whose primary assets are the stock of our subsidiaries. Our operations, and our ability to pay dividends or service future potential debt, are limited by the earnings of our subsidiaries and their payment of their earnings to us in the form of management fees, commissions, dividends, loans, advances or the reimbursement of expenses. These payments can be made only when our subsidiaries have adequate earnings. In addition, dividend payments made to us by our insurance subsidiary are restricted by Florida law governing the insurance industry. Generally, Florida law limits the dividends payable by insurance companies under complicated formulas based on the subsidiary\u2019s available capital and earnings.\nPayment of dividends in the future will depend on our earnings and financial position and such other factors, as our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, by us or by a major stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nIn addition, we may issue additional shares of our common stock from time to time in the future in amounts that may be significant. The sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely impact our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were 174,633 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding and exercisable stock options and 367,071 additional shares available for grant under our equity-based compensation plans. The market price of the common shares may be depressed by the potential exercise of these options or grant of these shares. The holders of these options are likely to exercise them when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional capital on more favorable terms than those provided by the options.", "PERMNO": 86435, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "FNHC"}
