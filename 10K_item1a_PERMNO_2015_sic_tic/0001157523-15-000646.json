You should consider the following risk factors, as well as other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report, before deciding to invest in our secrities. The following factors affect our business, our intellectual property, the industry in which we operate and our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or which we currently consider immaterial may also have an adverse effect on our business. If any of the matters discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe will be required to raise significant additional capital, and our ability to obtain funding is uncertain. If sufficient capital is not available, we may not be able to continue our operations as proposed (including the Phase IIb clinical trial ongoing for Tcelna, or any study planned for OPX-212 in NMO), which may require us to modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations, cease operations or seek relief under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.9 million. During 2012, we closed a private offering in July 2012 consisting of convertible secured notes and warrants to purchase common stock which generated approximately $4.1 million in gross proceeds. These convertible secured notes were converted into equity during 2013 and an aggregate of 2,002,926 shares of common stock were issued. From November 2012 through January 2013, we sold an aggregate of 390,000 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park for gross proceeds of $523,709 pursuant to our $1.5 million purchase agreement with Lincoln Park. We closed a private offering of unsecured convertible promissory notes and warrants to purchase common stock in January 2013 which generated $650,000 in gross proceeds. Upon receipt of the upfront payment from Merck Serono in February 2013, we repaid $550,000 principal amount plus accrued interest of the January 2013 notes and converted the remaining $100,000 principal amount into shares of common stock pursuant to the investor\u2019s election to convert into equity. In February 2013, we sold an aggregate of 167,618 shares of our common stock pursuant to a sales agreement executed on September 6, 2012 with Brinson Patrick Securities Corporation acting as sales agent under an \u201cat-the-market\u201d (ATM) program, for gross proceeds of $536,417. On February 4, 2013, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with Merck Serono pursuant to which we granted the Option to Merck Serono to acquire an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan) license to our Tcelna program for the treatment of MS in consideration for an upfront payment of $5 million. On February 11, 2013, we closed an offering of 1,083,334 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 541,668 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $3.25 million, or net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million after deducting commissions and offering expenses. On August 13, 2013, we closed an offering of 12 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $18 million, or net proceeds of approximately $16.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and we granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1.8 million shares of common stock to cover over-allotments. During September 2013, the underwriters of the August 2013 underwritten public offering exercised the over-allotment option granted to them which resulted in the issuance of an additional 900,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $1.35 million, or net proceeds of approximately $1.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On December 23, 2013, we closed an offering of 4,738,000 shares of common stock including the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters, raising gross proceeds of approximately $8.1 million or net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses. Between March 5, 2014 and December 31, 2014, we generated gross and net proceeds including amortization of deferred financing costs of $674,126 and $648,175, respectively, on sales of an aggregate of 518,412 shares of our common stock under an amendment to our ATM sales agreement pursuant to which Meyers Associates, L.P. (doing business as Brinson Patrick, a division of Meyers Associates, L.P.) became the new sales agent.\nOur operating cash burn rate during the 12 months ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $1.2 million per month. We reached our enrollment target for the Abili-T trial in June 2014, and a total of 190 patients have been enrolled in this two-year study. Costs associated with the ongoing Abili-T trial and the potential commencement of a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO may result in an increase in our monthly operating cash burn in 2015. However, costs associated with our ongoing preclinical and manufacturing activities for OPX-212 should not materially affect our cash burn through IND submission, which is expected by mid-2015. We will need to secure significant additional resources to complete the Abili-T trial of Tcelna in SPMS and, if initiated, to conduct a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO, as well as to support our operations during the course of the trials. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to support our current clinical activities for the Abili-T trial of Tcelna in SPMS, to continue planned preclinical development activities for OPX-212 in NMO with a possible IND submission by mid-2015, and for general operations to sustain the Company and support such activities into the fourth quarter of 2015. Any other costs, however, such as costs associated with the initiation and completion of a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO or with pursuing additional disease indications for our T-cell technology or other research or development programs, would of course shorten this period.\nGiven our need for substantial amounts of capital to complete the Abili-T clinical study of Tcelna in SPMS and to initiate and complete a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO, we intend to continue to explore potential opportunities and alternatives to obtain the significant additional resources, including one or more additional financing transactions, that will be necessary to complete the studies and to support our operations during the pendency of such studies. There can be no assurance that any such financings or potential opportunities and alternatives can be consummated on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding for operations beyond the projected runway, we will be forced to suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical trials, which may require us to modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations, cease operations or seek relief under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nOther than the $1.5 million purchase agreement and the $15.0 million purchase agreement we entered into with Lincoln Park on November 5, 2012 and November 2, 2012, respectively, each of which is subject to certain limitations and conditions, we have no sources of debt or equity capital committed for funding and we must rely upon best efforts third-party debt or equity funding. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in any funding effort. The timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to establish, enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing;\n\u25cf\nthe accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for capital needs in 2014 and beyond as well as for the clinical study of Tcelna;\n\u25cf\nscientific progress in our research and development programs;\n\u25cf\nthe magnitude and scope of our research and development programs;\n\u25cf\nour progress with preclinical development and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims; and\n\u25cf\nthe number and type of product candidates that we pursue.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, shareholders may experience substantial dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impede our ability to operate our business. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our shareholders. There is no assurance that our capital raising efforts will be able to attract the capital needed to execute on our business plan and sustain our operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional funding to support our current clinical trial activities beyond the projected runway, we may not be able to continue or complete the Phase IIb clinical study of Tcelna in SPMS and, if initiated, to continue or complete a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO, or otherwise continue our operations as proposed, which may require us to modify our business plan or curtail various aspects of our operations. If we are unable to maintain an adequate level of capital, it may be necessary to cease operations or seek relief under applicable bankruptcy laws. In such event, our shareholders may lose a portion or even all of their investment.\nWe may make changes to discretionary R&D investments that may have an impact on costs.\nWe are presently complementing the Abili-T clinical trial with an immune monitoring program. Expenses associated with the immune monitoring program are incurred at our discretion and are not required to satisfy any FDA-mandated criteria. Consequently, we may make changes to the parameters that are being analyzed, and these changes may result in either increased or decreased expenses for the study.\nWe may also incur discretionary expenses related to Phase I, Phase II and/or Phase III development programs, manufacturing scale-up/automation and technology transfer, research on additional indications and business development activities. There is no assurance that any such future expenses would be recovered by us.\nFunding from our purchase agreements with Lincoln Park and our ATM facility may be limited or be insufficient to fund our operations or to implement our strategy.\nUnder our $1.5 million purchase agreement and our $15.0 million purchase agreement with Lincoln Park, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $16.5 million of shares of common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions, over a 30-month period. From November 2012 through January 2013, we sold an aggregate of 390,000 shares to Lincoln Park pursuant to the $1.5 million purchase agreement, and we issued an aggregate of 56,507 initial commitment shares and 3,585 additional commitment shares in connection therewith. There can be no assurance that we will be able to receive any or all of the additional funds from Lincoln Park because the $1.5 million purchase agreement and the $15.0 million purchase agreement contain limitations, restrictions, requirements, events of default and other provisions that could limit our ability to cause Lincoln Park to buy common stock from us, including that the closing price of our stock is at least $1.00 and that Lincoln Park own no more than 4.99% of our common stock under the $1.5 million purchase agreement or no more than 9.99% of our common stock under the $15.0 million purchase agreement, and the requirement to keep current the prospectus included as part of the Form S-1 registration statement relating to the $15.0 million purchase agreement (which is not current as of this date). In addition, under the applicable rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market, if we seek to issue shares which may be aggregated with shares sold to Lincoln Park under the $1.5 million purchase agreement and the $15.0 million purchase agreement in excess of 1,151,829 shares or 19.99% of the total common stock outstanding as of the date of the $15.0 million purchase agreement, we may be required to seek shareholder approval in order to be in compliance with the NASDAQ Capital Market rules.\nThe extent to which we rely on Lincoln Park as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of working capital needed, the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from Lincoln Park were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we would need to secure another source of funding.\nWe will need to keep current the offering prospectus relating to the new ATM Agreement with Brinson Patrick, a division of Meyers Associates, L.P., in order to use the program to sell shares of our common stock. The number of shares and price at which we may be able to sell shares under the new ATM Agreement may be limited due to market conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nWe have a history of operating losses and do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not generated any profits since our entry into the biotechnology business and we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future. We have not received, and we do not expect to receive for at least the next several years, any revenues from the commercializ\u00adation of any potential products. We do not currently have any sources of revenues and may not have any in the foreseeable future.\nOur business is at an early stage of development. We are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, Tcelna, and we cannot be certain that Tcelna will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nOur business is at an early stage of development. We do not have any product candidates that have completed late-stage clinical trials nor do we have any products on the market. We have only one product candidate, Tcelna, which has progressed to the stage of being studied in human clinical trials in the United States. We announced the initiation of early development activities with our second pipeline candidate, OPX-212 in NMO. Tcelna, and any other potential products, including OPX-212, will require regulatory approval prior to marketing in the United States and other countries. Obtaining such approval requires significant research and development and preclinical and clinical testing. We may not be able to develop any products, to obtain regulatory approvals, to continue clinical development of Tcelna, to enter clinical trials (or any development activities) for any other product candidates (such as OPX-212) or to commercialize any products. Tcelna, and any other potential products (such as OPX-212), may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects or other characteristics adversely affecting their safety, efficacy or cost-effectiveness that could prevent or limit their use. Any product using any of our technology may fail to provide the intended therapeutic benefits or to achieve therapeutic benefits equal to or better than the standard of treatment at the time of testing or production.\nWe have provided Merck Serono with the Option, which provides Merck Serono with the opportunity, if exercised, to control the development and commercialization of Tcelna in MS.\nIn February 2013, we granted the Option to Merck Serono. The Option permits Merck Serono to acquire an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan) license of our Tcelna program for the treatment of MS. The Option may be exercised by Merck Serono prior to or upon completion of our ongoing Phase IIb trial of Tcelna in patients with SPMS. If Merck Serono exercises the Option, Merck Serono would be solely responsible for funding development, regulatory and commercialization activities for Tcelna in MS, although we would retain an option to co-fund certain development in exchange for increased royalty rates. We would also retain rights to Tcelna in Japan, certain rights with respect to the manufacture of Tcelna, and rights outside of MS. In consideration for the Option, we received an upfront payment of $5 million and may be eligible to receive an option exercise fee as well as milestone and royalty payments based on achievement of development and commercialization milestones. The rights we have relinquished to our product candidate Tcelna, including development and commercialization rights, may harm our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability.\nIf Merck Serono exercises the Option, we would become reliant on Merck Serono\u2019s resources and efforts with respect to Tcelna in MS. In such an event, Merck Serono may fail to develop or effectively commercialize Tcelna for a variety of reasons, including that Merck Serono:\n\u25cf\ndoes not have sufficient resources or decides not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as limited cash or human resources;\n\u25cf\ndecides to pursue a competitive potential product;\n\u25cf\ncannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\ndetermines that the market opportunity is not attractive; or\n\u25cf\ncannot manufacture or obtain the necessary materials in sufficient quantities from multiple sources or at a reasonable cost.\nIf Merck Serono does not exercise the Option, we may be unable to enter into a collaboration with any other potential partner on acceptable terms, if at all. We face competition in our search for partners from other organizations worldwide, many of whom are larger and are able to offer more attractive deals in terms of financial commitments, contribution of human resources, or development, manufacturing, regulatory or commercial expertise and support.\nIf Merck Serono does not exercise the Option, and we are not successful in attracting another partner and entering into collaboration on acceptable terms, we may not be able to complete development of or commercialize any product candidate, including Tcelna. In such event, our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability would be significantly hindered and we may not be able to continue operations as proposed, requiring us to modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations or cease operations.\nWe will need regulatory approvals for any product candidate, including Tcelna, prior to introduction to the market, which will require successful testing in clinical trials. Clinical trials are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, and are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement. Any product candidate, such as Tcelna, may fail to achieve necessary safety and efficacy endpoints during clinical trials in which case we will be unable to generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our products.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous FDA requirements, and must otherwise comply with federal, state and local requirements and policies of the medical institutions where they are conducted. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming. We reached our enrollment target for the Abili-T trial in June 2014, and a total of 190 patients have been enrolled in this two-year study. We expect top-line data for Tcelna to be available in the second half of 2016. In addition, we anticipate that at least a pivotal Phase III clinical trial would be necessary before an application could be submitted for approval of Tcelna for SPMS. Failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and problems could be encountered that would cause us or Merck Serono (in the event the Option is exercised) to be unable to initiate a trial, or to abandon or repeat a clinical trial.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials, including the continuation and completion of the Phase IIb clinical trial of Tcelna in SPMS, may be delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nFDA or IRB objection to proposed protocols;\n\u25cf\ndiscussions or disagreement with the FDA over the adequacy of trial design to potentially demonstrate effectiveness, and subsequent design modifications;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u25cf\ndetermination of dosing issues, epitope profiles, and related adjustments;\n\u25cf\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u25cf\nproduct quality problems (e.g., sterility or purity);\n\u25cf\nchallenges to patient monitoring, retention and data collection during or after treatment (e.g., patients\u2019 failure to return for follow-up visits or to complete the trial, detection of epitope profiles in subsequent visits, etc.); and\n\u25cf\nfailure of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we, Merck Serono with respect to Tcelna (if the Option is exercised) or the FDA (based on its authority over clinical studies) may delay a proposed investigation or suspend clinical trials in progress at any time if it appears that the study may pose significant risks to the study participants or other serious deficiencies are identified. Prior to approval of any product candidate, the FDA must determine that the data demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The large majority of drug candidates that begin human clinical trials fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy characteristics.\nFurthermore, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols, or otherwise modify our intended course of clinical development, to reflect these changes. This, too, may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. In light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products, and establishment of risk management programs that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained for any product candidate, such as Tcelna, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any potential products, whether directly or through any development arrangement (such as where Merck Serono exercises the Option) will be limited by any failure to obtain or limitation on necessary regulatory approvals.\nIf Merck Serono exercises the Option, Merck Serono would be solely responsible for funding development, regulatory and commercialization activities for Tcelna in MS, although we would retain an option to co-fund certain development in exchange for increased royalty rates.\nWe will rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis, which may result in costs and delays that may hamper our ability to successfully develop and commercialize any product candidate, including Tcelna.\nAlthough we have participated in the design and management of our past clinical trials, we do not have the ability to conduct clinical trials directly for any product candidate, including Tcelna. We will need to rely on contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials and to perform data collection and analysis, including the Phase IIb trial of Tcelna in patients with SPMS.\nOur clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated if:\n\u25cf\nany third party upon whom we rely does not successfully carry out its contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines;\n\u25cf\nlicenses needed from third parties for manufacturing in order to conduct Phase III trials or to conduct commercial manufacturing, if applicable, are not obtained;\n\u25cf\nany such third party needs to be replaced; or\n\u25cf\nthe quality or accuracy of the data obtained by the third party is compromised due to its failure to adhere to clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons.\nFailure to perform by any third party upon whom we rely may increase our development costs, delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and prevent the commercialization of any product candidate, including Tcelna. While we believe that there are numerous alternative sources to provide these services, we might not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without delays or additional expenditures if we were to seek such alternative sources.\nIf we fail to identify and license or acquire other product candidates, we will not be able to expand our business over the long term.\nWe have focused on MS as the first disease to be pursued off our T-cell platform technology, and we the initiation of NMO as the second disease we are pursuing. As a platform technology, there exists the potential to address other autoimmune diseases with the technology. Early development activities including preclinical and manufacturing activities have been initiated in OPX-212. The work in NMO is modest compared to the effort that has been committed to the lead MS indication. Our business over the long term is substantially dependent on our ability to develop, license or acquire product candidates and further develop them for commercialization. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to expand our existing platform or identify, select and acquire the right product candidates. We have limited experience identifying, negotiating and implementing economically viable product candidate acquisitions or licenses, which is a lengthy and complex process. Also, the market for licensing and acquiring product candidates is intensely competitive, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do. We may not have the requisite capital resources to consummate product candidate acquisitions or licenses that we identify to fulfill our strategy.\nMoreover, any product candidate acquisition that we do complete will involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in integrating the development program for the acquired product candidate into our existing operations;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf\nrisks of entering new potential markets or technologies;\n\u25cf\ninability to generate sufficient funding to offset acquisition costs; and\n\u25cf\ndelays that may result from our having to perform unanticipated preclinical trials or other tests on the product candidate.\nWe are dependent upon our management team and a small number of employees.\nOur business strategy is dependent upon the skills and knowledge of our management team. If any critical employee leaves, we may be unable on a timely basis to hire suitable replacements to operate our business effectively. We also operate with a very small number of employees and thus have little or no backup capability for their activities. The loss of the services of any member of our management team or the loss of just a few other employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under our license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends.\nOur business depends on licenses from third parties. These third party license agreements impose obligations on us, such as payment obligations and obligations diligently to pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents. We may also need to seek additional licenses as we move into Phase III trials and, if applicable, the commercial stage of operations. These licenses may require increased payments to the licensors. If a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation, our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, our ability to continue our business based on the affected technology platform could be adversely affected.\nOur research and manufacturing facility is not large enough to manufacture product candidates, such as Tcelna, for certain clinical trials or, if such clinical trials are successful, commercial applications.\nWe conduct our research and development in a 10,200 square foot facility in The Woodlands, Texas, which includes an approximately 1,200 square foot suite of three rooms for the manufacture of T-cell therapies. We believe our facility should have the capacity to support full clinical development of Tcelna in North American trials for SPMS and, if applicable, a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO. It is not sufficient, however, to support clinical trials outside North America including Europe and Asia, if required, or the commercial launch of Tcelna or any other product candidate. In this case, we would need to expand our manufacturing staff and facility, obtain a new facility, contract with corporate collaborators or other third parties to assist with future drug production and commercialization, or defer to Merck Serono (in the event the Option is exercised) to address manufacturing requirements.\nIn the event that we decide to establish a commercial-scale manufacturing facility, we will require substantial additional funds and will be required to hire and train significant numbers of employees and comply with applicable regulations, which are extensive. We do not have funds available for building a manufacturing facility, and we may not be able to build a manufacturing facility that both meets regulatory requirements and is sufficient for our commercial-scale manufacturing.\nWe may arrange with third parties for the manufacture of our future products, if any. However, our third-party sourcing strategy may not result in a cost-effective means for manufacturing our future products. If we employ third-party manufacturers, we will not control many aspects of the manufacturing process, including compliance by these third parties with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. We further may not be able to obtain adequate supplies from third-party manufacturers in a timely fashion for development or commercialization purposes, and commercial quantities of products may not be available from contract manufacturers at acceptable costs.\nProblems with our manufacturing process or with a manufacturing facility (whether ours or a third party\u2019s) could result in the failure to produce, or a delay in producing, adequate supplies of a product candidate such as Tcelna. A number of factors could cause interruptions or delays, including equipment malfunctions or failures, destruction or damage to a manufacturing facility due to natural disasters or otherwise, contamination of materials, changes in regulatory requirements or standards that require modifications to our manufacturing process, action by a regulatory agency or by a manufacturer (whether us or a third party) that results in the halting or slowdown of production due to regulatory issues, any third-party manufacturer going out of business or failing to produce as contractually required, or other similar factors.\nDifficulties, delays or interruptions in the manufacture and supply of a product candidate such as Tcelna could require us to stop treating patients in our clinical development of such product candidate and/or require a halt to or suspension of, or otherwise adversely affect, a clinical trial, thus increasing our costs and damaging our reputation. If a product candidate such as Tcelna is approved, difficulties, delays or interruptions in the manufacture and supply of such product candidate could cause a delay in or even halt or suspend the commercialization of such product candidate, potentially causing a partial or complete loss of revenue or market share.\nTcelna is manufactured using our proprietary ImmPath\u00ae technology for the production of an autologous T-cell immunotherapy utilizing a patient\u2019s own blood. Our manufacturing process may raise development issues that may not be resolvable, regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval, or personnel issues that may prevent the further development or commercialization, if approved, of any product candidate such as Tcelna.\nTcelna is based on our novel T-cell immunotherapy platform, ImmPath, which produces an autologous T-cell immunotherapy utilizing a patient\u2019s own blood. OPX-212 is expected to be similarly produced. The manufacture of living T-cell products requires specialized facilities, equipment and personnel which are different than the resources required for manufacturing chemical or biologic compounds. Scaling-out the manufacture of living cell products to meet demands for commercialization will require substantial amounts of such specialized facilities, equipment and personnel, especially where, as is the case for Tcelna and expected to be the case for OPX-212, the products are personalized and must be made for each patient individually. Because our manufacturing processes are complex, require facilities and personnel that are not widely available in the industry, involve equipment and training with long lead times, and the establishment of new manufacturing facilities is subject to a potentially lengthy regulatory approval process, alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or on reasonably terms, if at all. In addition, not many consultants or advisors in the industry have relevant experience and can provide guidance or assistance because active immune therapies such as Tcelna are fundamentally a new category of product in two major ways: (i) the product consists of living T-cells, not chemical or biologic compounds; and (ii) the product is personalized. There can be no assurance that manufacturing problems will not arise in the future which we may not be able to resolve or which may cause significant delays in development or, if any product candidate such as Tcelna is approved, commercialization.\nRegulatory approval of product candidates such as Tcelna that are manufactured using novel manufacturing processes such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to a lack of experience with them. FDA approval of personalized immunotherapy products has been limited to date. This lack of experience and precedent may lengthen the regulatory review process, require that additional studies or clinical trials be conducted, increase development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization, or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions.\nIn addition, the novel nature of product candidates such as Tcelna also means that fewer people are trained in or experienced with product candidates of this type, which may make it difficult to find, hire and retain capable personnel for research, development and manufacturing positions.\nIf any product we may eventually have is not accepted by the market or if users of any such product are unable to obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for such product from government and other third-party payors, our revenues and profitability will suffer.\nIn the instance of Tcelna, if Merck Serono exercises the Option then our ability to achieve revenue will be dependent upon the efforts and success of Merck Serono in developing and commercializing Tcelna. Our ability to successfully commercialize any product we may eventually have, to the extent applicable, and/or our ability to receive any revenue associated with Tcelna in the event Merck Serono exercises the Option, will depend in significant part on the extent to which appropriate coverage of and reimbursement for such product and any related treatments are obtained from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations, or HMOs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party payors will consider any product cost-effective or provide coverage of and reimbursement for such product, in whole or in part.\nUncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved medical products and services and newly approved indications for existing products. Third-party payors may conclude that any product is less safe, less clinically effective, or less cost-effective than existing products, and third-party payors may not approve such product for coverage and reimbursement. If adequate coverage of and reimbursement for any product from third-party payors cannot be obtained, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them. Such reduction or limitation in the use of any such product would cause sales to suffer. Even if third-party payors make reimbursement available, payment levels may not be sufficient to make the sale of any such product profitable.\nIn addition, the trend towards managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of medical services and products, may result in inadequate coverage of and reimbursement for any product we may eventually have. Many third-party payors, including in particular HMOs, are pursuing various ways to reduce pharmaceutical costs, including, for instance, the use of formularies. The market for any product depends on access to such formularies, which are lists of medications for which third-party payors provide reimbursement. These formularies are increasingly restricted, and pharmaceutical companies face significant competition in their efforts to place their products on formularies of HMOs and other third-party payors. This increased competition has led to a downward pricing pressure in the industry. The cost containment measures that third-party payors are instituting could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate profitably.\nAny product candidate, such as Tcelna, if approved for sale, may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenues.\nEven if a product candidate, such as Tcelna, is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate by physicians, healthcare professionals and third-party payors, and our profitability and growth, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ndemonstration of efficacy;\n\u25cf\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\navailability and cost of alternative treatments, including cheaper generic drugs;\n\u25cf\npricing and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory control;\n\u25cf\neffectiveness of sales and marketing strategies for the product and competition for such product;\n\u25cf\nthe product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries; and\n\u25cf\nthe availability of adequate third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nIf any product candidate does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from that product candidate would be substantially reduced.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs and risks as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ). Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of SOX and rules adopted by the SEC and by NASDAQ, have resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. Given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting is uncertain. If our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively, we may not be able to conclude an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required or we or our independent registered public accounting firm may determine that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. In addition, our registered public accounting firm may either disclaim an opinion as it relates to management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls or may issue an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and which could affect our ability to run our business as we otherwise would like to. New rules could also make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our Board committees and as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the total amount of the costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with these rules and regulations.\nUnder the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ, a majority of our Board of Directors and each member of our Audit and Compensation Committees must be an independent director. If any vacancies on our Board or our Audit or Compensation Committees occur that need to be filled by independent directors, we may encounter difficulty in attracting qualified persons to serve on our Board and, in particular, our Audit Committee. If we fail to attract and retain the required number of independent directors, we may be subject to SEC enforcement proceedings and delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAny acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe expect to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies on a global geographic footprint. We may also consider joint ventures, licensing and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate acquisitions of any businesses, products or technologies. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition and management of any collaborative project may divert our management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We do not have any experience with acquiring companies, or with acquiring products outside of the United States. Any cash acquisition we pursue would potentially divert the cash we have on our balance sheet from our present clinical development programs. Any stock acquisitions would dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership. While we from time to time evaluate potential collaborative projects and acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions or collaborative projects.\nRisks Related to Doing Business Internationally\nWe plan to do business internationally, which may prove to be difficult and fraught with economic, regulatory and political issues. We may acquire or in-license foreign companies or technologies or commercialize our T-cell or stem cell platform in countries where the business, economic and political climates are very different from those of the United States. We may not be aware of some of these issues and it may be difficult for a U.S. company to overcome these issues and ultimately become profitable. Certain foreign countries may favor businesses that are owned by nationals of those countries as opposed to foreign-owned business operating locally. As a small company, we may not have the resources to engage in the negotiation and time-consuming work needed to overcome some of these potential issues.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nPatents obtained by other persons may result in infringement claims against us that are costly to defend and which may limit our ability to use the disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of potential products, such as Tcelna.\nIf third party patents or patent applications contain claims infringed by either our licensed technology or other technology required to make or use our potential products, such as Tcelna, and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, if at all, or be able to develop or obtain alternative technology. If we are unable to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, we (or, in the event the Option is exercised, Merck Serono with respect to Tcelna) may not be able to develop any affected product candidate commercially. There can be no assurance that we will not be obliged to defend ourselves (or, in the event the Option is exercised, Merck Serono with respect to Tcelna) in court against allegations of infringement of third party patents. Patent litigation is very expensive and could consume substantial resources and create significant uncertainties. An adverse outcome in such a suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties, or require us to cease using such technology.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent protection and other proprietary rights, our operations will be significantly harmed.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent upon obtaining patent protection relating to our technologies. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. The coverage sought in a patent application can be denied or significantly reduced before or after the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether pending patent applications for our technology will result in the issuance of patents, or if any issued patents will provide significant protection or commercial advantage or will be circumvented by others. Since patent applications are secret until the applications are published (usually 18 months after the earliest effective filing date), and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that the inventors of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights were the first to make the inventions at issue or that any patent applications at issue were the first to be filed for such inventions. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from pending patent applications or, if issued, that such patents will be of commercial benefit to us, afford us adequate protection from competing products, or not be challenged or declared invalid.\nIssued U.S. patents require the payment of maintenance fees to continue to be in force. We rely on a third party payor to do this and their failure to do so could result in the forfeiture of patents not timely maintained. Many foreign patent offices also require the payment of periodic annuities to keep patents and patent applications in good standing. As we may not maintain direct control over the payment of all such annuities, we cannot assure you that our third party payor will timely pay such annuities and that the granted patents and pending patent applications will not become abandoned. In addition, we or our licensors may have selected a limited amount of foreign patent protection, and therefore applications have not been filed in, and foreign patents may not have been perfected in, all commercially significant countries.\nThe patent protection of product candidates, such as Tcelna, involves complex legal and factual questions. To the extent that it would be necessary or advantageous for any of our licensors to cooperate or lead in the enforcement of our licensed intellectual property rights, we cannot control the amount or timing of resources such licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on enforcing such rights. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against third party infringement, which may be difficult to detect. Additionally, challenges may be made to the ownership of our intellectual property rights, our ability to enforce them, or our underlying licenses.\nWe cannot be certain that any of the patents issued to us or to our licensors will provide adequate protection from competing products. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we or our licensors can:\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain patents to protect our product candidates such as Tcelna;\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain any required or desirable licenses to use certain technologies of third parties, which may be protected by patents;\n\u25cf\nprotect our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u25cf\noperate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others;\n\u25cf\nenforce the issued patents under which we hold rights; and\n\u25cf\ndevelop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights (owned or licensed) is uncertain. For example:\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensor might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patents owned by, or licensed to, us;\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensor might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of the technologies owned by, or licensed to, us;\n\u25cf\nit is possible that none of the pending patent applications owned by, or licensed to, us will result in issued patents;\n\u25cf\nany patents under which we hold rights may not provide us with a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties as invalid, or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws; or\n\u25cf\nany of the issued patents under which we hold rights may not be valid or enforceable or may be circumvented successfully in light of the continuing evolution of domestic and foreign patent laws.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\nWe rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Further, we have limited control, if any, over the protection of trade secrets developed by our licensors. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nA dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\nA number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or have been issued patents relating to cell therapy, T-cells, and other technologies potentially relevant to or required by our product candidates such as Tcelna. We cannot predict which, if any, of such applications will issue as patents or the claims that might be allowed. We are aware of a number of patent applications and patents claiming use of modified cells to treat disease, disorder or injury.\nThere is significant litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates, such as Tcelna, or their methods of use, manufacturing or other technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties. If our product candidates, such as Tcelna, or their methods of manufacture are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses under such patents. We have not conducted comprehensive searches of patents issued to third parties relating to Tcelna or OPX-212. Consequently, no assurance can be given that third-party patents containing claims covering Tcelna or OPX-212, their methods of use or manufacture do not exist or have not been filed and will not be issued in the future. Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, and because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications that will mature into issued patents that relate to our current or future product candidates that could have a material effect in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates. A patent holder could prevent us from importing, making, using or selling the patented compounds. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Similarly, we may be subject to claims that we have inappropriately used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of third parties. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. We may not be able to afford the costs of litigation. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:\n\u25cf\npayment of actual damages, royalties, lost profits, potentially treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u25cf\ninjunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell our products;\n\u25cf\nwe or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all; or\n\u25cf\nsignificant cost and expense, as well as distraction of our management from our business.\nAs a result, we could be prevented from commercializing current or future product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to stringent regulation of our product candidates, such as Tcelna, which could delay development and commercialization.\nWe, our third-party contractors, suppliers and partners (such as Merck Serono, in the event the Option is exercised, with respect to Tcelna), and our product candidates, such as Tcelna, are subject to stringent regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. None of our product candidates can be marketed in the United States until it has been approved by the FDA. No product candidate of ours has been approved, and we may never receive FDA approval for any product candidate. Obtaining FDA approval typically takes many years and requires substantial resources. Even if regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use and labeling of such products. Additionally, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. These regulatory requirements may limit the size of the market for the product or result in the incurrence of additional costs. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could substantially reduce our ability to generate revenues.\nIn addition, both before and after regulatory approval, we, our partners and our product candidates, such as Tcelna, are subject to numerous FDA requirements covering, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution and export. The FDA\u2019s requirements may change and additional government regulations may be promulgated that could affect us, our partners and our product candidates, such as Tcelna. Given the number of recent high profile adverse safety events with certain drug products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk management programs, which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, preapproval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising. Furthermore, heightened Congressional scrutiny on the adequacy of the FDA\u2019s drug approval process and the agency\u2019s efforts to assure the safety of marketed drugs resulted in the enactment of legislation addressing drug safety issues, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. This legislation provides the FDA with expanded authority over drug products after approval and the FDA\u2019s exercise of this authority could result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, and increased costs to assure compliance with new post-approval regulatory requirements. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from this or future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.\nIn order to market any of our products outside of the United States, we and our strategic partners and licensees must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods and the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. Approval by the FDA does not automatically lead to the approval of authorities outside of the United States and, similarly, approval by other regulatory authorities outside the United States will not automatically lead to FDA approval. In addition, regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Our product candidates, such as Tcelna, may not be approved for all indications that we request, which would limit uses and adversely impact our potential royalties and product sales. Such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which any potential product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketing follow-up studies.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States and other countries, among other things, we may be subject to fines and other civil penalties, delays in approving or failure to approve a product, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials, injunctions and criminal prosecution, any of which would harm our business.\nWe may need to change our business practices to comply with health care fraud and abuse regulations, and our failure to comply with such laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Merck Serono exercises the Option, Merck Serono would be solely responsible for funding development, regulatory and commercialization activities for Tcelna in MS, although we would retain an option to co-fund certain development in exchange for increased royalty rates. Otherwise, if we are successful in achieving approval to market one or more of our product candidates, our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, or OIG, to issue a series of regulations, known as the \u201csafe harbors.\u201d These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, sometimes known as \u201crelators\u201d or, more commonly, as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claims Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.\nIn addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.\nBeginning August 1, 2013, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the \u201cSunshine Act\u201d), which is part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals or medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal health care programs to track and then report certain payments and items of value given to U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals (defined as \u201cCovered Recipients\u201d). The Sunshine Act requires that manufacturers collect this information on a yearly basis and then report it to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by the 90th day of each subsequent year.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nIf our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our product candidates, they may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunities.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the market for MS products, is intense, and we expect such competition to continue to increase. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, in the United States and abroad. Our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development and may succeed in developing drugs that are more effective, safer and more affordable or more easily administered than ours, or that achieve patent protection or commercialization sooner than our products. Our most significant competitors are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies. These companies have significantly greater capital resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing than we currently do. However, smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaboration arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. In addition to the competitors with existing products that have been approved, many of our competitors are further along in the process of product development and also operate large, company-funded research and development programs. As a result, our competitors may develop more competitive or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or further product commercialization than we are able to achieve. Competitive products may render any products or product candidates that we develop obsolete.\nOur competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any products that we may develop.\nRapid technological change could make our products obsolete.\nBiopharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change, and we expect that they will continue to do so. As a result, there is significant risk that our product candidates, such as Tcelna, may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by new discoveries before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with their development. If our product candidates, such as Tcelna, are rendered obsolete by advancements in biopharmaceutical technologies, our future prospects will suffer.\nConsumers may sue us for product liability, which could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our available resources and damage our reputation.\nDeveloping and commercializing drug products entails significant product liability risks. Liability claims may arise from our and our collaborators\u2019 use of products in clinical trials and the commercial sale of those products.\nIn the event that any of our product candidates becomes an approved product and is commercialized, consumers may make product liability claims directly against us and/or our partners (such as Merck Serono, in the event the Option is exercised, with respect to Tcelna), and our partners or others selling these products may seek contribution from us if they incur any loss or expenses related to such claims. We have insurance that covers clinical trial activities. We believe our insurance coverage as of the date hereof is reasonably adequate at this time. However, we will need to increase and expand this coverage as we commence additional clinical trials, as well as larger scale trials, and if any product candidate is approved for commercial sale. This insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the regulatory approval or commercialization of products that we or one of our collaborators develop. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Liability from such claims could exceed our total assets if we do not prevail in any lawsuit brought by a third party alleging that an injury was caused by one or more of our products.\nGovernment controls and health care reform measures could adversely affect our business.\nThe business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care. In the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system. For example, in some foreign countries, particularly in Europe, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of any product candidate, such as Tcelna, to other available therapies. If reimbursement of any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in such country. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. Any negotiated prices for any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved, covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices that might otherwise be obtained outside of the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Moreover, while Medicare Part D applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment under Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.\nThe United States and several other jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved. Among policy-makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect: the demand for any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved; the ability to set a price that we believe is fair for any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved; our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and the availability of capital.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA), became law in the United States. The goal of the ACA is to reduce the cost of healthcare and substantially change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of any product candidate such as Tcelna, if approved. Provisions of the ACA relevant to the pharmaceutical industry include the following: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts on negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level beginning in 2014, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability; expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; new requirements under the federal Open Payments program and its implementing regulations; and expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.\nAnother example of reform that could affect our business is drug reimportation into the United States (i.e., the reimportation of approved drugs originally manufactured in the United States back into the United States from other countries where the drugs were sold at lower prices). Initiatives in this regard could decrease the price we or any potential collaborators receive for our product candidates if they are ever approved for sale, adversely affecting our future revenue growth and potential profitability. Moreover, the pendency or approval of such proposals could result in a decrease in our stock price or adversely affect our ability to raise capital or to obtain strategic partnerships or licenses.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThere is currently a limited market for our securities, and any trading market that exists in our securities may be highly illiquid and may not reflect the underlying value of our net assets or business prospects.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, there is currently a limited market for our securities and there can be no assurance that an active market will ever develop. Investors are cautioned not to rely on the possibility that an active trading market may develop.\nOur stock may be delisted from NASDAQ, which could affect its market price and liquidity.\nWe are required to meet certain qualitative and financial tests (including a minimum bid price for our common stock of $1.00 per share and a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million), as well as certain corporate governance standards, to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. It is possible that we could fail to satisfy one or more of these requirements. Since November 2014, our stock has continued to trade below the minimum bid price continued listing requirement, and our common stock is in jeopardy of being delisted. On December 5, 2014, we received a staff deficiency letter from NASDAQ indicating that our common stock failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement because it closed below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price for 30 consecutive trading days. The notice further stated that we will be provided a period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance. If our common stock maintains a closing bid price of $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days (or such longer period of time as the NASDAQ staff may require in some circumstances, but generally not more than 20 consecutive business days) before June 3, 2015, we will achieve compliance with the listing standards. If our common stock does not achieve compliance with the minimum bid price by June 3, 2015, we may be eligible for an additional 180 day grace period so long as we continue to meet the other listing standards and provide timely notice of our intention to cure the deficiency. However, if it appears to the NASDAQ staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we do not meet the other listing standards, NASDAQ could provide notice that our stock will become subject to delisting.\nWe previously received a similar staff deficiency letter in February 2012 indicating that our common stock failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement because it traded below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price for 30 consecutive trading days, and after an initial and an extended grace period, and implementation of a one-for-four reverse stock split of our common stock on December 14, 2012, we regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price listing standard and NASDAQ notified us that the matter was closed in January 2013. We also received a staff deficiency letter in November 2012 notifying us that the stockholders\u2019 equity of $2,339,285 as reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012 was below the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million required for continued listing on NASDAQ. We were provided 45 calendar days, or until January 10, 2013, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity standard. We submitted such a plan and it was accepted, with NASDAQ thus granting us an extension until May 15, 2013 to evidence compliance with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity standard. Upon executing the plan, we attained the necessary stockholders\u2019 equity level and subsequently received notice from NASDAQ that we had regained compliance with the listing standard and the matter was closed in May 2013.\nWhile we are exercising diligent efforts to maintain the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price, stockholder\u2019s equity or other listing standards in the future. We may receive additional future notices from NASDAQ that we have failed to meet its requirements, and proceedings to delist our stock could be commenced. In such event, NASDAQ rules permit us to appeal any delisting determination to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel. If we are unable to maintain or regain compliance in a timely manner and our common stock is delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell our common stock and obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our stock could suffer a material decline. Delisting may also impair our ability to raise capital.\nOur share price is volatile, and you may not be able to resell our shares at a profit or at all.\nThe market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and early-stage drug discovery and development companies like us in particular, have historically been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf\nthe development status of any drug candidates, such as Tcelna, including clinical study results and determinations by regulatory authorities with respect thereto;\n\u25cf\nthe initiation, termination, or reduction in the scope of any collaboration arrangements (such as developments involving Merck Serono and the Option, including a decision by Merck Serono to exercise or not exercise the Option) or any disputes or developments regarding such collaborations;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations, new commercial products or other material events by our competitors or us;\n\u25cf\ndisputes or other developments concerning our proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nchanges in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations of our financial performance;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ndiscussions of our business, products, financial performance, prospects or stock price by the financial and scientific press and online investor communities;\n\u25cf\npublic concern as to, and legislative action with respect to, the pricing and availability of prescription drugs or the safety of drugs and drug delivery techniques;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the United States and in foreign countries; or\n\u25cf\ndilutive effects of sales of shares of common stock by us or our shareholders, and sales of common stock acquired upon exercise or conversion by the holders of warrants, options or convertible notes.\nBroad market and industry factors, as well as economic and political factors, also may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be or become the target of securities litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities or the reporting of unfavorable news, security holders have often instituted class action litigation. If the market value of our securities experience adverse fluctuations and we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, causing our business to suffer.\nOur \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock could be issued to prevent a business combination not desired by management or our majority shareholders.\nOur charter authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval. Our preferred stock could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in our control and as a method of preventing shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares in connection with a change of control.\nFuture sales of our securities could cause dilution, and the sale of such securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall.\nIn July 2012, we closed a private offering consisting of convertible secured notes and warrants to purchase common stock which generated approximately $4.1 million in gross proceeds, of which notes in the aggregate principal amount of $900,000 were converted into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock which, in turn, were converted into an aggregate of 288,229 shares of common stock during February 2013. The remaining notes were converted into an aggregate of 1,714,697 shares of common stock at $1.91 per share on September 24, 2013. From November 2012 through January 2013, we sold an aggregate of 390,000 shares to Lincoln Park pursuant to the $1.5 million purchase agreement and issued an additional 56,507 shares as initial commitment shares and 3,585 shares as additional commitment shares. In January 2013, we issued $650,000 principal amount of unsecured convertible promissory notes of which $100,000 was converted into 77,034 shares of common stock at $1.298125 per share during February 2013 and the remaining $550,000 of principal amount plus accrued interest was repaid during February 2013. Purchasers of such notes also received five-year warrants to acquire an aggregate of 243,750 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.24 per share. In February 2013, we sold an aggregate of 167,618 shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement for gross proceeds of $536,417. On February 11, 2013, we closed on an offering of 1,083,334 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 541,668 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $3.25 million, or net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million after deducting commissions and offering expenses. On August 13, 2013, we closed an offering of 12 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $18 million, or net proceeds of approximately $16.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and we granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1.8 million shares of common stock to cover over-allotments. During September 2013, the underwriters of the August 2013 underwritten public offering exercised the over-allotment option granted to them which resulted in the issuance of an additional 900,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $1.35 million, or net proceeds of approximately $1.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On December 23, 2013, we closed an offering of 4,738,000 shares of common stock, including the full exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters, raising gross proceeds of $8.1 million or net proceeds of approximately $7.3 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses. Between March 5, 2014 and December 31, 2014, we generated gross and net proceeds including amortization of deferred financing costs of $674,126 and $648,175, respectively, on sales of an aggregate of 518,412 shares of our common stock under the new ATM Agreement.\nSales of additional shares of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, could result in substantial dilution to our shareholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. An aggregate of 28,234,751 shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2014, 2014. As of such date, another (i) 2,423,253 shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and (ii) 3,046,801 shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. A substantial majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, in subsequent public or private offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, to finance future acquisitions. Among other requirements, we will need to raise significant additional capital in order to complete the Phase IIb clinical study of Tcelna in SPMS, and, if initiated, to complete a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO, and this may require us to issue a substantial amount of securities (including common stock as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock). There can be no assurance that our capital raising efforts will be able to attract the capital needed to execute on our business plan and sustain our operations. Moreover, we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or securing funds to complete our clinical trial plans, or the perception that such sales could occur, may result in substantial dilution and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nUnder the $1.5 million purchase agreement and $15.0 million purchase agreement with Lincoln Park, we may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to $16.5 million of shares of common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions, over a 30-month period. We have sold an aggregate of 390,000 shares to date under the $1.5 million purchase agreement. Additionally, we issued Lincoln Park 56,507 shares of common stock as initial commitment shares and have issued an aggregate of 3,585 additional commitment shares, and may in the future issue up to an additional 109,428 shares of common stock as additional commitment shares, as a fee for its commitment to purchase the shares under the $1.5 million purchase agreement and the $15.0 million purchase agreement. The purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock and other factors determined by us. As such, Lincoln Park may ultimately purchase all, some or none of the shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the purchase agreements after the date hereof and, after it has acquired shares, Lincoln Park may sell all, some or none of those shares. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us pursuant to either or both of the purchase agreements could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future.\nWe presently do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently anticipate that no cash dividends will be paid on the common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is anticipated that all earnings, if any, will be retained to finance the future expansion of our business.\nOur shareholders may experience substantial dilution in the value of their investment if we issue additional shares of our capital stock.\nOur charter allows us to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of our common stock and to issue and designate the rights of, without shareholder approval, up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by other investors, and dilution to our shareholders could result. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by other investors.\nWe may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, guarantees, preferred stock, hybrid securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive distributions of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings may be influenced by market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings or debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nOur management has significant flexibility in using our current available cash.\nIn addition to general corporate purposes (including working capital, research and development, business development and operational purposes), we currently intend to use our available cash (i) to continue funding the ongoing Abili-T clinical study of Tcelna in patients with SPMS, and (ii) to continue preclinical and manufacturing activities for OPX-212 in patients with NMO, and if such activities are successful, to file an IND application with the FDA to initiate a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study. We reached our enrollment target for the Abili-T trial in June 2014, and a total of 190 patients have been enrolled in this two-year study. We expect top-line data for Tcelna to be available in the second half of 2016. Our existing resources are not adequate to permit us to complete the ongoing Abili-T clinical study of Tcelna in patients with SPMS or, if initiated, to conduct a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO. We will need to secure significant additional resources to complete the ongoing Abili-T clinical study of Tcelna in patients with SPMS and, if initiated, to conduct a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of OPX-212 in NMO and to support our operations during the course of the trials.\nDepending on future developments and circumstances, we may use some of our available cash for other purposes which may have the potential to decrease the forecasted cash runway. Notwithstanding our current intentions regarding use of our available cash, our management will have significant flexibility with respect to such use. The actual amounts and timing of expenditures will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of cash used in our operations and our research and development efforts. Management\u2019s failure to use these funds effectively would have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock and could make it more difficult and costly to raise funds in the future.\nRisks Related to our Securities due to our Currently Proposed Rights Offering\nOn January 28, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-201731) (the \u201cregistration statement\u201d) with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed rights offering of subscription rights to purchase Units comprised of a share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional share of our common stock (the \u201cRights Offering\u201d). Holders of our common stock and holders of our Series L warrants on the record date for the Rights Offering, which is yet to be determined, would be eligible to participate. The registration statement has not yet become effective. We may not sell the securities that are the subject of the registration statement nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. The Rights Offering, which is expected to commence immediately following the effectiveness of the registration statement, will only be made by means of a prospectus. The following risks related to our securities are due to the Rights Offering, however; we can give no assurance that the registration statement will become effective, that the Rights Offering will be commenced or that the Rights Offering will ultimately be consummated or be successful.\nWe will incur substantial expenses in connection with the Rights Offering, which may not return adequate value if the Rights Offering is ultimately not consummated or successful.\nThe estimated expenses for the Rights Offering are approximately $750,000, excluding fees and expenses of the dealer-managers that we have engaged to assist us with the Rights Offering. If the registration statement is not declared effective, the Rights Offering is not commenced or the Rights Offering is not ultimately consummated or successful, we will incur these expenses nonetheless. In addition, we have agreed to pay fees to the dealer-managers as follows: (i) to Maxim Group LLC, a cash fee equal to (a) 1% of the gross proceeds received by us directly from exercises of the subscription rights if the amount of such gross proceeds is less than $6 million; (b) 4% of the gross proceeds received by us directly from exercises of the subscription rights if the amount of such gross proceeds is at least $6 million but less than $10 million; and (c) 4.5% of the gross proceeds received by us directly from exercises of the subscription rights if the amount of such gross proceeds is at least $10 million; (ii) to National Securities Corporation, a cash fee equal to 2.75% of the gross proceeds received by us directly from exercises of the subscription rights if the amount of such gross proceeds is at least $6 million. We have also agreed to reimburse the dealer-managers for their expenses as follows: (i) up to $50,000 if the gross proceeds received by us directly from exercises of the subscription rights is less than $6 million; and (ii) up to $100,000 if the gross proceeds received by us directly from exercises of the subscription rights is at least $6 million.\nYour interest in our company may be diluted as a result of the Rights Offering.\nShareholders who do not fully exercise their subscription rights should expect that they will, at the completion of the Rights Offering, own a smaller proportional interest in our company than would otherwise be the case had they fully exercised their basic subscription right and over-subscription privilege, as described in the registration statement. In addition, the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants to be issued pursuant to the Rights Offering will dilute the ownership interest of shareholders not participating in the offering or holders of warrants issued pursuant to the Rights Offering who do not exercise them.\nFurther, because the price per share of our common stock being offered may be substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our common stock, a purchase of shares of common stock in the Rights Offering offering at the subscription price described in the registration statement may cause the purchaser to suffer immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the common stock.\nCompletion of the Rights Offering is not subject to us raising a minimum offering amount.\nCompletion of the Rights Offering is not subject to us raising a minimum offering amount and therefore proceeds may be insufficient to meet our objectives, thereby increasing the risk to investors who participate in the Rights Offering, including investing in a company that continues to require capital.\nThe dealer-managers are not underwriting, nor acting as placement agents of, the subscription rights or the securities underlying the subscription rights.\nMaxim Group LLC and National Securities Corporation will act as dealer-managers for the Rights Offering. Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the dealer-manager agreement, the dealer-managers will provide marketing assistance in connection with the offering. The dealer-managers are not underwriting or placing any of the subscription rights or the shares of our common stock or warrants being issued in the Rights Offering and do not make any recommendation with respect to such subscription rights (including with respect to the exercise or expiration of such subscription rights), shares or warrants. The dealer-managers will not be subject to any liability to us in rendering the services contemplated by the dealer-manager agreement except for any act of bad faith or gross negligence by the dealer-managers. The services of the dealer-managers to us in this connection cannot be construed as any assurance that the offering will be successful.\nThe Rights Offering may cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease.\nThe subscription price, together with the number of shares of common stock we propose to issue and ultimately will issue if the Rights Offering is completed, may result in an immediate decrease in the market price of our common stock. This decrease may continue after the completion of the Rights Offering. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that the availability of shares for future sale represented by the warrants issued in connection with the Rights Offering will have on the market price of our common stock from time to time. Further, if a substantial number of subscription rights are exercised and the holders of the shares received upon exercise of those subscription rights or the related warrants choose to sell some or all of the shares underlying the subscription rights or the related warrants, the resulting sales could depress the market price of our common stock. Following the exercise of a holder\u2019s subscription rights, such holder may not be able to sell such holder\u2019s common stock at a price equal to or greater than the subscription price.\nPurchasers may commit to buying shares of common stock above the prevailing market price.\nOnce an exercise is made of the subscription rights, the exercising holder may not revoke such exercise even if such holder later learns information that such holder considers to be unfavorable to the exercise of subscription rights. The market price of our shares of common stock may decline prior to the expiration of the offering or a subscribing rights holder may not be able to sell shares of common stock purchased in the offering at a price equal to or greater than the subscription price. Until shares of our common stock are delivered upon expiration of the Rights Offering, an exercising holder will not be able to sell or transfer the shares of our common stock that such holders purchases in the Rights Offering. Any such delivery will occur as soon as practicable after the Rights Offering has expired, payment for the shares of common stock and attached warrants subscribed for has cleared, and all prorating calculations and reductions contemplated by the terms of the Rights Offering have been effected.\nIf we terminate the Rights Offering for any reason, we will have no obligation other than to return subscription monies as soon as practicable.\nWe may decide, in our sole discretion and for any reason, to cancel or terminate the Rights Offering at any time prior to the expiration date. If the offering is cancelled or terminated, we will have no obligation with respect to subscription rights that have been exercised except to return as soon as practicable, without interest, the subscription payments deposited with the subscription agent. If we terminate the offering, the subscription rights will expire worthless.\nBecause we do not have any formal commitments from any of our shareholders to participate in the Rights Offering, the net proceeds we receive from the Rights Offering may not be significant.\nWe do not have any formal commitments from any of our shareholders to participate in the Rights Offering, and we cannot assure you that any of our shareholders or warrant holders will exercise all or any part of their basic subscription right or their over-subscription privilege. If our shareholders or warrantholders that may acquire subscription rights subscribe for a relatively small amount of shares of our common stock, the net proceeds we receive from the Rights Offering will not be significant.\nThe receipt of Subscription Rights may be treated as a taxable distribution.\nWe believe the distribution of the subscription rights in the Rights Offering should be a non-taxable distribution to holders of shares of common stock and our Series L warrants under Section 305(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). This position is not binding on the IRS, or the courts, however. If the Rights Offering is deemed to be part of a \u201cdisproportionate distribution\u201d under Section 305 of the Code, a holder\u2019s receipt of subscription rights in the Rights Offering may be treated as the receipt of a taxable distribution to such holder equal to the fair market value of the subscription rights. Any such distribution would be treated as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, if any, with any excess being treated as a return of capital to the extent thereof and then as capital gain. Each holder of shares of common stock and each holder of a Series L warrant is urged to consult his, her or its own tax advisor with respect to the particular tax consequences of the Rights Offering.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryovers to reduce future tax payments may be limited as a result of the Rights Offering.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for federal income tax purposes of approximately $70 million. We generally are able to carry NOLs forward to reduce taxable income in future years. These NOLs begin to expire at December 31, 2025. However, our ability to utilize the NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 382 generally restricts the use of NOLs after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the stockholders (or specified groups of stockholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, five (5%) percent or more of our common stock or are otherwise treated as five (5%) percent stockholders under Section 382 and the regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders over a three-year rolling period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of our stock on the date of the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOL carryforwards.\nThe rules of Section 382 are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Because of our numerous capital raises, which have included the issuance of various classes of convertible securities and warrants, uncertainty exists as to whether we may have undergone an ownership change in the past or will undergo one as a result of the Rights Offering. Even if the Rights Offering does not cause an ownership change, it may increase the likelihood that we may undergo an ownership change in the future. Based on our recent stock prices, we believe any ownership change would severely limit our ability to utilize the NOLs. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our NOLs will be fully available. As a result, we could pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if the NOLs were available to reduce the federal income taxes without restriction.", "PERMNO": 91471, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACER"}
