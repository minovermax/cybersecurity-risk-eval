RISK FACTORS\nA worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the Cincinnati, Ohio metropolitan area, which includes the Ohio Counties of Hamilton, Warren, Butler and Clermont. We also conduct a moderate level of business in the southeastern Indiana region, primarily in Dearborn, Ripley, Franklin and Ohio Counties, and we originate loans in the northern Kentucky region secured by properties in Campbell, Kenton and Boone Counties. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans.\nA deterioration in economic conditions could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u00b7 demand for our products and services may decline;\n\u00b7 loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u00b7 collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and\n\u00b7 the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, some of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates on more attractive terms than loans that we offer, which we expect to continue in the foreseeable future. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest earning assets. For additional information see \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition.\u201d\nBecause we intend to increase our commercial real estate and commercial business loan originations, our credit risk will increase and downturns in the real estate market or local economy could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe intend to emphasize the origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans as a strategic complement to our traditional emphasis on originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. Commercial real estate and commercial loans also may involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely impact the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans. Further, unlike residential mortgage loans or multi-family and commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may be more difficult to appraise and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at default. As our commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase. Furthermore, it may be difficult to assess the future performance of newly originated commercial loans, as such loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur business strategy includes growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOur business strategy includes growth in assets, deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market, thereby increasing our share of the market. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.\nFuture changes in interest rates may reduce our profits.\nOur ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between:\nthe interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\nthe interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many savings institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest we pay on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower interest rates.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A reduction in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. While we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, such changes can still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings.\nFor further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Market Risk.\u201d\nA continuation of the historically low interest rate environment may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nIn recent years the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policy has been to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, market interest rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased since 2008 have been lower than in prior years. Our ability to reduce our interest expense is limited at current interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. A continuation of a low interest rate environment may adversely affect our net interest income, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nThe need to account for certain assets at estimated fair value, such as loans held for sale and investment securities, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe report certain assets, such as loans held for sale and investment securities, at estimated fair value. The balance of loans held for sale was $1.9 million at December 31, 2015, while the balance of investment securities was $98.7 million at December 31, 2015. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize observable market inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our financial records at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the subject asset presents minimal credit risk. For the year ended December 31, 2015, investment securities resulted in reductions to other comprehensive income of $468,000, but we did not recognize a loss on investment securities or loans held for sale during those periods.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions or the results of our analyses are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. In addition, our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolios of commercial real estate and commercial business loans, as well as any future credit deterioration, could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future. Our allowance for loan losses was 0.94% of net loans and 47.4% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2015. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur emphasis on one- to four-family residential mortgage loans exposes us to increased credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2015, $219.3 million, or 55.8% of our total loan portfolio, was secured by one- to four-family real estate, which included $3.2 million of home equity loans and $20.1 million of home equity lines of credit. Recent economic conditions have resulted in declines in real estate values in our market areas. These declines in real estate values could cause some of our mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral or if borrowers who sell their homes are unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank, rather than for our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the regulation of banks and savings institutions and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies have been given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, many of which are not in final form. As a result, we cannot at this time predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act will impact our business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations and policies has already resulted in changes to our business and operations, as well as additional costs, and diverted management\u2019s time from other business activities, which adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nA final capital rule, effective for us on January 1, 2015, includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from prior rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. The Bank has elected to opt out of the requirement under the final rule to include certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings for calculating its regulatory capital requirements. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and, when fully phased in, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nWe have analyzed the effects of these new capital requirements, and we believe that we meet all of these new requirements, including the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer, as if it had been fully phased in.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and may require raising additional capital in the future, and result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding sources, change our business models or increase our holdings of liquid assets. The implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, changes to items included in or deducted from regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or repurchasing our shares. Specifically, beginning in 2016, the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the new capital rules, which may further limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to stockholders. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Capital Requirements.\u201d\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nOur ability to originate and sell loans could be restricted by recently adopted federal regulations.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule intended to clarify how lenders can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which holds lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage loan. Under the rule, loans that meet the \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u00b7 excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u00b7 interest-only payments;\n\u00b7 negative amortization; and\n\u00b7 terms of longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a loan must be made to a borrower whose total monthly debt-to-income ratio does not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify a borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the regulatory agencies to issue regulations that require securitizers of loans to retain \u201cnot less than 5% of the credit risk for any asset that is not a qualified residential mortgage.\u201d The regulatory agencies have issued a final rule to implement this requirement. The final rule provides that the definition of \u201cqualified residential mortgage\u201d includes loans that meet the definition of qualified mortgage issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nThese final rules could have a significant effect on the secondary market for loans and the types of loans we originate, and restrict our ability to make loans, any of which could limit our growth or profitability.\nOur success depends on hiring and retaining certain key personnel.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as loan and deposit generation, as well as operational functions such as regulatory compliance and information technology. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these functions effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could reduce our net income. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nWe face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and/or suffer damage to our reputation.\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches could adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation.\nWe regularly collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial and other transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks and mobile phishing. Mobile phishing, a means for identity thieves to obtain sensitive personal information through fraudulent e-mail, text or voice mail, is an emerging threat targeting the customers of popular financial entities. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses.\nIf this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss.\nAlthough we employ a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, and that if mishandling, misuse or loss of information does occur, those events will be promptly detected and addressed. Similarly, when confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf, our policies and procedures require that the third party agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information, establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality of the information, and permit us to confirm the third party\u2019s compliance with the terms of the agreement. As information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any systems failures, interruptions, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us or the financial services industry in general.\nWe, and other participants in the financial services industry upon whom we rely, have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we, or other participants in the financial services industry, may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial cost and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers and employees, costly litigation and increased governmental regulation, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing this annual report as well as other periodic reports we are required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our valuation of investment securities, our determination of our income tax provision and goodwill, and our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are essential to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could also be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements in material amounts.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on non-residential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.", "PERMNO": 90007, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "CHEV"}
