Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference into this report.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nOur revenues, profitability and future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on prevailing oil and natural gas prices. These prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for our capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we will be able to borrow under our credit agreement will be subject to periodic redetermination based in part on current oil and natural gas prices and on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce, resulting in an adverse effect on the quantities and the value of our reserves.\nHistorically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Among the factors that can cause volatility are:\n\u00b7\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries to agree upon and determine oil prices and production levels;\n\u00b7\nsocial unrest and political instability, particularly in major oil and natural gas producing regions outside the United States, such as northern Africa and the Middle East, and armed conflict or terrorist attacks, whether or not in oil or natural gas producing regions;\n\u00b7\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u00b7\nthe growth of consumer product demand in emerging markets, such as China;\n\u00b7\nlabor unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions, including hurricanes and other natural occurrences that affect the supply and/or demand of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u00b7\nthe price of foreign imports; and\n\u00b7\nworldwide economic conditions.\nThese external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas.\nUnless we replace our reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life of a well, particularly horizontal wells. Estimates of the decline rate of an oil or natural gas well are inherently imprecise, and are less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and natural gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories. Our production levels and the reserves that we currently expect to recover from our wells will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and results of operations are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current properties and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, our cash flow and the value of our reserves may decrease, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves involve assumptions and any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and the value of our reserves.\nThis report contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and the value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 56% of our estimated reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. The estimates of these oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves have been prepared in accordance with SEC regulations; however, actual capital expenditures will likely vary from estimated capital expenditures, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not be as estimated.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas average prices without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7\nthe actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe actual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. As a corporation, we are treated as a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes and our future income taxes will be dependent on our future taxable income. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this report which would could have a material effect on the value of our reserves.\nIf commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value for a significant period of time, then we will be required to incur write-downs of the carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nA write-down of the capitalized cost of individual oil and natural gas properties could occur when oil and natural gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, if operating costs or development costs increase over prior estimates, or if exploratory drilling is unsuccessful. A write-down could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, on a field-by-field basis, may exceed the estimated future net cash flows of that field. If so, we will record impairment charges to reduce the capitalized costs of such field to our estimate of the field\u2019s fair\nmarket value. Unproved properties are evaluated at the lower of cost or fair market value. These types of charges will reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe periodically assess our properties for impairment based on future estimates of proved and non-proved reserves, oil and natural gas prices, production rates and operating, development and reclamation costs based on operating budget forecasts. Once incurred, an impairment charge cannot be reversed at a later date even if we experience increases in the price of oil and/or natural gas or increases in the quantity of our estimated proved reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and our small size puts us at a disadvantage in competing for resources.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive. We compete with major integrated and larger independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and leases, for the equipment and services required to develop and operate properties, and in the marketing of oil and gas to end-users. Many competitors have financial and other resources that are substantially greater than ours, which will make any acquisition of acreage or producing properties at economic prices difficult. In addition, many larger competitors may be better able to respond to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changes in worldwide oil and natural gas prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. Significant competition also exists in attracting and retaining technical personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, landmen and other specialists, as well as financial and administrative personnel and we may be at a competitive disadvantage to companies with larger financial resources than ours.\nA failure to complete additional acquisitions would limit our growth.\nOur future success is highly dependent on our ability to find, acquire or develop economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves. Without continued successful acquisition, exploration or development projects, our current oil and natural gas reserves will decline due to continued production activities. Acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties, when attractive opportunities arise, is an important component of our strategy. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, management may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. Our limited access to financial resources compared to larger, better capitalized companies may limit our ability to make future acquisitions. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it will be more difficult to replace and increase our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including the risk that we will discover unanticipated liabilities or other problems associated with the acquired business or property.\nIn assessing potential acquisitions, we will consider information available in the public domain and information provided by the seller. In the event publicly available data is limited, then, by necessity, we may rely to a large extent on information that may only be available from the seller, particularly with respect to drilling and completion costs and practices, geological, geophysical and petrophysical data, detailed production data on existing wells, and other technical and cost data not available in the public domain. Accordingly, the review and evaluation of the business or property to be acquired may not uncover all existing or relevant data, obligations or actual or contingent liabilities that could adversely impact the business or property to be acquired and, hence, could adversely affect us as a result of the acquisition. These issues may be material and could include, among other things, unexpected environmental problems, title defects or other liabilities. If we acquire properties on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis, we will have limited or no remedies against the seller with respect to these types of problems.\nThe success of any acquisition that we complete will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to accurately assess the reserves associated with the acquired properties, future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors. These assessments are often inexact and subjective. As a result, we may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property or recognize an acceptable return from such sales. In addition, we may face greater risks to the extent we acquire properties in areas outside of areas in which we currently operate because we may be less familiar with operating, regulatory and other issues specific to those areas.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits that we expect from an acquisition will also depend on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired operations. Management may be required to dedicate significant time and effort to the integration process, which could divert its attention from other business concerns. The challenges involved in the integration process may include retaining key employees and maintaining employee morale, addressing differences in business cultures, processes and systems and developing internal expertise regarding the acquired properties.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations and drilling operations.\nOil and natural gas exploration, drilling and production activities are subject to numerous significant operating risks, including the possibility of:\n\u00b7\nunanticipated, abnormally pressured formations;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u00b7\nblowouts, fires and explosions;\n\u00b7\npersonal injuries and death;\n\u00b7\nuninsured or underinsured losses; and\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination.\nAny of these operating hazards could cause damage to properties, reduced cash flows, serious injuries, fatalities, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages, which could expose us to liabilities. Although we believe we are adequately insured for replacement costs of our wells and associated equipment, the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce the funds available for exploration, development, and acquisition, or could result in a loss of our properties.\nThe nature of our business and assets will expose us to significant compliance costs and liabilities.\nOur operations involving the exploration and production of hydrocarbons are subject to stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, operational safety, and related employee health and safety matters. Laws and regulations applicable to us include those relating to the following:\n\u00b7\nland use restrictions;\n\u00b7\ndelivery of our oil and natural gas to market;\n\u00b7\ndrilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements;\n\u00b7\nspacing of wells;\n\u00b7\nemissions into the air;\n\u00b7\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u00b7\nhabitat and endangered species protection, reclamation and remediation;\n\u00b7\ncontainment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials;\n\u00b7\ndrilling permits;\n\u00b7\nuse of saltwater injection wells, which affects the disposal of saltwater from our wells;\n\u00b7\nsafety precautions;\n\u00b7\nprevention of oil spills;\n\u00b7\noperational reporting; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation and royalties.\nCompliance with all of these laws and regulations are a significant cost of doing business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities; the issuance of injunctions that may restrict, inhibit or prohibit our operations; and claims of damages to property or persons.\nSome environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of prior operators of properties we acquired or of other third parties. Similarly, some environmental laws and regulations impose joint and several liability, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of a particular reclamation or other obligation, and potentially the entire obligation, where other parties were involved in the activity giving rise to the liability. In addition, we may be\nrequired to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example by installing and maintaining pollution control devices. Similarly, our plugging and abandonment obligations are and will continue to be substantial and may be more than our estimates. It is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters, but they will be material. Environmental risks are generally not fully insurable.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, natural gas venting and transportation restrictions based on crude oil volatility, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in our production of oil and natural gas and lower returns on our capital investments.\nBills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress and in various state legislatures to regulate hydraulic fracturing operations and related injection of fracturing fluids and propping agents used in fracturing fluids by the oil and natural gas industry under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) and to require the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process under the SDWA, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (\u201cEPCRA\u201d) or other authority. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of unconventional oil and natural gas wells in shale and tight sand formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us for many of the wells that we drill and operate. Sponsors of such bills have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies, surface waters, and other natural resources, and threaten health and safety. In addition, The EPA has commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, with a draft of the study anticipated to be available by March 2015, and legislation has been proposed before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process, which legislation could be reintroduced in the current session of Congress. Further, certain members of the Congress have called upon the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, the SEC to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency's estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates. Certain states and localities have also considered or imposed reporting and other operational obligations relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques.\nCertain states, including Texas, where we conduct operations, have adopted, and other states are considering the adoption of, regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Such efforts have resulted in the imposition of bans on hydraulic fracturing. Some local jurisdictions, including Dallas, Texas, have adopted regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing. The proliferation of regulations may limit our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing, which is an essential component of our current operations in the Eagle Ford trend of south Texas and in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana.\nAdditional legislation or regulation could make it easier for parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process adversely affect groundwater. There has also been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for adverse impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated in Texas and other states implicating hydraulic fracturing practices.\nLegislation, regulation, litigation and enforcement actions at the federal, state or local level that restrict hydraulic fracturing services could limit the availability and raise the cost of such services, delay completion of new wells and production of our oil and natural gas, lower our return on capital expenditures and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced.\nCertain states, including North Dakota where we conduct operations, and have interest in numerous non-operated wells, and intend to expand our presence in the future have adopted, and other states are considering the adoption of, regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure and threshold requirements on the intentional or inadvertent venting of natural gas. Such efforts have resulted in the delay of certain drilling and/or completion operations until additional natural gas pipelines are built or sufficient transportation capacity is available. The proliferation of these regulations in North Dakota and in other states may limit or delay our ability to conduct operations in a timely manner.\nThe state of North Dakota has issued new conditioning standards requiring certain crude oils produced in North Dakota to be conditioned to remove lighter, volatile hydrocarbons, and thereby make the oil safer to transport by railroad. The new standards seek to address safety concerns stemming from several recent train derailments in U.S. and Canada. The new standard establishes a goal of achieving a vapor pressure of no greater than 13.7 pounds per square inch (psi) rather than the current national standard of 14.7 psi or less. The adoption of these regulations and/or their proliferation to other states may require the installation of new and more costly\ncontrol equipment, increase the cost of production operations, increase the costs incurred by oil transporters and thereby decrease the price we receive for crude oil sold in North Dakota.\nRegulation related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for oil and natural gas.\nStudies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol address greenhouse gas emissions, and international negotiations over climate change and greenhouse gases are continuing. Meanwhile, several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory regimens.\nIn the United States, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emission targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs.\nAt the federal level, the Obama Administration is attempting to address climate change through a variety of administrative actions. The EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations that cover oil and natural gas facilities, among other industries. On July 19, 2011, the EPA amended the oil and natural gas facility greenhouse gas reporting rule to require reporting beginning in September 2012. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an \u201cEndangerment Finding\u201d under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding certain greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. In March 2014, moreover, the President released a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that included consideration of both voluntary programs and targeted regulations for the oil and gas sector. Towards that end, the EPA has released five draft white papers on methane and volatile organic compound emissions and mitigation measures for natural gas compressors, hydraulically fractured oil wells, pneumatic devices, well liquids unloading facilities and natural gas production and transmission facilities. Building on its white papers and public input on those documents, the EPA has announced that it intends to issue a proposed rule in the summer of 2015 to set standards for methane and VOC emissions from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas transmissions sources. Also as part of the President\u2019s strategy, the BLM is expected to propose standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands. The EPA and BLM actions are part of a series of steps by the Administration that are intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels.\nIn the courts, several decisions have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by governments and private parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property.\nAny laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions controls or other compliance costs, and reduce demand for our products.\nThe ongoing implementation of federal legislation enacted in 2010 could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effects of commodity prices, interest rates and other risks associated with our business.\nHistorically, we have entered into a number of commodity derivative contracts in order to hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production and, periodically, interest expense. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or CFTC), along with other federal agencies, to promulgate regulations implementing the new legislation. The CFTC, in coordination with the SEC and various U.S. federal banking regulators, has issued regulations to implement the so-called \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d under which banking entities are generally prohibited from proprietary trading of derivatives. Although conditional exemptions from this general prohibition are available, the Volcker Rule may limit the trading activities of banking entities that have been counterparties to our derivatives trades in the past. Also, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the \u201cswaps push-out rule\u201d may require some of the banking counterparties to our commodity derivative contracts to \u201cpush out\u201d some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.\nThe CFTC also has finalized other regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s provisions regarding trade reporting, margin and position limits; however, some regulations remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will adopt final rules. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFTC regulations may require compliance with margin requirements and\nwith certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with certain of our derivative activities. Also, the CFTC has re-proposed regulations setting position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions are expected to be made exempt from these limits. It is possible that the CFTC, in conjunction with the U.S. federal banking regulators, may mandate that financial counterparties entering into swap transactions with end-users must do so with credit support agreements in place, which could result in negotiated credit thresholds above which we would be required to post collateral.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any additional implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of some commodity derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral, which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of some commodity derivative contracts, limit our ability to trade some derivatives to hedge risks, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we may encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing commodity derivative contracts, and potentially increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a consequence, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. If the implementing regulations result in lower commodity prices, our revenues could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny change to government regulation or administrative practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability.\nOil and gas exploration and development is subject to substantial regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the exploration for, and the development, upgrading, marketing, pricing, taxation, and transportation of, oil and natural gas and related products and other associated matters. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of oil and gas exploration and development operations could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that income tax laws, royalty regulations and government incentive programs related to our oil and gas properties and the oil and gas industry generally will not be changed in a manner which may adversely affect our progress or cause delays.\nPermits, leases, licenses, and approvals are required from a variety of regulatory authorities at various stages of exploration and development. There can be no assurance that the various government permits, leases, licenses and approvals sought will be granted in respect of our activities or, if granted, will not be cancelled or will be renewed upon expiration. There is no assurance that such permits, leases, licenses, and approvals will not contain terms and provisions which may adversely affect our exploration and development activities.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, we have entered into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our anticipated production and we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, these transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if oil and natural gas prices, were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedges. In addition, these transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u00b7\nour production is less than expected;\n\u00b7\nthere is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production; or\n\u00b7\nthe counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon gathering systems, transportation facilities and processing facilities that we do not own or control. If these facilities or systems are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production is dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, transportation and processing facilities owned by third parties. In general, we will not control these facilities, and our access to them may be limited or denied due to circumstances beyond our control. A significant disruption in the availability of these facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market the oil and natural gas we produce and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. In some cases, our ability to deliver to market our oil and natural gas is dependent upon coordination among third parties that own transportation and processing facilities we use, and any inability or unwillingness of those parties to coordinate efficiently could also interrupt our operations. These are risks for which we generally will not maintain insurance.\nUse of debt financing may adversely affect our strategy.\nWe intend to use debt to fund a portion of our future acquisition and operating activities. Any temporary or sustained inability to service or repay debt will materially adversely affect our ability to access the financing market and to pursue our operating strategies, as well as impair our ability to respond to adverse economic changes in oil and natural gas markets and the economy in general.\nNon-operated properties will be controlled by third parties that may not allow us to proceed with planned explorations and expenditures. Activities on operated properties could also be limited or subject to penalties.\nWhile we intend to operate the majority of our properties, we are not currently the operator of many of our existing properties and, therefore, may not be able to influence production operations or further development activities. At present, we operate wells comprising approximately 64% of our total proved reserves. Joint ownership is customary in the oil and gas industry and is generally conducted under the terms of a Joint Operating Agreement (\u201cJOA\u201d), where one of the working interest owners is designated as the \u201coperator\u201d of the property. For non-operated properties, subject to the specific terms and conditions of the applicable JOA, if we disagree with the decision of a majority of working interest owners, we may be required, among other things, to postpone the proposed activity or decline to participate. If we decline to participate, we might be forced to relinquish our interest through \u201cin-or-out\u201d elections or may be subject to certain non-consent penalties, as provided in a JOA. In-or-out elections may require a joint owner to participate or forever relinquish its position, typically only in specific wells or drilling units, although such relinquished positions could be of a larger scope. Non-consent penalties typically allow participating working interest owners to recover from the proceeds of production, if any, an amount equal to 200% to 500% of the non-participating working interest owner\u2019s share of the cost of such operations. Further, even for properties operated by us, there may be instances where decisions related to drilling, completion and operating cannot be made in our sole discretion. In such instances, we could be limited in our development operations and subject to penalties as specified above if we choose not to participate in operations proposed by a majority of working interest owners.\nBecause we cannot control activities on properties we do not operate, we cannot control the timing of exploration and development projects. If we are unable to fund required capital expenditures with respect to non-operated properties, our interests in those properties may be reduced or forfeited.\nOur ability to exercise influence over operations and costs for the properties we do not operate is limited. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital with respect to exploration, exploitation, development or acquisition activities. The success and timing of exploration, exploitation and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that may be outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\nthe approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u00b7\nthe selection of technology.\nWhere we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular oil and natural gas project, we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the project. If we are not willing or able to fund required capital expenditures relating to a project when required by the majority owner(s) or operator, our interests in the project may be reduced or forfeited. Also, we could be responsible for plugging and abandonment and other liabilities in excess of our proportionate interest in the property.\nBecause we cannot control the timing and accuracy of financial information regarding the results of operations on properties we do not operate, our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.\nFor properties we do not operate, we are dependent on the operators of such properties for financial information regarding the results of operations. Any delay in receipt of such information or inaccuracies in calculating and reporting such information by the operator would adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and financial condition.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserve estimation, for compliance report.\nWe are dependent on digital technologies including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees, business partners, and stockholder, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct oil and natural gas exploration and development activities make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, also has increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period of time. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE MKT rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nOVR beneficially owns a majority of our common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE MKT corporate governance standards. Under the NYSE MKT rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE MKT corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u00b7\na majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u00b7\nwe have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u00b7\nwe have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nWe are currently utilizing, and intend to continue to utilize, the exemption relating to a majority of our board of directors not being independent, the compensation committee, the nominating committee, and we may utilize this exemption for so long as we are a controlled company. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE MKT.\nOVR holds a substantial majority of our common stock.\nOVR holds the majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. OVR is entitled to act separately in its own interest with respect to its shares of our common stock, and it has the voting power to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs. In addition, OVR has the ability to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of our company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company. The existence of a significant stockholder may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company.\nSo long as OVR continues to control a significant amount of our common stock, OVR will continue to be able to strongly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that a potential transaction is in their own best interests. In any of these matters, the interests of OVR may differ or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder.\nOur common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of drilling and rig activity, economic conditions in the natural gas and oil industry, general economic conditions or other events or factors that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for oil and natural gas exploration companies, in particular, have experienced large price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results or asset values of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been instituted against certain oil and natural gas exploration companies. If this type of litigation were instituted against us following a period of volatility in our common stock trading price, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17073, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ESTE"}
