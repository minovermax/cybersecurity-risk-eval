{"cik": "828146", "company": "INTERLINK ELECTRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nIf we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological change and gain market acceptance of new products, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nTechnology, both in our markets and in our customers\u2019 markets, is undergoing rapid change. In order to maintain our leadership position in our existing markets and to emerge as a leader in new markets, we will have to maintain a leadership position in the technologies supporting those markets. Doing so will require, among other things, that we accomplish the following:\n\u00b7\naccurately predict the evolving needs of our customers and develop, in a timely manner, the technology required to support those needs;\n\u00b7\nprovide products that are not only technologically sophisticated and well supported but are also available at a price within market tolerances and competitive with comparable products;\n\u00b7\nestablish and effectively defend our ownership on the intellectual property supporting our products; and\n\u00b7\nenter into relationships with other companies that have developed complementary technology on which our products also depend.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve any of these objectives.\nIf we fail to manage change successfully, our operations could be adversely impacted and our business could be impaired.\nThe ability to operate our business in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process. We expect that responding to changes in our business will place a significant strain on our personnel, management systems, infrastructure and other resources. Our ability to manage change effectively will require us to attract, train, motivate and manage new employees, to reallocate human and other resources to support new undertakings and to restructure our operations to manage a restructured business effectively. If we are unable to respond effectively to change, our operations could be adversely affected and our business could be impaired.\nWe rely on third parties for the materials that we use to manufacture our products and a shortage of supply could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and customer relationships.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the raw material components of our products. We cannot assure you that our suppliers will be able to maintain an adequate supply of these raw materials to enable us to fulfill all of our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis. A failure to obtain an adequate supply of the materials for our products could increase our costs of goods sold, cause us to fail to meet delivery commitments and cause our customers to purchase from our competitors, which could adversely affect our operating results and customer relationships. In some situations, we rely on a single\nsupplier for raw material components of our products. Any disruption in these supplier relationships could prevent us from maintaining an adequate supply of materials and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial position.\nDisruptions in our manufacturing facilities or arrangements could cause our revenues and operating results to decline.\nWe currently manufacture the majority of our products in Shenzhen, China. This facility is vulnerable to damage from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss and similar events. It could also be subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism. Our insurance may not cover such events and, if the event is covered, our insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for any losses that may occur. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our manufacturing facility could result in delayed shipment of products, missed delivery deadlines and harm to our reputation, which may cause our revenues and operating results to decline. Performance, reliability or quality problems with our products may cause our customers to reduce or cancel orders which would harm our operating results.\nWe regularly introduce new products with new technologies or manufacturing processes. Our products have in the past contained, and may in the future contain, errors or defects that may be detected at any point in the life of the product. Detection of such errors could result in delays in shipping and sales during the period required to correct such errors. Defects may also result in product returns, loss of sales and cancelled orders, delays in market acceptance, injury to our reputation, injury to customer relationships and increased warranty costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nInternational sales and manufacturing risks could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 43% and 40% of net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe that international sales will represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. The majority of our manufacturing is currently performed in China. Our international operations involve a number of risks, including with respect to:\n\u00b7\nimport-export license agreements, tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nstaffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nsecuring credit and funding;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining an effective system of internal controls at our foreign manufacturing facility;\n\u00b7\ncollecting foreign receivables;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability, and terrorism; and\n\u00b7\ntransportation risks.\nAny of the above factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur markets are intensely competitive and many of our potential competitors have resources that we lack.\nOur markets are competitive and we expect competition in our newer markets to increase. Our competitors include companies with similar products or technologies, companies that sell complementary products to our target markets and our customers themselves, who could choose to manufacture products that they currently buy from us. Our competitors and potential competitors may have established business relationships that afford them a competitive advantage or may create technologies that are superior to ours or that set a new industry standard that will define the successful product for that market. If any of our competitors establish a close working relationship with our customers, they may obtain advance knowledge of our customers\u2019 technology choices or may be afforded an opportunity to work in partnership to develop compatible technologies and may therefore achieve a competitive advantage. We may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nWe cannot guarantee that our HMI solutions for new markets will be successful or that we will be able to continue to generate significant revenue from these markets.\nOur HMI solutions may not be successful in new markets despite the fact that these product solutions are capable of enabling people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of electronic devices. Various target markets for our interface solutions may develop slower than anticipated or could utilize competing technologies. The markets for certain of these products depend in part upon the continued development and deployment of wireless and other technologies, which may or may not address the needs of the users of these products.\nOur ability to generate significant revenue from new markets will depend on various factors, including the following: the development and growth of these markets\u037e the ability of our technologies and product solutions to address the needs of these markets; the price and performance requirements of our customers and the preferences of end users\u037e and our ability to provide our customers with HMI solutions that provide advantages in terms of size, power consumption, reliability, durability, performance, and value-added features compared with alternative solutions.\nThe failure of any of these target markets to develop as we expect, or our failure to serve these markets to a significant extent, will impede our sales growth and could result in substantially reduced earnings. We cannot predict the size or growth rate of these markets or the market share we will achieve or maintain in these markets in the future.\nIf we fail to maintain and build relationships with our customers, or if our customers\u2019 products which utilize our human-machine interface solutions do not gain widespread market acceptance, our revenue may stagnate or decline.\nWe do not sell products to end users and we do not control or influence the manufacture, promotion, distribution, or pricing of the products that incorporate our HMI solutions. Instead, we sell component products that our customers incorporate into their products, and we depend on our customers to successfully manufacture and distribute products incorporating our component products and to generate consumer demand through marketing and promotional activities. As a result of this, our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our customers\u2019 products that incorporate our HMI solutions. Even if our technologies successfully meet our customers\u2019 price and performance goals, our sales would decline or fail to develop if our customers do not achieve commercial success in selling their products that incorporate our HMI solutions.\nOur customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead, to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay at any time. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative HMI solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals. If we are unable to achieve these goals for any reason, our sales may decline or fail to develop, which would result in decreasing revenue.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that current environmental laws and product quality specification standards, or any laws or standards enacted in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and various other regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Regulations have been enacted in certain jurisdictions which impose restrictions on waste disposal of electronic products and electronics recycling obligations. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations in connection with the use and disposal of such substances or other environmental or recycling legislation, we could be subject to significant liability or loss of future sales.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property or if we infringe on the intellectual property of others, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe consider our intellectual property to be a key element of our ability to compete in our chosen markets. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and proprietary software to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. There is no assurance that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. We also cannot assure that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted will provide proprietary protection. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of the final outcome of the litigation.\nWe are not currently engaged in any patent infringement suits. Despite our efforts to maintain and safeguard our proprietary rights, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so or that our competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. If any of the holders of these patents assert claims that we are infringing them, we could be forced to incur substantial litigation expenses, and if we were found to be infringing on someone else\u2019s patent, we could be required to pay substantial damages, pay royalties in the future or be enjoined from infringing in the future.\nWe face risks associated with security breaches or cyber attacks.\nWe face risks associated with security breaches or cyber attacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers. Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following: expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber attack; liability for stolen assets or information; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; and damage to our reputation. In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyber attack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us. As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we were to lose the services of key personnel, or if we are unable to recruit qualified managers and key personnel in the future.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued availability of our key management and technical personnel. Several of our key management personnel have been with us throughout most of our history and have substantial experience with our business and technology. If one or more of our key management personnel leaves Interlink and we\nare unable to find a replacement with the combination of skills and attributes necessary to execute our business plan, it may have an adverse impact on our business. Our success will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified professional, technical, production, managerial and marketing personnel, both domestically and internationally.\nRisks Relating to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe have applied to list our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. If our listing is approved, and we subsequently fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities could be delisted.\nWe expect that our common stock will be eligible to be quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market. For our common stock to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we must meet the current NASDAQ Capital Market listing requirements. If we are unable to meet these requirements in the future, our common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market. If our common stock were to be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock could continue to trade \u201cover-the-counter\u201d following such delisting. Any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and the reduction in our coverage by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, delisting could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock.\nSteven N. Bronson, our Chairman, President and CEO, beneficially owns approximately 71% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2015. As a result, Mr. Bronson has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, Mr. Bronson has the ability to control the management and affairs of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and his ability to control the election of our directors. As a board member and officer, Mr. Bronson owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Bronson may have interests that differ from other stockholders and he may vote in a manner that is adverse to their interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of deterring, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur success depends in part on our CEO, who simultaneously leads other public corporations.\nSteven N. Bronson, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, simultaneously serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Qualstar Corporation (NASDAQ: QBAK) and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of BKF Capital Group, Inc. (OTCMKTS: BKFG). As a result, he divides his time among these companies and does not devote his full business time and attention to Interlink\u2019s business. Mr. Bronson currently works on average approximately 30 to 40 hours per week for Interlink. There can be no assurance, however, that the amount of time Mr. Bronson devotes to our company will not diminish from time to time for limited or extended periods as his other business obligations require a greater portion of his attention. Mr. Bronson is not required to spend a minimum amount of time on Interlink business. Our continued success depends in part upon the availability and performance of Mr. Bronson, who possesses unique and extensive industry knowledge and experience as well as a deep understanding of our business and strategy. A reduction in Mr. Bronson\u2019s services to Interlink from their current levels due to his obligations to Qualstar, BKF Capital or other organizations with which he is affiliated could have a disruptive effect, adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and the value of your investment could decline.\nTechnology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause investors to lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u00b7\nannouncements of new offerings, products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u00b7\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nfailure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u00b7\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u00b7\nlockup releases, sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u00b7\ndepartures of key employees; or\n\u00b7\nan adverse impact on the company from any of the other risks cited herein.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market, in general, experience a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates on unfavorable terms to us.\nWe may seek additional capital through a variety of means, including through private and public equity offerings and debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect\nstockholder rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds from third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts for our product candidates, or we may need to grant to others the rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and will be required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the securities exchange on which our common stock is traded and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and results of operations. We may need to hire additional employees to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, we also expect that being a public company and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nWe will be required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting when we file our December 31, 2016 annual report with the SEC. Such report will contain, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our business prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, consequently, stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. As a result, stockholders may only receive a return on their investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nOur charter documents and Nevada law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u00b7\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, by majority vote, or by any shareholder or group of shareholders who own and have the right to vote more than 25% of our issued and outstanding securities, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt.\nWe also are subject to provisions of Nevada law found in Nevada Revised Statutes, Sections 78.411 to 78.444, inclusive, that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns 10 percent or more of our stock, cannot acquire us for a period of time after the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors and stockholders.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur failure to comply with U.S. laws and regulations relating to the export and import of goods, technology, and software could subject us to penalties and other sanctions and restrict our ability to license and develop our circuit designs.\nWe are obligated by law to comply with all U.S. laws and regulations governing the export and import of goods, technology, and services, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, regulations administered by the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and regulations administered by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives governing the importation of items on the U.S. Munitions Import List. Pursuant to these regulations, we are responsible for determining the proper licensing jurisdiction and export classification of our products, and obtaining all necessary licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports and imports of technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance or other defense services to or on behalf of foreign persons. We are also required to obtain export licenses, if required, before employing or otherwise utilizing foreign persons in the performance of our contracts if the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software. The violation of any of the applicable laws and regulations could subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.\nThese regulations could restrict our ability to sell products and develop new products. For example, as a result of ITAR requirements, we are unable to supply certain products to China satellite companies or end users, which comprise a significant part of the overall satellite market. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying products incorporating our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of products that include our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or our ability to export or license our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations and decreased revenue. Additionally, failure to comply with these laws could result in sanctions by the U.S. government, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges, and debarment from government contracts.\nIf we fail to comply with anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.\nAs a result of our international operations, we may be subject to anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA, which prohibits companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. If we fail to comply with these laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or other U.S. or foreign governmental authorities could seek civil and/or criminal sanctions, including monetary fines and penalties against us or our employees, as well as additional changes to our business practices and compliance programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 79280, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "LINK"}
