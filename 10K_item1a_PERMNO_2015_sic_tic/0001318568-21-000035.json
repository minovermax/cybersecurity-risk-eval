{"cik": "1318568", "company": "Everi Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following section describes material risks and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or the market price of our stock. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. This section should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOverall\n\u2022The global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to or in the future have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in the gaming industry that we serve. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position, and the achievement of our business objectives.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, with particular impact to the gaming industry, disrupted global supply chains, temporarily lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets, and increased unemployment levels. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses, including those of our casino customers, and resulted in the institution of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements in many states, countries, and communities in which we operate. Consequently, demand for our products and services continues to be significantly impacted, which adversely affects our revenue and profitability. Furthermore, the pandemic could impair our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity, particularly if certain casinos and other gaming businesses remain closed or, when they reopen, social distancing and other COVID-19 protective measures or a lack of consumer confidence in the gaming industry prevent them from opening at full capacity, the impact on the global economy worsens and impacts the disposable income available to our casino customers\u2019 patrons, or customers continue to delay making payments to us under existing obligations. Additionally, after reopening, a resurgence of COVID-19 could cause federal, state, tribal, and municipal governments and regulatory agencies to close casinos or impose other restrictions. Some casinos have voluntarily closed in response to COVID-19 cases among guests or resurgences in the areas in which they operate and may do so again in the future. Similarly, because of changing economic and market conditions affecting the gaming industry, our ability to achieve our business objectives has been impacted. As a result of the financial difficulties facing casino operators due to the pandemic, many of our customers have requested, that we offer our products and our services for less than we did prior to the pandemic, particularly as it relates to our recurring revenue products and the tolling of service fees during the pendency of their closures, which relief we have granted in certain circumstances. Our business operations have also been disrupted as significant portions of our workforce have been working from home, including to protect personal health and safety, and because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions imposed in connection with the pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we furloughed a majority our employees and reduced employee salaries through most of the second and third quarters of 2020, borrowed and repaid funds under existing and new credit facilities, adopted certain relief measures provided by the CARES Act and may seek additional funding, to the extent available, under the CARES Act or other new federal or state programs. In addition, we suspended share repurchases, as required under our existing and new credit facilities, and may take other capital actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, we canceled or delayed material capital expenditures and, as a result, we will not have the benefit of those investments to help our operations and financial performance in the future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Further, as a result of the inherent uncertainty of our expectations and assumptions regarding business plans, results of operations, and financial condition, any of which may prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges, among other items, in future periods, whether in connection with our normal review procedures periodically, or earlier, if an indicator of an impairment is present prior to such evaluation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate the risks disclosed in this section of our Annual Report, including, but not limited to: our ability to comply with the terms of our indebtedness, our ability to generate revenues, earn profits and maintain adequate liquidity, our ability to service existing and attract new customers, maintain our overall competitiveness in the market, the potential for significant fluctuations in demand for our services, overall trends in the\ngaming industry impacting our business, as well as potential volatility in our stock price, among other consequences such as cybersecurity exposure.\n\u2022If we are unable to develop and protect our intellectual property adequately or obtain intellectual property rights and agreements, we may lose valuable competitive advantages, be forced to incur costly litigation to protect our rights, or be restricted in our ability to provide various products in our markets.\nOur success depends, in part, on developing and protecting our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on other confidentiality and contractual agreements and arrangements with our employees, affiliates, business partners, and customers to establish and protect our intellectual property and similar proprietary rights. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in protecting these rights and, despite our efforts, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how could become known to, or independently developed by, competitors through malfeasance by employees, contractors or other insiders who may have access to our intellectual property; industrial, corporate or other espionage events; unauthorized intrusions into our networks or those of our third-party vendors. Any litigation relating to the defense of our intellectual property, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and potentially cause a diversion of our resources.\nIn addition, we rely on intellectual property licenses from one or more third-party competitors, the loss of which could materially and adversely affect our business and the sale or placement of our products. Various third-party gaming manufacturers with which we compete are much larger than us and have substantially larger intellectual property assets. The gaming manufacturer industry is very competitive and litigious, and a lawsuit brought by one of our larger competitors, whether or not well-founded, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows and our ability to sell or place our products.\nIn addition, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to our business operations. In the event a claim of infringement against us is successful, we may be required to pay royalties to use technology or other intellectual property rights that we had been using, or we may be required to enter into a license agreement and pay license fees, or we may be required to stop using the technology or other intellectual property rights that we had been using. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable amount of time. Any litigation of this type, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and potentially cause a diversion of our resources.\n\u2022We rely on technology provided by third-party vendors, the loss of which could materially and adversely affect our business, increase our costs, and delay deployment or suspend development of our financial services products, gaming systems, and player terminals.\nWe have entered into license agreements with third parties for the exclusive use of their technology and intellectual property rights in the gaming industry, such as our license to use portions of the software infrastructure upon which our cash access systems operate, and we also rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our gaming devices, fully integrated kiosks, and other integrated kiosk solutions. We rely on these other parties to maintain and protect this technology and the related intellectual property rights. If our licensors fail to protect their intellectual property rights in material that we license and we are unable to protect such intellectual property rights, the value of our licenses may diminish significantly, and our business could be significantly harmed. In addition, if these agreements expire and we are unable to renew them, or if the manufacturers of this software or hardware, or functional equivalents of this software or hardware, were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms, we may lose a valuable competitive advantage and our business could be harmed.\nTo the extent there are adverse conditions present, we may experience various difficulties, particularly with respect to international third-party suppliers of our components, that could cause significant production delays. If we are unable to obtain these components from our established third-party vendors, we could be required to either redesign our products to function with alternate third-party products or to develop or manufacture these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in the deployment of our gaming systems and player terminals. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future offerings.\n\u2022Our net operating losses and other tax credit carry-forwards are subject to limitations that could potentially reduce these tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had tax effected federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carry-forwards of approximately $95.2 million and $14.8 million, respectively, and federal research and development credit carry-forwards of approximately $12.4 million. The federal net operating losses can be carried forward and applied to offset taxable income for 20 years and will expire starting in 2025 (for losses incurred before 2018). Estimated federal losses incurred after 2017 of approximately $20.0 million, tax effected, can be carried forward indefinitely to offset taxable income. The state net operating loss carry-forwards will expire between 2021 and 2040. The federal research and development credits are limited to a 20 year carry-forward period and will begin to expire in varying amounts in 2029, if not utilized.\nBased on the weight of available evidence, including both positive and negative indicators, if it is more likely than not that a portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we must consider recording a valuation allowance. Greater weight is given to evidence that is objectively verifiable, most notably historical results. We are in a cumulative loss position and we have increased our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to these NOL and other tax credit carry-forwards, excluding the federal NOLs incurred after 2017, by approximately $17.2 million during 2020. Our ability to utilize the remaining NOL and other tax credit carry-forwards to reduce taxable income in future years may be further limited, including the possibility that projected future taxable income is insufficient to realize the benefit of these NOL carry-forwards prior to their expiration. To the extent our results of operations do not improve, we may not have the ability to overcome the more likely than not accounting standard that would allow us to reverse the valuation allowance and may be subject to record an additional valuation allowance in the future.\nIn addition, our ability to use these tax assets could be adversely affected by the limitations of Sections 382, 383 and 384 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, a portion of our NOL\u2019s include amortization of goodwill for tax purposes associated with a restructuring that occurred in 2004, which is subject to audit by the IRS and thus may have an adverse effect on our NOL carry-forwards.\n\u2022We operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters, public health issues, political instability and other potentially catastrophic events. Any interruption to our business resulting from such an event will adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIn the event of a natural or man-made disaster or other catastrophic event, the operations of gaming establishments could be negatively impacted or consumer demand for gaming could decline, or both, and as a result, our business could be interrupted, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Adverse weather conditions, particularly flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, heavy snowfall, and other extreme weather conditions often deter our customer\u2019s patrons from traveling to or make it difficult for them to frequent the sites where our games and FinTech equipment are installed. Similarly, public health crises, such as the outbreak of communicable diseases like the coronavirus, often deter patrons from visiting our customer\u2019s gaming establishments. If any of those sites, where a significant number of our games and FinTech equipment is installed, either individually or simultaneously experienced adverse weather conditions, our results of business, financial condition, and operations could be materially and adversely affected. From time to time, the impact of weather-related natural disasters has resulted in business disruption at certain of our locations as well as our customers\u2019 facilities and may do so in the future.\nSimilarly, many of the international third-party suppliers we rely on for the manufacture of our gaming and FinTech equipment are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, public health issues, political instability and other potentially catastrophic events. When these events occur, our suppliers may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us, which could result in disruptions to our supply chain that adversely affect our results of business, financial condition, and operations.\n\u2022Our business is dependent upon consumer demand for gaming and overall economic trends specific to the gaming industry. Economic downturns or a decline in the popularity of gaming could reduce the number of patrons that use our products and services or the amounts of cash that they access using our services.\nWe provide our gaming-related and cash access products and services almost exclusively to regulated gaming establishments. As a result, our business depends on consumer demand for gaming. Gaming is a discretionary leisure activity, participation in which has in the past and may in the future decline during periods of (i) economic growth, due to changes in consumers\u2019 spending preferences; (ii) economic downturns, due to decreases in our consumers\u2019 disposable income or general tourism activities; and (iii) declining consumer confidence, due to general economic conditions, domestic- and geo-political concerns, or other factors. Gaming competes with other leisure activities as a form of consumer entertainment and may lose popularity as new leisure activities arise or as other leisure activities become more popular. In addition, gaming in traditional gaming establishments (to which we sell our products and services) competes\nwith Internet-based gaming. The popularity and acceptance of gaming is also influenced by the prevailing social mores and changes in social mores, including changes driven by social responsibility organizations that are dedicated to addressing problem gaming, which could result in reduced acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity or litigation or lobbying efforts focused on limiting gaming activities. To the extent that the popularity or availability of gaming in traditional gaming establishments declines as a result of any of these factors, the demand for our cash access and gaming-related products and services, or the willingness of our customers to spend new capital on acquiring gaming equipment or utilize revenue share agreements, may decline and our business may be harmed.\nGames Business\n\u2022Most of our leased gaming device contracts with our customers are short-term, and if we are unable to maintain our current customers on terms that are favorable to us, our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows may suffer a material adverse effect.\nMost of our leased gaming device contracts with our customers are generally short-term, except for customers with whom we have entered into development and placement fee agreements. We do not rely upon the stated term of our gaming device contracts to retain the business of our customers. We rely instead upon providing competitive player terminals, games, and systems to give our customers the incentive to continue doing business with us. At any point in time, a significant portion of our gaming device business is subject to non-renewal, which may materially and adversely affect our earnings, financial condition, and cash flows. To renew or extend any of our customer contracts, generally, we may be required to accept financial and other terms that are less favorable to us than the terms of the expired contracts. In addition, we may not succeed in renewing customer contracts when they expire. If we are required to agree to other less favorable terms to retain our customers or we are not able to renew our relationships with our customers upon the expiration of our contracts, our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows could suffer a material adverse effect.\n\u2022Tribal gaming customers who have historically operated large quantities of Class II gaming units may negotiate into arrangements with state governments or renegotiate existing gaming compacts that could impact the amount of Class II gaming devices currently supplied by the Company. If we are unable to maintain our existing placement of units, then our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows may suffer an adverse effect.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we operated more than 9,200 Class II gaming units under lease or daily fixed-fee arrangements to our customers. Customers who enter into compacts with state governments may desire to change from Class II gaming units to Class III gaming units, as Class III units generally perform better than Class II units. This may result in the loss of placements under lease or daily fixed-fee arrangements as customers purchase or lease Class III units from other equipment suppliers to replace our existing Class II units. If we are unable to replace these lost units with our proprietary Class III units, then our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows may suffer an adverse effect.\n\u2022Tribal gaming customers which operate Class III gaming units do so under compact arrangements with state governments. If these tribal gaming customers are unable to maintain or renew these existing gaming compacts, then our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows may suffer an adverse effect.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we operated nearly 6,500 Class III gaming units under lease or daily fixed-fee arrangements to our tribal gaming customers. As Class III units generally perform better than Class II units, the loss of these Class III placements under lease or daily fixed-fee arrangements, if these customers are unable to renew their Class III gaming compacts and we are unable to replace these lost units with our proprietary Class II units, then our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows may be negatively impacted.\n\u2022We derive a significant portion of our revenue from Native American tribal customers, and our ability to effectively operate in Native American gaming markets is vulnerable to legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the ability to enforce contractual rights on Native American land.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our revenue from the provision of cash access and gaming-related products and services to gaming facilities operated on Native American lands. Native American tribes that are federally-recognized are considered \u201cdomestic dependent nations\u201d with certain sovereign rights and, in the absence of a specific grant of authority by Congress to a state or a specific compact or agreement between a tribal entity and a state that would allow the state to regulate activities taking place on Native American lands, such tribes can enact their own laws and regulate gaming operations and contracts. In this capacity, Native American tribes generally enjoy a degree of sovereign immunity, which, among other things, recognizes a tribe\u2019s inherent authority of self-determination and self-governance, immunizes the tribe from certain lawsuits outside of tribal jurisdiction, and generally authorizes a tribe\u2019s powers of taxation and spending over its federally-recognized nation. Accordingly, before we can seek to enforce contract rights with a Native\nAmerican tribe, or an agency or instrumentality of a Native American tribe, we must obtain from the Native American tribe a general or limited waiver of its sovereign immunity with respect to the matter in dispute, which we are not always able to do. Without a general or limited waiver of sovereign immunity, or if such waiver is held to be ineffective, we could be precluded from judicially enforcing any rights or remedies against a Native American tribe, including the right to enter Native American lands to retrieve our property in the event of a breach of contract by the tribal party to that contract. Governing law and venue provisions in our contracts with Native American tribal customers vary widely and may not be enforceable.\nGovernment enforcement, regulatory action, judicial decisions, and proposed legislative action have in the past, and will likely continue to affect our business, financial condition, operations, cash flows, and prospects in Native American tribal lands. The legal and regulatory uncertainties surrounding our Native American tribal agreements could result in a significant and immediate material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows. For example, certain of our agreements with Native American tribes are subject to review by regulatory authorities. Additionally, such uncertainties could increase our cost of doing business and could take management\u2019s attention away from operations. Regulatory action against our customers or equipment in these or other markets could result in machine seizures and significant revenue disruptions, among other adverse consequences. Moreover, Native American tribal policies and procedures, as well as tribal selection of gaming vendors, are subject to the political and governance environment within each Native American tribe. Changes in tribal leadership or tribal political pressure can affect our business relationships within Native American markets.\n\u2022We may not realize sufficient returns or be successful in renewing our existing or future placement and development fee arrangements with casino operators to expand or develop gaming facilities.\nIn our gaming business, we enter into placement fee agreements typically to secure a long-term revenue share percentage and a fixed number of player terminal placements in the gaming facility. These placement fee arrangements sometimes provide for the removal of our player terminal placements in the event of poor game performance with no further obligation of the gaming customer. Additionally, we have historically entered into development fee arrangements and may continue to do so in the future.\nFinTech Business\n\u2022An unexpectedly high level of chargebacks, as a result of fraud or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our cash access business.\nWhen patrons use our cash access services, we either dispense cash or produce a negotiable instrument that can be exchanged for cash. If a completed cash access transaction is subsequently disputed, and if we are unsuccessful in establishing the validity of the transaction, we may not be able to collect payment for such transaction and such transaction becomes a chargeback. In the event that we incur chargebacks in excess of specified levels, we could lose our sponsorship into the card associations or be censured by the card associations by way of fines or otherwise. Our failure to adequately manage our chargebacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022Changes in consumer willingness to pay a convenience fee to access their funds could reduce the demand for our cash access products and services.\nOur cash access business depends upon the willingness of patrons to pay a convenience fee to access their own funds on the premises of a gaming establishment. In most retail environments, consumers typically do not pay an additional fee for using non-cash payment methods such as credit cards, POS debit cards, or checks. Gaming patrons could bring more cash with them to gaming establishments or access cash outside of gaming establishments without paying a fee for the convenience of not having to leave the gaming establishment. To the extent that gaming patrons become unwilling to pay these convenience fees or lower cost cash access alternatives become available, the demand for cash access services within gaming establishments will decline and our business could suffer.\n\u2022We maintain a significant amount of cash within our ATMs, which is subject to potential loss due to theft or other events, including natural disasters.\nA loss of cash from our ATMs is generally our responsibility. We typically require that our service providers, who either transport the cash or otherwise have access to the ATM safe, maintain adequate insurance coverage in the event cash losses occur as a result of theft, misconduct or negligence on the part of such providers. Cash losses at the ATM could occur in a variety of ways, such as natural disaster (hurricanes, floods, etc.), fires, vandalism, and theft. While we maintain insurance policies to cover a significant portion of any losses that may occur that are not covered by the\ninsurance policies maintained by our service providers, such insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of those losses. An increase in the frequency and/or amounts of theft and other losses could negatively impact our operating results by causing higher deductible payments and increased insurance premiums.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\n\u2022Our substantial leverage could have significant adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was approximately $1.1 billion, which included the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2017 Unsecured Notes (as discussed and defined in \u201cNote 12 - Long Term Debt\u201d), each of which contain restrictive covenants. Our high degree of leverage could impact our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in our industry or the economy, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt, and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, any of which could have significant adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities and the 2017 Unsecured Notes (defined herein), and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flow in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings, including those under the Credit Facilities, will be available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\n\u2022The agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the 2017 Unsecured Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability, among other considerations, to: incur additional indebtedness; sell assets, or consolidate, or merge with or into other companies; pay dividends, or repurchase or redeem capital stock; make certain investments; issue capital stock of our subsidiaries; incur liens; prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; and enter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates. These covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.\nIn addition, to the extent we are found in default and if our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe Credit Facilities bear interest at our option of a base rate or LIBOR. We have historically elected to pay interest based on LIBOR, and our indebtedness in the future may also use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR has been, and continues to be, the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but if LIBOR is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, it could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology\n\u2022We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future network or system failures, or service interruptions, including cybersecurity attacks, or other technology and privacy risks. Our inability to protect our systems and data against such risks could harm our business and reputation.\nOur ability to provide uninterrupted and high levels of services depends upon the performance of our internal network, systems and related infrastructure, and those of our third-party vendors. Any significant interruptions in, or degradation of, the quality of the services, including infrastructure storage and support, that these third parties provide to us could severely harm our business and reputation and lead to the loss of customers and revenue. Our internal network, systems,\nand related infrastructure, in addition to the networks, systems, and related infrastructure of our third-party technology vendors, may be vulnerable to computer viruses and other malware that infiltrate such systems and networks, as well as physical or electronic security breaches, natural disasters, and similar disruptions. They have been and may continue to be the target of attempts to identify and exploit network and system vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass security measures in order to interrupt or degrade the quality of the services we receive or provide, or otherwise gain unauthorized access to our networks and systems or those of our third-party vendors. These vulnerabilities or other attempts at access may result from, or be caused by, human error or technology failures, however, they may also be the product of malicious actions by third parties intending to harm our business. The methods that may be used by these third parties to cause service interruptions or failures or to obtain unauthorized access to information change frequently, are difficult to detect, evolve rapidly, and are increasingly sophisticated and hard to defend against. Although we have not incurred material losses or liabilities as a result of security breaches or attempted security breaches and continue to invest in security measures, we cannot be certain that our defensive measures, and those employed by our third-party vendors, will be sufficient to defend against all such current and future methods.\nOur careful vetting of third parties to provide technology services and the contractual requirements related to the security that we impose on our third-party vendors who have access to this data may not be sufficient to protect us from network or system failures or service interruptions.\nAny actual or perceived security breach, whether experienced by us or a third-party vendor; the reporting or announcement of such an event, or reports of perceived security vulnerabilities of our systems or the systems of our third-party service providers whether accurate or not; or our failure or perceived failure to respond or remediate an event or make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, Gaming Authorities, regulatory or law enforcement agencies following any such event may be material and lead to harm to our financial condition, business reputation, and prospects of future business due to, among other factors: loss of customer confidence arising from interruptions or outages of our services, delays, failure to meet contractual obligations, and loss of data or public release of confidential data; increase regulatory scrutiny on us; compromise our trade secret and intellectual property; expose us to costly uninsured liabilities such as material fines, penalties, liquidated damages, and overall margin compression due to renegotiation of contracts on less favorable terms or loss of business; liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information in violation of contractual obligations or data privacy laws; and potential theft of our intellectual property.\nA security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a security breach could take a substantial amount of time, and during such time we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of such a breach. Further, detecting and remediating such incidents may require specialized expertise and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or hire individuals who possess, or otherwise internally develop, such expertise. Our remediation efforts therefore may not be successful. The inability to implement, maintain, and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there could be public announcements regarding any data security-related incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents.\nThe occurrence of any such failure may also subject us to costly lawsuits, claims for contractual indemnities, and negatively impact the status of our gaming regulatory licenses up to and including revocation, as well as divert valuable management, engineering, information technology, and marketing resources toward addressing these issues and delay our ability to achieve our strategic initiatives. In the event our EGMs or cash access products, systems, or networks are compromised, gaming establishments may require us to remediate any abnormality, downtime, loss of use, or suspicious activity, or require us to indemnify casino operators for lost business and, potentially, their patrons. In addition, we gather, as permitted by law, non-public, personally-identifiable financial information from patrons who use our cash access services, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, bank and credit card account numbers and financial transaction information, and the compromise of such data, which may subject us to fines and other related costs of remediation.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable, prudent and adequate for the purpose of our business, it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from security breaches, cyberattacks and other types of unlawful activity, or any resulting disruptions from such events. We cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Competition\n\u2022The gaming industry is intensely competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be negatively impacted.\nThe market for gaming devices, cash access products, and related services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future. In both our Games and FinTech businesses, some of our competitors and potential competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition; longer operating histories; pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers with respect to other financial services; greater financial, research, design, development, marketing, technological, and other resources; and more ready access to capital resources, which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, be in a better position to compete and, in respect of our cash access business, to pay higher commissions or other incentives to gaming establishments in order to gain new customers. In our FinTech business, we compete with other established providers of cash access products and services, including third-party transaction processors, financial institutions, and other regional and local banks that operate ATMs on the premises of gaming establishments. To the extent that we lose customers to these competitors, or competitive pressures force us to offer incentives or less favorable pricing terms for us to establish or maintain relationships with gaming establishments, our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022Consolidation among our customers or competitors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nWe often execute contracts with customers pursuant to which we provide products and services at multiple gaming establishments. Accordingly, the expiration or termination of a single key contract can mean the loss of multiple gaming facilities at which many of our products and services are used. Consolidation among operators of gaming establishments may also result in the loss of customers, if one of our customers is acquired by a business that utilizes one of our competitors, or significant margin compression, if rates vary between acquiring and acquired customers. Consolidation among our competitors in either the Games or FinTech sectors will only increase advantages these competitors may have over us as we compete for these customers, including even greater financial, research, design, development, marketing, technological, and other resources, and the ability to offer customers more favorable rates and prices due to lower operating costs resulting from efficiencies of scale and varying margins of a larger product portfolio, among other factors.\n\u2022Our business depends on our ability to introduce new, commercially viable games, products and services in a timely manner.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to develop and sell new games, products, and services that are attractive not only to our customers, but also to their customers, the gaming patrons. If our games, products, and services do not appeal to gaming operators and patrons, or do not meet or sustain revenue and profitability of contractual obligations and expectations, we may lose business to our competitors. Additionally, we may be unable to enhance existing games, products, and services in a timely manner in response to changing regulatory or legal requirements, or market conditions, or customer requirements, or new games, products and services may not achieve market acceptance in new or existing markets. Delay in regulatory approvals of new gaming devices and equipment may adversely impact new product deployment. If we are unable to keep pace with rapid innovations in new technologies or product design and deployment or if we are unable to quickly adapt our development, manufacturing or sales processes to compete, our business, financial condition, operations or cash flows could suffer a material adverse effect.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Business\n\u2022Unauthorized disclosure of cardholder and patron data or similar violations of applicable data privacy laws, whether through a security breach of our computer systems, our third-party processor\u2019s computer systems or otherwise, or through our unauthorized use or transmission of such data subjects us to costly fines, penalties, and legal claims.\nWe collect and store personally identifiable information about cardholders and patrons that perform certain cash access and Central Credit transactions, including names, addresses, social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, and account numbers, and we maintain a database of cardholder and patron data, including account numbers, in order to process our cash access and Central Credit transactions. We also rely on our third-party processor and certain other technology partners to process and store cardholder and patron data relating to our cash access and Central Credit transactions. As a result, we, as well as our third-party processor, certain of our other technology providers, and some of our gaming establishment customers, are required to comply with various foreign, federal, and state privacy statutes and\nregulations, and the PCI Data Security Standard. Compliance with these regulations and requirements, which are subject to change at any time, is often difficult and costly, and our failure, or the failure of these other third parties, to comply may result in significant fines or civil penalties, regulatory enforcement action, liability to our sponsor bank, and termination of our agreements with our gaming establishment customers, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows. If our computer systems or those of our third-party processor or other technology providers suffer a security breach, we may be subject to liability, including claims for unauthorized transactions with misappropriated bank card information, impersonation, or similar fraud claims, as well as for any failure to comply with laws governing required notifications of such a breach, and these claims could result in protracted and costly litigation, penalties, or sanctions from the card associations and EFT payment networks, and damage to our reputation, which could reduce and limit our ability to provide cash access and related services to our gaming establishment customers.\nThe personally identifiable information we collect also includes our patrons\u2019 transaction behavioral data and credit history data, which we may use to provide marketing and data intelligence services to gaming establishments. This information is increasingly subject to federal, state, and card association laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. Governmental regulations are typically intended to protect the privacy and security of such data and information as well as to regulate the collection, storage, transmission, transfer, use, and distribution of such data and information. We could be materially and adversely affected if domestic or international laws or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their laws or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business or even prohibit us from offering certain marketing and data intelligence or other services. Similarly, if we are required to allocate significant resources to modify our internal operating systems and procedures to enable enhanced protection of patron data that we transmit, store, and use, our business results could be adversely affected. In addition, we may face requirements that pose compliance challenges in new international markets that we seek to enter as various foreign jurisdictions have different laws and regulations concerning the storage, transmission, and use of gaming patron data. Such variation could subject us to costs, liabilities, or negative publicity that could impair our ability to expand our operations into some countries; therefore, it could limit our future growth.\n\u2022We are subject to extensive governmental gaming regulation, which may harm our business.\nOur ability to conduct both our gaming and cash access businesses, expand operations, develop and distribute new games, products and systems, and expand into new gaming markets is also subject to significant federal, state, local, Native American, and foreign regulations which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In the United States and many other countries, gaming must be expressly authorized by law. Once authorized, such activities are subject to extensive and evolving governmental regulation. The gaming laws, regulations, and ordinances generally concern the antecedents, acumen, financial stability, and character of our owners, officers, and directors, as well as those persons financially interested or involved in our companies; dictate the technical standards and regulations of our electronic player terminals, gaming systems, and certain other products; and set forth the process and manner by which the Gaming Authorities issue such licenses, findings of suitability, and product approvals. In addition, the suspension, revocation, non-renewal or limitation of any of our licenses or product approvals, or the inability to obtain or maintain requisite license or product approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to retain key employees. The Gaming Authorities may deny, limit, condition, suspend, or revoke a gaming license or related approval for violations of applicable gaming laws and regulations, and may impose substantial fines and take other actions, any one of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, changes in existing gaming laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing gaming laws may hinder or prevent us from continuing to operate in those jurisdictions where we currently do business, which could harm our operating results. In particular, the enactment of unfavorable legislation or government efforts affecting or directed at manufacturers or gaming operators, such as referendums to increase gaming taxes, or requirements to use local distributors, or uncertainty as to the means and manner in which existing gaming laws may be interpreted and applied, either singly or together, could have a negative impact on our operations.\nMoreover, in addition to the risk of enforcement action, we are also at risk of loss of business reputation in the event of any potential legal or regulatory investigation, whether or not we are ultimately accused of or found to have committed any violation. For a summary of gaming regulations that could affect our business, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation.\u201d\n\u2022Many of the financial services that we provide are subject to extensive rules and regulations, which may harm our business.\nOur Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau and warranty services are subject to the FCRA, the FACTA, and similar state laws. The collection practices that are used by our third-party providers and us may be subject to the FDCPA and applicable state laws relating to debt collection. All of our cash access services and patron marketing services are subject to the privacy provisions of state and federal law, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Our POS debit card cash access transactions and ATM withdrawal services are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Our ATM services are subject to the applicable state banking regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate ATMs. Our ATM services may also be subject to state and local regulations relating to the imposition of daily limits on the amounts that may be withdrawn from ATMs, the location of ATMs, our ability to surcharge cardholders who use our ATMs, and the form and type of notices that must be disclosed regarding the provision of our ATM services. The cash access services we provide are subject to record keeping and reporting obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, including as relates to our federally-mandated internal anti-money laundering program. We are required to file SARs with respect to transactions completed at all gaming establishments where we provide our cash access services through a gaming establishment\u2019s cashier or financial services center. If we are found to be noncompliant in any way with these laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties. In jurisdictions in which we serve as a check casher, we are subject to the applicable state licensing requirements and regulations governing check cashing activities. We are also subject to various state licensing requirements and regulations governing money transmitters. We may be required to obtain additional licenses from federal or state financial authorities in connection with our products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses, and, even if we were able to do so, there could be substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to formal or informal audits, inquiries, examinations, or reviews from time to time by the regulatory authorities that enforce these financial services rules and regulations. Although we have a compliance program that covers the laws and regulations that apply to our business, in the event that any regulatory authority determines that the manner in which we provide cash access, patron marketing, or gaming patron credit bureau services is not in compliance with existing rules and regulations, or the regulatory authorities adopt new rules or regulations that prohibit or restrict the manner in which we provide cash access, patron marketing, or gaming patron credit bureau services, then these regulatory authorities may force us to modify the manner in which we operate or force us to stop processing certain types of cash access transactions or providing patron marketing or gaming patron credit bureau services altogether. We may also be required to pay substantial penalties and fines if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations. For example, if we fail to file CTRs or SARs on a timely basis or if we are found to be noncompliant in any way with either the Bank Secrecy Act or the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations could subject us to private litigation.\n\u2022Gaming and financial services laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain application.\nGaming and financial services laws and regulations are subject to change and evolving interpretations and application, including through legislative amendments, new and proposed regulations, executive orders, and agency interpretations, and it can be difficult to predict how they may be applied to our business. We may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative, and other developments, and these changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or proposed products and services and/or increase our expenses in providing these products and services.\n\u2022We are subject to extensive rules and regulations of card associations, including VISA, MasterCard, and EFT networks that are always subject to change, which may harm our business.\nOur cash access business is subject to the extensive rules and regulations of the leading card associations, VISA and MasterCard. The rules and regulations do not expressly address some of the contexts and settings in which we process cash access transactions or do so in a manner subject to varying interpretations. As an example, we and certain of our providers must comply with the PCI Data Security Standard. The failure by any of such providers to comply with such standards could result in our being fined or being prohibited from processing transactions through VISA, MasterCard, and other card and payment networks. We also process transactions involving the use of the proprietary credit cards such as those offered by Discover Card and American Express, as well as other regional cards issued in certain international markets. The rules and regulations of the proprietary credit card networks that service these cards present risks to us that are similar to those posed by the rules and regulations of VISA, MasterCard, and other payment networks.\nThe card associations\u2019 and payment networks\u2019 rules and regulations are always subject to change, and the card associations or payment networks may modify their rules and regulations from time to time. Our inability to anticipate\nchanges in rules and regulations, or the interpretation or application thereof, may result in substantial disruption to our business. In the event that the card associations, payment networks or our sponsoring banks determine that the manner in which we process certain types of card transactions is not in compliance with existing rules and regulations, or if the card associations or payment networks adopt new rules or regulations that prohibit or restrict the manner in which we process certain types of card transactions, we may be forced to pay a fine, modify the manner in which we operate our business, or stop processing certain types of cash access transactions altogether, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022Card association and EFT network changes to interchange reimbursement rates or network operating fees or fees associated with the processing and settlement of our cash access transactions or otherwise change their operating rules and regulations may affect our revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), net income, and our business generally.\nWe receive income from issuers of ATM, credit, and debit cards for certain transactions performed on our ATMs related to cash dispensing or certain other non-financial transactions such as balance inquiries. The EFT networks may also charge certain fees related to the performance of these transactions. We refer to the net of this income and fees as reverse interchange. The amount of this reverse interchange income is determined by the card associations and EFT networks, and this income is subject to decrease at their discretion.\nWe pay interchange and other network fees for services to the credit card associations and EFT networks that they provide in settling transactions routed through their networks. Collectively, we call these charges interchange fees. Subject to the limitations imposed by federal regulations such as the Durbin Amendment or other regulations that may be enacted, the amounts of these interchange fees are determined based upon the sole discretion of the card associations and EFT networks and are subject to increase at any time. We have been seeing such card association interchange fee increases with higher frequency in recent years and with disproportionate negative impact upon transaction categories into which our cash access transactions typically fall. Competitive pressures might prevent us from passing all or some of these fees through to our customers in the future. To the extent that we are unable to pass through to our customers all or any portion of any increase in interchange or other network processing fees, our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) would increase and our net income would decrease, assuming no change in transaction volumes. Any such decrease in net income could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows. In addition, proposed changes to the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the repeal of the Durbin Amendment, if adopted, or other regulation that could be implemented to limit the amount of surcharge or service fees charged for our cash access transactions could have a negative impact on revenue and gross margins (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a result of reduced service fee revenue and potential increases in interchange rates merchants pay for debit card transactions.\nThe card associations and EFT networks may also elect to impose new membership or other fees, or implement new rules and regulations with respect to processing transactions through their networks, and any such new fees, rules, or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022The provision of our credit card access, POS debit, and ATM services are dependent upon our continued sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard card associations, and the suspension or termination of our sponsorship would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows.\nWe process virtually all of our credit card cash access, POS debit, and ATM service transactions through the VISA and MasterCard card associations, both domestically and internationally, and virtually all of the revenue that we derive from our credit card cash access, POS debit, and ATM services is dependent upon our continued sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard associations. We cannot provide these services without sponsorship into the VISA and MasterCard associations by a member financial institution. Our failure to maintain our current sponsorship arrangements or secure alternative sponsorship arrangements into the VISA and MasterCard associations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022Our ATM service business is subject to extensive rules and regulations, which may harm our business.\nOur ATM services are subject to the applicable federal, state, and local banking regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate ATMs, which regulations relate to the imposition of daily limits on the amounts that may be withdrawn from ATMs, the location of ATMs, our ability to surcharge cardholders who use our ATMs, and the form and type of notices that must be disclosed with respect to the fees we charge to patrons in connection with our ATM services. ATMs are also subject to requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which in general require that ATMs be accessible to individuals with disabilities, such as visually-impaired persons. These laws and regulations may impose significant\nburdens on our ability to operate ATMs profitably in some locations, or at all, and our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, because these regulations are subject to change, we may be forced to modify our ATM operations in a manner inconsistent with the assumptions upon which we relied when entering into contracts to provide ATM services at gaming establishments. If federal, state, local, or foreign authorities adopt new laws or regulations, or raise enforcement levels on existing laws and regulations that make it more difficult for us to operate our ATM business, then our revenues and earnings may be negatively affected. If legislation or regulations are enacted in the future that adversely impact our ATM business, we may be forced to modify our operations in a manner inconsistent with the assumptions upon which we relied when entering into contracts to provide ATMs at gaming establishments and our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows could suffer a material adverse effect.\n\u2022Changes to consumer privacy laws may require us to change our business practices or expend significant amounts on compliance with such laws.\nCertain of our products and services depend on the ability to collect and use non-public personal, financial transaction, and or other information relating to patrons. To the extent that we collect, control, or process such information, federal, state, and foreign privacy laws and regulations, including without limitation CCPA and GDPR, require us to make disclosures regarding our privacy and information sharing practices, safeguard and protect the privacy of such information, and, in some cases, provide patrons the opportunity to \u201copt out\u201d of the use of their information for certain purposes. We must comply with federal, state, and foreign requirements regarding notice and consent to obtain, use, share, transmit and store such information.\nConsumer protection and data privacy laws are rapidly evolving due to recent high-profile thefts and losses of sensitive consumer information from protected databases. Such laws may broaden the scope of protected information; impose new and/or stricter standards concerning the collection, control, use, sharing, and protection of consumer information; and/or require patrons to \u201copt-in\u201d to the use of their information for specific purposes. Our compliance with any or all of which may be costly and challenging to operationalize across the uneven requirements of the numerous domestic and international jurisdictions in which we do business.\nChanges in consumer protection and data privacy laws may require us to narrow or limit the data we collect; limit how, or how long, we may use it; or require us to purge data from our systems in response to consumer requests, which may hamper our provision of certain of our data-related services or diminish the value of such services to our customers and result in loss of business. To the extent that patrons exercise their right to \u201copt out,\u201d or are required to \u201copt in,\u201d our ability to leverage existing and future databases of information would be curtailed. Further, in order to continue to provide such products and services, we may be required to make material modifications to the products and services we offer in order to meet the changing standards, which may result in significant redesign and redeployment costs to us.\nTo the extent that we fail to comply with applicable consumer protection and data privacy laws, we may become subject to actions by individuals or regulatory authorities, which may result in the payment of fines or the imposition of other monetary or non-monetary penalties.\nThe failure or circumvention of the means by which we safeguard and protect the privacy of information we gather may result in the dissemination of non-public personal information, which may harm our reputation and may expose us to liability to the affected individuals and regulatory enforcement proceedings or fines.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022We have recorded net losses in the current year and we may not generate profits in the future.\nWe had a net loss of $81.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and net income of $16.5 million and $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result of the interest payments on the indebtedness incurred in connection with Everi Holdings\u2019 purchase of Everi Games in December 2014 (the \u201cMerger\u201d), amortization of intangible assets associated with the Merger and other acquisitions, other related acquisition and financing costs, asset impairment charges, depreciation, and other amortization, we may not be able to generate profits in the future. Our ability to continue to generate net profits in the future depends, in part, on our ability to: establish strategic business relationships with new and existing customers; retain our existing customers and expand our relationships with existing customers; provide our products and services in new markets and to new customers in existing markets; develop new games or license third-party content in our Games business and develop new products and services in our FinTech business; effectively manage a larger and more diverse workforce and business; react to changes, including technological and regulatory changes, in the markets we target or operate in; respond to competitive\ndevelopments and challenges; continue to comply with the EMV global standard for cards equipped with security chip technology; and attract and retain experienced and talented personnel.\nWe may not be able to do any of these successfully, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows, which could, among other things, affect our ability to make payments under our Credit Facilities (defined herein) or the 2017 Unsecured Notes (defined herein).\n\u2022We expect the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to those described above in previous risk factor sub-captions.", "PERMNO": 90885, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "EVRI"}
