{"cik": "1603923", "company": "Weatherford International plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks. You should consider carefully all of the risk factors described below, the matters discussed herein under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our services and products is affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, especially a substantial or extended decline, which, in turn, affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and impede our growth.\nDemand for our services and products is tied to the level of exploration, development, production activity and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical and economic conditions. We depend on our customers' willingness to make capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas. Therefore, declines in oil and natural gas prices (especially if prolonged) or the perception by our customers that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, or remain depressed will result in a reduction in the utilization of our equipment and could result in lower rates for our services.\nPrices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, global market uncertainty, the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, member-country quota compliance within OPEC, governmental policies and subsidies, technological advances affecting energy consumption, weather conditions and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. Any perceived or actual reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity and decrease spending by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial decline in oil and natural gas prices generally leads to decreased spending by our customers. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur business is dependent on capital spending by our customers, and reductions in capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our contracts can be cancelled by our customer at any time. Such cancellation or any further change in capital expenditures by our customers or reductions in their capital spending could directly impact our business by reducing demand for our services and products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and impede our growth. Spending by exploration and production companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause exploration and production companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil prices change from current levels or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services and the rates we can charge and the utilization of our assets. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves or a decrease in the development rate of reserves in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, could also have a material adverse impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment. With respect to national oil company customers, we are also subject to risk of policy, regime, currency and budgetary changes.\nSeasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations.\nVariation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand. Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or extreme winter conditions in Canada, Russia and the North Sea, may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions or loss of productivity or result in a loss of revenue or damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oilfield services business is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Additionally, the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of our competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\nOur business, particularly marketing our products and services to our customers and securing equipment and trained personnel, is highly competitive. This competitive environment could impact our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain or increase pricing for our products and services and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers and suppliers, due in part to the industry\u2019s capacity relative to customer demand and our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from that of our competitors. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to add value for our customers by providing, relative to our peers, new technologies, reliable products and services and competent personnel. The anticipated timing and cost of the development of competitive technology and new product introductions can impact our financial results, particularly if one of our competitors were to develop competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services. Additionally, we may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active, particularly if one or more of our competitors is already operating in that area of the world.\nFurthermore, two of our largest competitors, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, have announced a plan to combine. Mergers, combinations and consolidation in our industry could result in existing competitors, such as Halliburton and Baker Hughes, increasing their market share and may result in stronger competitors, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our other competitors or us.\nPhysical dangers are inherent in our operations and may expose us to significant potential losses. Personnel and property may be harmed during the process of drilling for oil and natural gas.\nDrilling for and producing hydrocarbons, and the associated products and services that we provide, include inherent dangers that may lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. Many of these events are outside our control. Typically, we provide products and services at a well site where our personnel and equipment are located together with personnel and equipment of our customer and third parties, such as other service providers. At many sites, we depend on other companies and personnel to conduct drilling operations in accordance with appropriate safety standards. From time to time, personnel are injured or equipment or property is damaged or destroyed as a result of accidents, failed equipment, faulty products or services, failure of safety measures, uncontained formation pressures or other dangers inherent in drilling for oil and natural gas. Any of these events can be the result of human error. With increasing frequency, our products and services are deployed on more challenging prospects both onshore and offshore, where the occurrence of the types of events mentioned above can have an even more catastrophic impact on people, equipment and the environment. Such events may expose us to significant potential losses.\nWe may not be fully indemnified against financial losses in all circumstances where damage to or loss of property, personal injury, death or environmental harm occur.\nAs is customary in our industry, our contracts typically require that our customers indemnify us for claims arising from the injury or death of their employees (and those of their other contractors), the loss or damage of their equipment (and that of their other contractors), damage to the well or reservoir and pollution originating from the customer\u2019s equipment or from the reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for claims arising from the injury or death of our employees, the loss or damage of our equipment (other than equipment lost in the hole) or pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth or water. Our contracts typically provide that our customer will indemnify us for claims arising from catastrophic events, such as a well blowout, fire, explosion and from pollution below the surface.\nOur indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. For example, from time to time we may enter into contracts with less favorable indemnities or perform work without a contract that protects us. Our indemnity arrangements may also be held to be overly broad in some courts and jurisdictions, and to that extent unenforceable. We may be subject to claims brought by third\nparties or government agencies with respect to which we are not indemnified. Furthermore, the parties from which we seek indemnity may not be solvent, may become bankrupt, may lack resources or insurance to honor their indemnities or may not otherwise be able to satisfy their indemnity obligations to us. The lack of enforceable indemnification could expose us to significant potential losses.\nFurther, our assets generally are not insured against loss from political violence such as war, terrorism or civil commotion. If any of our assets are damaged or destroyed as a result of an uninsured cause, we could recognize a loss of those assets.\nOur business may be exposed to uninsured claims and, as a result, litigation might result in significant potential losses. The cost of our insured risk management program may increase.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims and litigation. We maintain liability insurance, which includes insurance against damage to people, property and the environment, up to maximum limits of $600 million, subject to self-insured retentions and deductibles.\nOur insurance policies are subject to exclusions, limitations and other conditions and may not apply in all cases, for example where willful wrongdoing on our part is alleged. It is possible an unexpected judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring, and in some cases those potential losses could be material.\nOur insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss, or our insurance may not cover all losses. For example, although we maintain product liability insurance, this type of insurance is limited in coverage and it is possible an adverse claim could arise in excess of our coverage. Finally, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation. In response to the April 2010 catastrophic accident in the Gulf of Mexico, insurance rates are volatile and increasing, and some forms of insurance may become entirely unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we or our customers believe are economically acceptable. Reductions in coverage, changes in the insurance markets and accidents affecting our industry may result in further increases in our cost and higher deductibles and retentions in future years and may also result in reduced activity levels in certain markets. Any of these events would have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and other laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities and could reduce our business opportunities and revenues.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the energy industry in general and the environment in particular. An environmental claim could arise with respect to one or more of our current businesses, products or services, or a business or property that one of our predecessors owned or used, and such claims could involve material expenditures. Generally, environmental laws have in recent years become more stringent and have sought to impose greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties. The scope of regulation of our industry and our products and services may increase further, including possible increases in liabilities or funding requirements imposed by governmental agencies. We also cannot ensure that our future business in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, if any, will be profitable in light of new regulations that have been, and may continue to be, promulgated and in light of the current risk environment and insurance markets. Further, additional regulations on deepwater drilling elsewhere in the world could be imposed, and those regulations could limit our business where they are imposed.\nIn addition, members of the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various agencies of several states within the U.S. frequently review, consider and propose more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a service we provide to clients, and regulators are investigating whether any chemicals used in the fracturing process might adversely affect groundwater or whether the fracturing processes could lead to other unintended effects or damages. In recent years, several cities and states within the U.S. passed new laws and regulations concerning or banning hydraulic fracturing. A significant portion of North American service activity today is directed at prospects that require hydraulic fracturing in order to produce hydrocarbons. Therefore, additional regulation could increase the costs of conducting our business by subjecting fracturing to more stringent regulation. Such regulation, among other things, may change construction standards for wells intended for hydraulic fracturing, require additional certifications concerning the conduct of hydraulic fracturing operations, change requirements pertaining to the management of water used in hydraulic fracturing operations, require other measures intended to prevent operational hazards or ban hydraulic fracturing completely. Any such federal, state, local or foreign legislation could increase our costs of providing services or could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation or if we are not able to pass along any cost increases to our customers. We are unable to predict whether changes in laws or regulations or any other governmental proposals or responses will ultimately occur, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business.\nWe conduct some of our business using fixed-fee or turn-key contracts, which subject us to risks associated with cost over-runs, operating cost inflation and potential claims for liquidated damages.\nWe conduct our business under various types of contracts, including in some cases fixed-fee or turn-key contracts where we estimate costs in advance of our performance. We price these types of contracts based in part on assumptions including prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials as well as productivity, performance and future economic conditions. If our cost estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of equipment and materials or our suppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 inability to perform, then cost over-runs may occur. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred in all cases. Additionally, in some contracts we may be required to pay liquidated damages if we do not achieve schedule or performance requirements of our contracts. Our failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for fixed-fee contracts or our failure to complete our contractual obligations within the time frame and costs committed could result in reduced profits or a loss for that contract. If the contract is significant, or we encounter issues that impact multiple contracts, cost over-runs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, during 2013 and 2014, we recognized estimated project losses of $232 million and $72 million, respectively, related to our long-term early production facility construction contracts in Iraq accounted for under the percentage of completion method. Total estimated losses on these two projects were $379 million at December 31, 2014.\nIf our long-lived assets, goodwill, other intangible assets and other assets are further impaired, we may be required to record significant non-cash charges to our earnings.\nWe have been required to record impairments of goodwill to the extent the fair value of any of our reporting units becomes less than its carrying value and we may be required to record further impairments in the future. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about future cash flows of each reporting unit, discount rates applied to these cash flows and current market estimates of value. Based on the uncertainty of future revenue growth rates, gross profit performance, and other assumptions used to estimate goodwill recoverability, future reductions in our expected cash flows could cause a material non-cash impairment charge of goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Based on the results of our impairment tests we recognized impairments to goodwill of $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2014; $121 million in the second quarter of 2014; and $589 million in the second quarter of 2012. See \u201cNote 9 - Goodwill\u201d for additional information regarding the long-lived assets impairment.\nWe also have certain long-lived assets, other intangible assets and other assets which could be at risk of impairment or may require reserves based upon anticipated future benefits to be derived from such assets. Any change in the valuation of such assets could have a material effect on our profitability. Based on certain impairment indicators, we performed an analysis of our drilling rig fleet and, in the fourth quarter of 2014, recorded long-lived and other asset impairment charges of $352 million to adjust the assets of our rig business to fair value. The impairment charges included the impairment of our drilling rigs and other related intangible assets. In the second quarter of 2014 we concluded that the planned sale of our land drilling and workover operations in Russia and Venezuela represented an indicator of impairment and we prepared the analysis necessary to identify the potential impairment and recognize any necessary impairment loss. As a result of our commitment to sell, we recorded a $143 million long-lived assets impairment loss. See \u201cNote 8 - Long-lived Asset Impairments\u201d for additional information regarding the long-lived assets impairment.\nWe have significant operations that would be adversely impacted in the event of war, political disruption, civil disturbance, economic and legal sanctions or changes in global trade policies.\nLike most multinational oilfield service companies, we have operations in certain international areas, including parts of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, the Asia Pacific, Europe and Russia regions that are subject to risks of war, political disruption, civil disturbance, economic and legal sanctions (such as restrictions against countries that the U.S. government may deem to sponsor terrorism) and changes in global trade policies. Our operations may be restricted or prohibited in any country in which the foregoing risks occur.\nIn particular, the occurrence of any of these risks could result in the following events, which in turn, could materially and adversely impact our results of operations:\n\u2022\ndisruption of oil and natural gas exploration and production activities;\n\u2022\nrestriction of the movement and exchange of funds;\n\u2022\nour inability to collect receivables;\n\u2022\nloss of or nationalization of assets in affected jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nenactment of additional or stricter U.S. government or international sanctions; and\n\u2022\nlimitation of our access to markets for periods of time.\nIn the third quarter of 2014, geopolitical issues and disruptions in North Africa, primarily Libya, resulted in the decisions to exit product lines in selected markets, which had a negative impact on our 2014 results. We recognized a restructuring and long-lived asset impairment of $81 million related to these markets. We risk loss of assets in any location where hostilities arise and persist. In these areas we also may not be able to perform the work we are contracted to perform, which could lead to forfeiture of performance bonds.\nContinuing political instability in Ukraine, sanctions against Russia, and Russia\u2019s potential response to those sanctions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2014, the Crimean region of Ukraine was annexed by Russia. In response, other nations, including the U.S., have imposed, and may continue imposing further, economic sanctions on Russia and Ukraine. Presently, concerns related to ongoing unrest in Ukraine have prompted calls for increasing levels of economic sanctions against Russia and Ukraine. A significant amount of our revenues and business transactions are from Russia and its surrounding areas. Continuing political instability in the surrounding region and additional economic sanctions imposed by either the U.S. or the world community may result in serious economic challenges in Russia and the surrounding areas, and the imposition of trade restrictions may delay or prevent shipment of products to or services performed in those countries, resulting in a significant impact on our business and other planned transactions. Further, potential responses by Russia to those sanctions could adversely affect European economic conditions, which could in turn affect our business in Europe. Accordingly, continuing political instability in Ukraine, sanctions against Russia and Russia\u2019s potential response to such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe divestiture of our land drilling rigs business may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and we may not achieve the intended benefits of our divestitures completed in 2014.\nIn 2014, we divested certain of our non-core business lines (land drilling rigs in Russia and Venezuela, engineered chemistry and Integrity drilling fluids, pipeline and specialty services and production services). We have not yet completed the divestiture of the remaining portion of our land drilling rigs, which we may accomplish through an initial public offering, a spin-off, an asset sale, or some combination of the foregoing. Any such divestiture would be complex in nature and may be affected by unanticipated developments, such as unfavorable market conditions, including as a result of the recent and significant decrease in the price of crude oil, delays in obtaining regulatory or governmental approvals and challenges in establishing processes and infrastructure for both the underlying business and for potential investors or buyers of the business, which may result in such divestiture being delayed, or not being completed at all. In addition, for divestitures we completed in 2014, we incurred considerable expense, and spent significant amounts of time. There is no guarantee that we will fully realize the intended benefits of consummating such divestiture transactions.\nWe have been the subject of governmental and internal investigations related to alleged corrupt conduct and violations of U.S. sanctioned country laws, which were costly to conduct, resulted in a loss of revenue and substantial financial penalties and created other disruptions for the business. If we are the subject of such investigations in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2013 and 2014, we settled investigations of prior alleged violations by us and certain of our subsidiaries related to certain trade sanctions laws, participation in the United Nations oil-for-food program governing sales of goods into Iraq and non-compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). These settlement agreements required us to pay $253 million and to retain, for a period of at least 18 months, an independent monitor responsible for assessing our compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements so as to address and reduce the risk of recurrence of alleged misconduct, after which we would continue to evaluate our own compliance program and make periodic reports to the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and SEC and to maintain agreed compliance monitoring and reporting systems, all of which was and is costly to us. These settlement agreements also require us to retain an independent third party to retroactively audit our compliance with U.S. export control laws during the years 2012, 2013 and 2014.\nFailure to comply with the terms of the settlement agreements could have serious consequences. Breach of the settlement agreements with the DOJ could subject us and certain of our subsidiaries to prosecution for the FCPA and trade sanctions criminal\nviolations that were resolved in the settlement. Under such circumstances, the DOJ would be permitted to rely upon the admissions we and certain of our subsidiaries made in the settlement, and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defenses. In addition, if we were to breach the terms of the settlement agreements concerning trade sanctions violations, all of our export privileges, and the export privileges of certain of our subsidiaries, could be revoked for one year. Moreover, failure to abide by the terms of the settlement agreements with the SEC or the Commerce or Treasury Departments would permit these agencies to pursue rescission of the settlement agreements, exposing us and certain of our subsidiaries to civil enforcement proceedings in connection with the conduct that had previously been resolved in those settlement agreements.\nTo the extent we violate trade sanctions laws, the FCPA or other laws or regulations in the future, additional fines and other penalties may be imposed and there would be uncertainty as to the ultimate amount of any penalties we could pay and there can be no assurance that actual fines or penalties, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor additional information about these actions and claims, you should refer to the section entitled \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 20 - Disputes, Litigation and Contingencies.\u201d\nOur significant international operations subject us to economic risks and we may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency including devaluation and changes in local banking and currency regulations and exchange controls.\nWe operate in virtually every oil and natural gas exploration and production region in the world. In some parts of the world, such as Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, the currency of our primary economic environment is the U.S. dollar, and we use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency. In other parts of the world, we conduct our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency is the applicable local currency. As such, we are exposed to significant currency fluctuation exchange risk and devaluation risk. For example, in 2014 and 2013, we recognized pre-tax charges of $245 million ($252 million after-tax) and $100 million ($94 million after-tax), respectively, on the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuertes (\u201cbolivars\u201d). For information about the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation, you should refer to the section entitled \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d Any future change in the exchange rate we have adopted in Venezuela could cause us to take additional charges on the bolivar denominated assets held by our subsidiaries.\nWe are also subject to risks resulting from changes in the implementation of exchange controls, as well as limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries. If we are unable to reinvest earnings or repatriate foreign income, our liquidity and recognition of income tax liabilities may be negatively affected.\nWe have noted the concerns raised by the International Monetary Fund (\u201cIMF\u201d) relating to the accuracy of Argentina\u2019s officially reported consumer price index. Given the lack of verifiable information, objective sources have not observed data that would support designating Argentina as \u201cHighly Inflationary.\u201d We are closely monitoring the work of the IMF and the price index information that becomes available. As of December 31, 2014, we had a net monetary asset position denominated in Argentina pesos of $120 million, comprised primarily of accounts receivable and current liabilities. Any future change in the exchange rate we have adopted in Argentina could cause us to take charges or to change the exchange rate we use and could also result in gains or losses on the Argentine peso denominated assets held by our subsidiaries.\nThe credit risks of our concentrated customer base could result in losses.\nThe concentration of our customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Those countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports would be hit particularly hard by a drop in oil prices. Further, laws in some jurisdictions in which we operate could make collection difficult or time consuming. We perform on-going credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations.\nOur business in Venezuela subjects us to actions by the Venezuelan government or our primary customer which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe future results of our Venezuelan operations may be adversely affected by many factors, including our ability to take action to mitigate the effect of a further devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, the foreign currency exchange rate and exchange controls, other actions of the Venezuelan government and the general economic conditions in the country, resulting from continued inflation and future customer payments and spending. We may continue to see a delay in payment on our receivables from our primary customer in Venezuela or may be compelled to accept bonds as payment, which may then be sold at a loss. On December 17, 2013, we accepted bonds with a face value of $127 million from PDVSA in full settlement of $127 million in trade receivables. Upon receipt, we immediately sold these bonds in a series of transactions recognizing a loss of $58 million. If PDVSA further delays paying or fails to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, or if there is a major action by the Venezuelan government, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nCredit rating agencies could lower our credit ratings.\nCredit rating agencies could downgrade our credit ratings. Our Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services\u2019 (\u201cS&P\u201d) credit rating on our senior unsecured debt is currently BBB- and our short-term rating is A-3. On December 22, 2014, S&P placed our ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. Our Moody\u2019s Investors Ratings Services\u2019 credit rating on our unsecured debt is currently Baa3 and our short-term rating is P-3, both with a stable outlook. If our credit ratings are lowered to non-investment grade levels this could limit our ability to refinance our existing debt, could cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions and could increase certain fees and interest rates of our borrowings. Suppliers and financial institutions may lower or eliminate the level of credit provided through payment terms or intraday funding when dealing with us thereby increasing the need for higher levels of cash on hand, which would decrease our ability to repay debt balances.\nAny capital financing that may be necessary to fund growth may not be available to us at economic rates.\nThe condition of the credit and equity markets and the potential impact on liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund growth opportunities through borrowings, under either existing or newly created instruments in the public or private markets on terms we believe to be reasonable. If we are unable to borrow via debt offerings, our credit facility or commercial paper program, we could experience a reduction of liquidity and may result in difficulty funding our operations, repayment of short-term borrowings, payments of interest and other obligations. This could be detrimental to our business and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nA terrorist attack could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in many dangerous countries, such as Iraq, in which acts of terrorism or political violence are a substantial and frequent risk. Such acts could result in kidnappings or the loss of life of our employees or contractors, a loss of equipment, which may or may not be insurable in all cases, or a cessation of business in an affected area. We cannot be certain that our security efforts will in all cases be sufficient to deter or prevent acts of political violence or terrorist strikes against us or our customers\u2019 operations.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting has resulted in governmental investigations and shareholder lawsuits and could further result in material misstatements in our financial statements which, in turn, could require us to restate financial statements, may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could have an adverse effect on our share price or our debt ratings.\nWe have previously identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that had resulted in a material weakness in accounting for income taxes. As of December 31, 2013, we remediated our material weakness in accounting for income taxes. We cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and/or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, potentially leading to a decline in our share price.\nThe SEC and DOJ are investigating the circumstances surrounding the prior material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting for income taxes and the restatements of our historical financial statements in 2011 and 2012. We are cooperating fully with these investigations.\nAdditionally, in March 2011, a shareholder derivative action was filed purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain current and former officers and directors, alleging breaches of duty related to the material weakness and restatement announcements. In February 2012, a second shareholder derivative action was filed. In March 2012, a second purported securities class action captioned Freedman v. Weatherford International LTD., et al., No. 12-cv-2121-LAK (SDNY) was filed against us and certain current and former officers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. That case alleges violation of the federal securities laws related to the restatement of our historical financial statements announced on February 21, 2012, and later added claims related to the announcement of a subsequent restatement on July 24, 2012. That case is in active discovery. For additional information about these actions and claims, you should refer to the section entitled \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 20 - Disputes, Litigation and Contingencies.\u201d\nWe are unable to predict the outcome of these investigations and lawsuits due to the inherent uncertainties they present and we are unable to predict potential outcomes or estimate the range of potential loss contingencies, if any. The government, generally, has a broad range of civil and criminal penalties available for these types of matters under applicable law and regulation, including injunctive relief, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices, some of which, if imposed on us, could be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. For additional information about these actions and claims, you should refer to the section entitled \u201cItem 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 20 - Disputes, Litigation and Contingencies.\u201d\nAdditionally, in March 2011, a purported shareholder class action captioned Dobina v. Weatherford International Ltd., et al., No. 1:11-cv-01646-LAK (SDNY), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, following our announcement on March 1, 2011 of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting for income taxes, and restatement of our historical financial statements. The Dobina lawsuit alleged violation of the federal securities laws by us and certain current and former officers. On January 29, 2014, we, together with certain current and former officers, resolved the Dobina lawsuit. The settlement was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on January 5, 2015, and final judgment entered on January 30, 2015. Pursuant to the settlement, we were required to pay $53 million, which was entirely funded by our insurers, in exchange for dismissal with prejudice of the litigation and the unconditional release of all claims, known or unknown, that settlement class members brought or could have brought against us and individual defendants related to the facts and allegations in the litigation. As a condition of the settlement, we and the other defendants deny any liability or wrongdoing related to the allegations in the litigation.\nAdverse changes in tax laws both in the United States and abroad, changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn 2002, we reorganized from the United States to a foreign jurisdiction. There are frequent legislative proposals in the United States that attempt to treat companies that have undertaken similar transactions as U.S. corporations subject to U.S. taxes or to limit the tax deductions or tax credits available to United States subsidiaries of these corporations. The realization of the tax benefit of becoming foreign incorporated could be impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions. The inability to realize this benefit could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOur effective tax rate has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries in which we operate with differing tax rates, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws. Numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have been influenced by studies performed by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) and are increasingly active in evaluating changes to their tax laws. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued various white papers addressing Tax Base Erosion and Jurisdictional Profit Shifting. Their recommendations are aimed at combating what they believe is tax avoidance. Changes in tax laws could affect the distribution of our earnings and the results of our operations.\nU.S. persons that own, or are deemed to own, 10% or more of our shares may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation under the controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d) rules and may also subject the Company to increased taxation. The potential for shareholders to be taxed under the CFC rules may impact demand for our shares.\nCurrently, certain of our subsidiary corporations are not considered CFCs because they are less than 50% owned by our U.S. group of subsidiaries and other 10% or greater shareholders. However, there is a risk that if a U.S. shareholder holds 10% or more of our shares, directly, indirectly or by attribution, that some of our subsidiaries could be classified as CFCs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If one or more of our subsidiaries is classified as a CFC, any shareholder that is a U.S. person that owns, directly or indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more of our outstanding shares, as well as the Company, may be subject to U.S. income taxation at ordinary income tax rates on all or a portion of the CFC\u2019s undistributed earnings and profits attributable to \u201csubpart F income.\u201d The CFC rules are complex and U.S. persons that hold our shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the CFC rules to them in their particular circumstances. The risk of being subject to increased taxation may deter our current shareholders from acquiring additional ordinary shares or new shareholders from establishing a position in our ordinary shares. Either of these scenarios could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares.\nThe anticipated benefits of our redomestication to Ireland may not be realized. Additionally, we and our shareholders could be subject to increased taxation if we are considered to be a tax resident in both Switzerland and Ireland.\nIn 2014, we redomesticated from Switzerland to Ireland. We may not realize the benefits we anticipate from this redomestication. Our failure to realize those benefits could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, while we moved our place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland in 2014, we continue to be effectively managed from Switzerland. Under current Swiss law a company is regarded as a Swiss tax resident if it has its place of effective management in Switzerland or is incorporated in Switzerland. Where a company is treated as a tax resident of Switzerland as a result of having its place of effective management in Switzerland, Irish law provides Ireland will generally treat the company as not resident in Ireland for Irish tax purposes. We intend to maintain our place of effective management in Switzerland and therefore qualify as a Swiss, but not Irish, tax resident. However, it is possible that in the future, whether as a result of a change in law or tax treaty or how we manage our business, that we could become a tax resident in Ireland in addition to Switzerland. If we were to be considered to be a tax resident of Ireland, we could become liable for Irish and Swiss corporation tax and any dividends paid to its shareholders could be subject to Irish and Swiss dividend withholding tax.\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Irish law following our 2014 redomestication from Switzerland to Ireland. Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. Additionally, while we are an Irish company, we hold shareholders meetings in Switzerland, which may make attendance in person more difficult for some investors.\nWe are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States.\nWe are organized under the laws of Ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the United States. The United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in Ireland. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. The laws of Ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the United States have the same validity in Ireland as if rendered by Irish Courts. Certain important requirements must be satisfied before the Irish Courts will recognize the U.S. judgment. The originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it\nwas obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to Irish public policy. Any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in Ireland.\nSimilarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the United States where we have assets.", "PERMNO": 32791, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "WFTLF"}
