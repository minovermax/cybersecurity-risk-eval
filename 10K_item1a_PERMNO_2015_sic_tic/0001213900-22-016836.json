{"cik": "1641398", "company": "Code Chain New Continent Ltd", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our shares of common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained in this annual report, before you decide to buy any shares. Any of the following risks could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to suffer materially, causing the market price of our shares of common stock to decline, in which event you may lose part or all of your investment in our shares of common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not deem material may also become important factors that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nIf the PRC government deems that the VIE agreements in relation to Wuge, our consolidated variable interest entity or VIE, do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations and our common stock may decline in value dramatically or even become worthless.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in Nevada. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct substantially all of our operations through Wuge, the consolidated variable interest entity (or VIE) established in PRC. For accounting purposes, we receive the economic benefits of Wuge through the VIE agreements, which enable us to consolidate the financial results of Wuge in our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP and the structure involves unique risks to investors. For more details on the VIE structure, please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Corporate Structure - Contractual Arrangements between Wuge And Makesi WFOE\u201d.\nWe rely on and expect to continue to rely on the VIE agreements to operate our business. These contractual arrangements are not as effective in providing us with control over Wuge as ownership of controlling equity interests would be in enabling us to derive economic benefits from the operations of Wuge. Under the current contractual arrangements, as a legal matter, if Wuge or any of its shareholders executing the VIE agreements fails to perform its, his or her respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies available under PRC laws, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective. For example, if Wuge\u2019s shareholders were to refuse to transfer their equity interests in such variable interest entity to us or our designated persons when we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, we may have to take a legal action to compel them to fulfill their contractual obligations. Wuge and its shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. If we had direct ownership of Wuge, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of Wuge, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management and operational level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by Wuge and its shareholders of their obligations under the contracts. The shareholders of Wuge may not act in the best interests of our Company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate the business through the contractual arrangements with Wuge.\nAll of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. The VIE agreements have not been tested in a court of law. If (i) the applicable PRC authorities invalidate the VIE agreements for violation of PRC laws, rules and regulations, (ii) Wuge or its shareholders terminate the contractual arrangements, (iii) Wuge or its shareholders fail to perform its/his/her obligations under these contractual arrangements, or (iv) if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, we may have to modify such structure to comply with regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that we can achieve this without material disruption to our business. Furthermore, if Makesi WFOE or Wuge is/are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf revoking the business license and/or operating licenses of Makesi WFOE or Wuge;\n\u25cf discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations through any transactions among Makesi WFOE and Wuge;\n\u25cf imposing fines, confiscating the income from Makesi WFOE or Wuge, or imposing other requirements with which Makesi WFOE or Wuge may not be able to comply;\n\u25cf placing restrictions on our right to collect revenues;\n\u25cf shutting down our servers or blocking our app/websites;\n\u25cf requiring us to restructure our ownership structure or operations, including terminating the contractual arrangements with Wuge and deregistering the equity pledges of Wuge, which in turn would affect our ability to consolidate or derive economic interests from Wuge; or\n\u25cf restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds of future financings to finance our business and operations in China.\n\u25cf taking other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties would result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, thus causing the value of our common stock to significantly decline or be worthless, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. In addition, it is unclear what impact the PRC government actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of Wuge in our consolidated financial statements, if the PRC government authorities were to find our corporate structure and contractual arrangements to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations. If the imposition of any of these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of Wuge or our right to receive substantially all the economic benefits and residual returns from Wuge and we are not able to restructure our ownership structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of Wuge in our consolidated financial statements. Either of these results, or any other significant penalties that might be imposed on us in this event, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if Wuge or all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our business activities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Wuge undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, its shareholders or unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business and our ability to generate revenues.\nWe are a holding company, and will rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs. Any limitation on the ability of Makesi WFOE to make dividend payments to us, or any tax implications of making dividend payments to us, could limit our ability to pay our parent company expenses or pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nWe are a holding company with no material operation of our own. We may rely on dividends to be paid by our subsidiaries to fund our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us.\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiary, Makesi WFOE, which is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China, may pay dividends only out of its accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a certain statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital.\nWuge, the VIE with with Makesi WFOE has contractual arrangement with, generates primarily all of its revenue in Renminbi, which is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our PRC subsidiary to use its Renminbi revenues to pay dividends to us. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and more restrictions and substantial vetting process may be put forward by State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the \u201cSAFE\u201d) for cross-border transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends or make other kinds of payments to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nIn addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are incorporated. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nShareholders of Wuge may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe equity interests of Wuge are held by a total of four shareholders, Wei Xu, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of CCNC, Bibo Lin, Vice President and Director of CCNC, Jiangsu Lingkong Network Joint Stock Co., Ltd., which is controlled by Wei Xu, and Anhui Shuziren Network Technology Co., Ltd., which is controlled by Wei Xu. Their interests may differ from the interests of our Company as a whole. They may breach, or cause Wuge to breach, or refuse to renew the existing VIE agreements Makesi WFOE has with Wuge, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to receive economic benefits from them. For example, the shareholders may be able to cause our agreements with Wuge to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing to remit payments due under the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, any or all of these shareholders will act in the best interests of our Company or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nCurrently, we do not have arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest the shareholders of Wuge may encounter, on one hand, and as a beneficial owner of our Company, on the other hand. We, however, could, at all times, exercise our option under the Exclusive Option Agreement to cause them to transfer all of their equity ownership in Wuge to a PRC entity or individual designated by us as permitted by the then applicable PRC laws. In addition, if such conflicts of interest arise, we could also, in the capacity of attorney-in-fact of the then existing shareholders of Wuge as provided under the power of attorney, directly appoint new directors of Wuge . We rely on the shareholders of Wuge to comply with PRC laws and regulations, which protect contracts and provide that directors and executive officers owe a duty of loyalty to our Company and require them to avoid conflicts of interest and not to take advantage of their positions for personal gains, and the laws of Nevada, which provide that the directors have a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to act honestly in good faith with a view to our best interests. However, the legal frameworks of China and Nevada do not provide guidance on resolving conflicts in the event of a conflict with another corporate governance regime. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and the shareholders of Wuge , we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings. As a result, our common stock may decline in value dramatically or even become worthless should we become unable to assert our contractual rights over the assets of Wuge that conducts all or substantially our operations.\nContractual arrangements in relation to Wuge may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities and they may determine that we or Wuge owe/owes additional taxes, which could negatively affect our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nUnder applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities within ten years after the taxable year when the transactions are conducted. The PRC enterprise income tax law requires every enterprise in China to submit its annual enterprise income tax return together with a report on transactions with its related parties to the relevant tax authorities. The tax authorities may impose reasonable adjustments on taxation if they have identified any related party transactions that are inconsistent with arm\u2019s length principles. We may face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements between our WFOE, our variable interest entity Wuge and the shareholders of Wuge were not entered into on an arm\u2019s length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and adjust Wuge\u2019s income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by Wuge for PRC tax purposes, which could, in turn, increase their tax liabilities without reducing Makesi WFOE\u2019s tax expenses. In addition, if Makesi WFOE requests the shareholders of Wuge to transfer their equity interests in Wuge at nominal or no value pursuant to these contractual arrangements, such transfer could be viewed as a gift and subject Makesi WFOE to PRC income tax. Furthermore, the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties on Wuge for the adjusted but unpaid taxes according to the applicable regulations. Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if Wuge\u2019s tax liabilities increase or if they are required to pay late payment fees and other penalties.\nIf we exercise the option to acquire equity ownership of Wuge, the ownership transfer may subject us to certain limitation and substantial costs.\nPursuant to the VIE agreements, Makesi WFOE has the exclusive right to purchase all or any part of the equity interests in Wuge from the shareholders of Wuge for a nominal price, unless the relevant government authorities or then applicable PRC laws request that a minimum price amount be used as the purchase price, in such case the purchase price shall be the lowest amount under such request. The shareholders of Wuge will be subject to PRC individual income tax on the difference between the equity transfer price and the then current registered capital of Wuge. Additionally, if such a transfer takes place, the competent tax authority may require Makesi WFOE to pay enterprise income tax for ownership transfer income with reference to the market value, in which case the amount of tax could be substantial.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nPRC regulation of loans to, and direct investments in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using proceeds from future financing activities to make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC operating subsidiaries.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, which replaces the previous SAFE Circular 75. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents, including PRC individuals and PRC corporate entities, to register with SAFE or its local branches in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment activities. SAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our shareholders who are PRC residents and may be applicable to any offshore acquisitions that we may make in the future.\nUnder SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who make, or have prior to the implementation of SAFE Circular 37 made, direct or indirect investments in offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, are required to register such investments with SAFE or its local branches. In addition, any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of an SPV, is required to update its registration with the local branch of SAFE with respect to that SPV, to reflect any material change. Moreover, any subsidiary of such SPV in China is required to urge the PRC resident shareholders to update their registration with the local branch of SAFE to reflect any material change. If any PRC resident shareholder of such SPV fails to make the required registration or to update the registration, the subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited from distributing its profits or the proceeds from any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also be prohibited from making additional capital contributions into its subsidiaries in China. In February, 2015, SAFE promulgated a Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13. Under SAFE Notice 13, applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign direct investments and outbound direct investments, including those required under SAFE Circular 37, must be filed with qualified banks instead of SAFE. Qualified banks should examine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of SAFE. We have used our best efforts to notify PRC residents or entities who directly or indirectly hold shares in our holding company and who are known to us as being PRC residents to complete the foreign exchange registrations. However, we may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor can we compel our beneficial owners to comply with SAFE registration requirements. We cannot assure you that all other shareholders or beneficial owners of ours who are PRC residents or entities have complied with, and will in the future make, obtain or update any applicable registrations or approvals required by, SAFE regulations. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply with SAFE regulations, or failure by us to amend the foreign exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, and limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions or pay dividends to us or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nFurthermore, as these foreign exchange and outbound investment related regulations are relatively new and their interpretation and implementation has been constantly evolving, it is unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border investments and transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we have complied or will be able to comply with all applicable foreign exchange and outbound investment related regulations. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nAs an offshore holding company with PRC subsidiaries, we may finance our subsidiaries by means of loans or capital contributions and finance Wuge by means of loans. Any capital contributions or loans that we, as an offshore entity, make to our Company\u2019s PRC subsidiary and Wuge are subject to the above PRC regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. If we fail to obtain such approvals or make such registration, our ability to make equity contributions or provide loans to our Company\u2019s PRC subsidiary and Wuge or to fund their operations may be negatively affected, which may adversely affect their liquidity and ability to fund their working capital and expansion projects and meet their obligations and commitments. As a result, our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business may be negatively affected.\nChanges in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAll of Wuge\u2019s operations and assets are located in China. Accordingly, Wuge\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally and by continued economic growth in China as a whole.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, and since 2012, China\u2019s economic growth has slowed down. Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our products and services and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a \u201cResident Enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.\nChina passed the Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise.\nOn April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation of China issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation to offshore entities controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a \u201cnon-domestically incorporated resident enterprise\u201d if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate stamps, board and stockholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) all of its directors with voting rights or senior management reside in China. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC stockholders. Because substantially all of our operations and senior management are located within the PRC and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future, we may be considered a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes and therefore subject to the PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its worldwide income. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise controlled by a Chinese natural person. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.\nIf the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Currently, we do not have any non-China source income, as we conduct our sales in China. However, under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would be deemed as \u201cqualified investment income between resident enterprises\u201d and therefore qualify as \u201ctax-exempt income\u201d pursuant to clause 26 of the EIT Law. Second, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification could result in a situation in which the dividends we pay with respect to our common stock, or the gain our non-PRC shareholders may realize from the transfer of our common stock, may be treated as PRC-sourced income and may therefore be subject to a 10% PRC withholding tax. The EIT Law and its implementing regulations are, however, relatively new and ambiguities exist with respect to the interpretation and identification of PRC-sourced income, and the application and assessment of withholding taxes. If we are required under the EIT Law and its implementing regulations to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC shareholders, or if non-PRC stockholders are required to pay PRC income tax on gains on the transfer of their common stock, our business could be negatively impacted and the value of your investment may be materially reduced. Further, if we were treated as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both China and such countries in which we have taxable income, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against such other taxes.\nWe must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits US companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Certain of our suppliers are owned by the PRC government and our dealings with them are likely to be considered to be with government officials for these purposes. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in China. It is our policy to prohibit our employees, and to discourage our agents, representatives and consultants, from engaging in such practices. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage. Our employees, agents, representatives and consultants may not always be subject to our control. If any of them violates FCPA or other anti-corruption law, we might be held responsible. We could suffer severe penalties in that event. In addition, the US government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or which we acquire.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations and changes in policies, rules, and regulations in China, which may be quick with little advance notice, could limit the legal protection available to you and us.\nThe PRC legal system is based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which legal cases have limited value as precedents. In the late 1970s, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The legislation over the past three decades has significantly increased the protection afforded to various forms of foreign or private-sector investment in China. Wuge is subject to various PRC laws and regulations generally applicable to companies in China. Since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, however, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and rules involve uncertainties.\nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, however, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy in the PRC legal system than in more developed legal systems. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies, internal rules, and regulations that may have retroactive effect and may change quickly with little advance notice. As a result, Wuge may not be aware of its violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. Such uncertainties, including uncertainties over the scope and effect of the contractual, property (including intellectual property), and procedural rights, and any failure to respond to changes in the regulatory environment in China could materially and adversely affect Wuge\u2019s business and impede Wuge\u2019s ability to continue its operations.\nOur business may be materially and adversely affected if Wuge declares bankruptcy or become subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding.\nThe Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the PRC, or the Bankruptcy Law, came into effect on June 1, 2007. The Bankruptcy Law provides that an enterprise will be liquidated if the enterprise fails to settle its debts as and when they fall due and if the enterprise\u2019s assets are, or are demonstrably, insufficient to clear such debts.\nWuge holds certain assets that are important to our business operations. If Wuge undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect Wuge\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAccording to SAFE\u2019s Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies for Direct Investment, effective on 17 December 2012, and the Provisions for Administration of Foreign Exchange Relating to Inbound Direct Investment by Foreign Investors, effective May 13, 2013, if any of our PRC subsidiaries undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, prior approval from SAFE for remittance of foreign exchange to our shareholders abroad is no longer required, but we still need to conduct a registration process with the SAFE local branch. It is not clear whether \u201cregistration\u201d is a mere formality or involves the kind of substantive review process undertaken by SAFE and its relevant branches in the past.\nSubstantial uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of the PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.\nThe Ministry of Commerce published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015, or the 2015 FIL Draft, which expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of \u201cactual control\u201d in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. Under the 2015 FIL Draft, VIEs that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as foreign invested enterprises, if they are ultimately \u201ccontrolled\u201d by foreign investors.\nOn March 15, 2019, the National People\u2019s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, or the FIL, which will come into effect on January 1, 2020, repealing simultaneously the Law of the PRC on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Law of the PRC on Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprises and the Law of the PRC on Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. Pursuant to the FIL, foreign investment refers to any investment activity directly or indirectly carried out by foreign natural persons, enterprises, or other organizations, including investment in new construction project, establishment of foreign funded enterprise or increase of investment, merger and acquisition, and investment in any other way stipulated under laws, administrative regulations, or provisions of the State Council. Although the FIL has deleted the particular reference to the concept of \u201cactual control\u201d and contractual arrangements compared to the 2015 FIL Draft, there is still uncertainty regarding whether Wuge would be identified as a FIE in the future.\nEven if Wuge were to be identified as a FIE in the future, we believe that our current business would not be adversely affected. However, if we were to engage in any business conduct involving third parties identified as prohibited or restricted on the Negative List, Wuge as well as its subsidiary may be subject to laws and regulations on foreign investment. In addition, our shareholders would also be prohibited or restricted to invest in certain sectors on the Negative List. However, even if Wuge were to be identified as a FIE, the validity of our contractual arrangements with Wuge and its shareholders as well as our corporate structure would not be adversely affected. We would still be able to receive benefits from Wuge in accordance with the contractual agreements. In addition, as the Chinese government has been updating the Negative List in recent years and reducing the sectors prohibited or restricted for foreign investment, it is probable in the future that, even if Wuge is identified as a FIE, it is still allowed to acquire or hold equity of enterprises in sectors currently prohibited or restricted for foreign investment.\nFurthermore, the PRC Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign invested enterprises established according to the existing laws regulating foreign investment may maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementing of the PRC Foreign Investment Law.\nIn addition, the PRC Foreign Investment Law also provides several protective rules and principles for foreign investors and their investments in the PRC, including, among others, that a foreign investor may freely transfer into or out of China, in Renminbi or a foreign currency, its contributions, profits, capital gains, income from disposition of assets, royalties of intellectual property rights, indemnity or compensation lawfully acquired, and income from liquidation, among others, within China; local governments shall abide by their commitments to the foreign investors; governments at all levels and their departments shall enact local normative documents concerning foreign investment in compliance with laws and regulations and shall not impair legitimate rights and interests, impose additional obligations onto FIEs, set market access restrictions and exit conditions, or intervene with the normal production and operation activities of FIEs; except for special circumstances, in which case statutory procedures shall be followed and fair and reasonable compensation shall be made in a timely manner, expropriation or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited; and mandatory technology transfer is prohibited.\nNotwithstanding the above, the PRC Foreign Investment Law stipulates that foreign investment includes \u201cforeign investors invest through any other methods under laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council\u201d. Therefore, there are possibilities that future laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council may regard contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, and then whether our contractual arrangement will be recognized as foreign investment, whether our contractual arrangement will be deemed to be in violation of the foreign investment access requirements and how the above-mentioned contractual arrangement will be handled are uncertain.\nGiven the Chinese government\u2019s significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of the business of Wuge, the Chinese government may intervene or influence its operations at any time, which could result in a material change in the operations of Wuge and/or the value of our common stock.\nThe Chinese government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of Wuge and may intervene or influence their operations at any time as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political, and societal goals, which could result in a material change in the operations of Wuge and/or the value of our common stock.\nThe Chinese government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and Internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding our industry that could adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of Wuge. Furthermore, if China adopts more stringent standards with respect to certain areas such as environmental protection or corporate social responsibilities, Wuge may incur increased compliance costs or become subject to additional restrictions in their operations. Certain areas of the law in China, including intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections, may also not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. In addition, we cannot predict the effects of future developments in the PRC legal system on the business operations of Wuge, including the promulgation of new laws, or changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us and our investors, including you.\nThe Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities. We are currently not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S exchanges, however, if Wuge or the holding company were required to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on U.S. exchange and the value of our common stock may significantly decline or become worthless, which would materially affect the interest of the investors.\nThe Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Under the current government leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing reform policies which have adversely affected China-based operating companies whose securities are listed in the United States, with significant policies changes being made from time to time without notice. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of our contractual arrangements with borrowers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, bankruptcy or criminal proceedings. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. The central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties.\nGiven recent statements by the Chinese government indicating an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, any such action could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless.\nRecently, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law, or the Opinions, which was made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems, will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions from PRC government authorities in connection with the Opinions.\nOn June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress of China, or the SCNPC, promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect in September 2021. The PRC Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data activities, and introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development, and the degree of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or used. The PRC Data Security Law also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities that may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data an information.\nOn August 17, 2021, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Protection of the Security of Critical Information Infrastructure, or the Regulations, which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Regulations supplement and specify the provisions on the security of critical information infrastructure as stated in the Cybersecurity Review Measures. The Regulations provide, among others, that protection department of certain industry or sector shall notify the operator of the critical information infrastructure in time after the identification of certain critical information infrastructure.\nOn August 20, 2021, the SCNPC promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law of the PRC, or the Personal Information Protection Law, which took effect on November 1, 2021. As the first systematic and comprehensive law specifically for the protection of personal information in the PRC, the Personal Information Protection Law provides, among others, that (i) an individual\u2019s consent shall be obtained to use sensitive personal information, such as biometric characteristics and individual location tracking, (ii) personal information operators using sensitive personal information shall notify individuals of the necessity of such use and impact on the individual\u2019s rights, and (iii) where personal information operators reject an individual\u2019s request to exercise his or her rights, the individual may file a lawsuit with a People\u2019s Court.\nOn December 24, 2021, the CSRC, together with other relevant government authorities in China issued the Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), and the Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (\u201cDraft Overseas Listing Regulations\u201d). The Draft Overseas Listing Regulations requires that a PRC domestic enterprise seeking to issue and list its shares overseas (\u201cOverseas Issuance and Listing\u201d) shall complete the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC. The Overseas Issuance and Listing includes direct and indirect issuance and listing. Where an enterprise whose principal business activities are conducted in PRC seeks to issue and list its shares in the name of an overseas enterprise (\u201cOverseas Issuer\u201d) on the basis of the equity, assets, income or other similar rights and interests of the relevant PRC domestic enterprise, such activities shall be deemed an indirect overseas issuance and listing (\u201cIndirect Overseas Issuance and Listing\u201d) under the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations. Therefore, the proposed offering would be deemed an Indirect Overseas Issuance and Listing under the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations. As such, the Company would be required to complete the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC after the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations become effective.\nAs such, the Company\u2019s businesses may be subject to various government and regulatory interference in the provinces in which they operate. The Company could be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities, including various local and municipal agencies and government sub-divisions. The Company may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time with little advance notice, which could result in a material change in our operations and in the value of our common stock. Any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless.\nFurthermore, it is uncertain when and whether the Company will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges in the future, and even when such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded. Although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC federal or local government to obtain such permission and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry. As a result, our common stock may decline in value dramatically or even become worthless should we become subject to new requirement to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchange in the future.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nChanges in the value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar are affected by, among other things, changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition, and the value of, and any dividends payable on our shares in U.S. dollar terms. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from our public offering into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on RMB amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of paying dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. In addition, fluctuations of the RMB against other currencies may increase or decrease the cost of imports and exports, and thus affect the price-competitiveness of our products against products of foreign manufacturers or products relying on foreign inputs.\nSince July 2005, the RMB is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nIncreases in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe currently effective PRC Labor Contract Law, or the Labor Contract Law was first adopted on June 29, 2007 and later amended on December 28, 2012. The PRC Labor Contract Law has reinforced the protection of employees who, under the Labor Contract Law, have the right, among others, to have written employment contracts, to enter into employment contracts with no fixed term under certain circumstances, to receive overtime wages and to terminate or alter terms in labor contracts. Furthermore, the Labor Contract Law sets forth additional restrictions and increases the costs involved with dismissing employees. To the extent that we need to significantly reduce our workforce, the Labor Contract Law could adversely affect our ability to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, for employees whose employment contracts include noncompetition terms, the Labor Contract Law requires us to pay monthly compensation after such employment is terminated, which will increase our operating expenses.\nWe expect that our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits, will continue to increase. Unless we are able to pass on these increased labor costs to our vehicle buyers by increasing the prices of our products and services, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nPRC regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our PRC subsidiary\u2019s ability to increase its registered capital or distribute profits to us or otherwise expose us or our PRC resident beneficial owners to liability and penalties under PRC law.\nIn July 2014, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange promulgated the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents via Special Purpose Vehicles, or \u201cCircular 37\u201d. According to Circular 37, prior registration with the local SAFE branch is required for Chinese residents to contribute domestic assets or interests to offshore companies, known as Special Purpose Vehicles (\u201cSPVs\u201d). Circular 37 further requires amendment to a PRC resident\u2019s registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the SPV, such as an increase or decrease in the capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division, or other material event. Further, foreign investment enterprises established by way of round-tripping shall complete the relevant foreign exchange registration formalities pursuant to the prevailing foreign exchange control provisions for direct investments by foreign investors, and disclose the relevant information such as actual controlling party of the shareholders truthfully.\nWe may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor can we compel our beneficial owners to comply with SAFE registration requirements. As a result, we cannot assure you that all of our shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC residents or entities have complied with, and will in the future make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals required by, SAFE regulations. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply with SAFE regulations, or failure by us to amend the foreign exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit Makesi WFOE\u2019s ability to make distributions or pay dividends to us or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWuge may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection. Wuge may be required to suspend its business, be liable for improper use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers and face other penalties.\nWuge may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. In particular, there are numerous laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other user data. Such laws and regulations often vary in scope, may be subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions.\nWe expect to obtain information about various aspects of our operations as well as regarding our employees and third parties. We also maintain information about various aspects of our operations as well as regarding our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. We are required by applicable laws to keep strictly confidential the personal information that we collect, and to take adequate security measures to safeguard such information.\nThe PRC Criminal Law, as amended by its Amendment 7 (effective on February 28, 2009) and Amendment 9 (effective on November 1, 2015), prohibits institutions, companies and their employees from selling or otherwise illegally disclosing a citizen\u2019s personal information obtained during the course of performing duties or providing services or obtaining such information through theft or other illegal ways. On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the PRC National People\u2019s Congress issued the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June 1, 2017.\nPursuant to the Cyber Security Law, network operators must not, without users\u2019 consent, collect their personal information, and may only collect users\u2019 personal information necessary to provide their services. Providers are also obliged to provide security maintenance for their products and services and shall comply with provisions regarding the protection of personal information as stipulated under the relevant laws and regulations.\nThe Civil Code of the PRC (issued by the PRC National People\u2019s Congress on May 28, 2020 and effective from January 1, 2021) provides main legal basis for privacy and personal information infringement claims under the Chinese civil laws. PRC regulators, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, MIIT, and the Ministry of Public Security have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of data security and data protection.\nThe PRC regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity are constantly evolving. For instance, various regulatory bodies in China, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Public Security and the SAMR, have enforced data privacy and protection laws and regulations with varying and evolving standards and interpretations. In April 2020, the Chinese government promulgated Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on June 1, 2020. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security.\nIn November 2016, the Standing Committee of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress passed China\u2019s first Cybersecurity Law (\u201cCSL\u201d), which became effective in June 2017. The CSL is the first PRC law that systematically lays out the regulatory requirements on cybersecurity and data protection, subjecting many previously under-regulated or unregulated activities in cyberspace to government scrutiny. The legal consequences of violation of the CSL include penalties of warning, confiscation of illegal income, suspension of related business, winding up for rectification, shutting down the websites, and revocation of business license or relevant permits. In April 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain other PRC regulatory authorities promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective in June 2020. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments (\u201cDraft Measures\u201d), which required that, in addition to \u201coperator of critical information infrastructure,\u201d any \u201cdata processor\u201d carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security should also be subject to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated the factors to be considered when assessing the national security risks of the relevant activities, including, among others, (i) the risk of core data, important data or a large amount of\u202f personal information being stolen, leaked, destroyed, and illegally used or exited the country; and (ii) the risk of critical information infrastructure, core data, important data or a large amount of personal information being affected, controlled, or maliciously used by foreign governments after listing abroad. The Cyberspace Administration of China has said that under the proposed rules companies holding data on more than 1,000,000 users must now apply for cybersecurity approval when seeking listings in other nations because of the risk that such data and personal information could be \u201caffected, controlled, and maliciously exploited by foreign governments,\u201d The cybersecurity review will also investigate the potential national security risks from overseas IPOs. We do not know what regulations will be adopted or how such regulations will affect us and our listing on Nasdaq. In the event that the Cyberspace Administration of China determines that we are subject to these regulations, we may be required to delist from Nasdaq and we may be subject to fines and penalties. On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the NPC promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law also sets forth the data security protection obligations for entities and individuals handling personal data, including that no entity or individual may acquire such data by stealing or other illegal means, and the collection and use of such data should not exceed the necessary limits The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, CSL and any other cybersecurity and related laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business. On January 4, 2022, thirteen PRC regulatory agencies, namely, the CAC, the NDRC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Finance, MOFCOM, SAMR, CSRC, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the National Radio and Television Administration, National Administration of State Secrets Protection and the National Cryptography Administration, jointly adopted and published the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), which became effective on February 15, 2022. The Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) required that, among others, in addition to \u201coperator of critical information infrastructure\u201d any \u201coperator of network platform\u201d holding personal information of more than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange should also be subject to cybersecurity review.\nOn July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments (the \u201cReview Measures\u201d), and on December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China jointly with the relevant authorities published Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) which took effect on February 15, 2022 and replace the Review Measures, which required that, operators of critical information infrastructure purchasing network products and services, and data processors (together with the operators of critical information infrastructure, the \u201cOperators\u201d) carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review, any operator who controls more than one million users\u2019 personal information must go through a cybersecurity review by the cybersecurity review office if it seeks to be listed in a foreign country.\nUnder the Data Security Law enacted on September 1, 2021 and the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) implemented on February 15, 2022, given that (i) Wuge is not an Operator, (Ii) Wuge does not possess more than one million users\u2019 personal information, and (iIi) data processed in Wuge\u2019s business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities. However, if the CSRC, CAC or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for this offering and any follow-on offering, we may be unable to obtain such approvals and we may face sanctions by the CSRC, CAC or other PRC regulatory agencies for failure to seek their approval which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to our investors and the securities currently being offered may substantially decline in value and be worthless.\nWe cannot assure you that PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, would take the same view as we do, and there is no assurance that we can fully or timely comply with such laws. In the event that we are subject to any mandatory cybersecurity review and other specific actions required by the CAC, we face uncertainty as to whether any clearance or other required actions can be timely completed, or at all. Given such uncertainty, we may be further required to suspend our relevant business, shut down our website, or face other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, this offering and our reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our common stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nRecently, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our Company, our business and this offering. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend the Company. This situation may be a major distraction to our management. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our Company and business operations will be severely hampered and your investment in our common stock could be rendered worthless.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests and exercising your rights as a stockholder since we conduct substantially all of our operations in China, and almost all of our officers and directors reside outside the U.S.\nAlthough we are incorporated in Nevada, we conduct substantially all of our operations in China. All of our current officers and almost all of our directors reside outside the U.S. and substantially all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the U.S. It may be difficult for you to conduct due diligence on the Company or such directors in your election of the directors and attend shareholders meeting if the meeting is held in China. We plan to have one shareholder meeting each year at a location to be determined, potentially in China. As a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation doing business entirely or predominantly within the U.S.\nThe recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. Although the audit report included in annual report was issued by U.S. auditors who are currently inspected by the PCAOB, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors would be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our common stock may be delisted or prohibited from trading.\nOn April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement emphasized the risks associated with lack of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in emerging markets.\nOn May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals with the SEC to (i) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating in \u201cRestrictive Market\u201d, (ii) adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or board of director for Restrictive Market companies, and (iii) apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the company\u2019s auditors.\nOn May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requiring a foreign company to certify it is not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. If the PCAOB is unable to inspect the company\u2019s auditors for three consecutive years, the issuer\u2019s securities are prohibited to trade on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. On December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law.\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure requirements of the Act. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. The SEC will implement a process for identifying such a registrant and any such identified registrant will be required to submit documentation to the SEC establishing that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction, and will also require disclosure in the registrant\u2019s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence on, such a registrant.\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill which, if passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act from three years to two.\nThe lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the auditors based in China. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms\u2019 audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause existing and potential investors in our stock to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements.\nOn December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions.\nOn December 16, 2021, PCAOB announced the PCAOB Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act determinations (the \u201cPCAOB determinations\u201d) relating to the PCAOB\u2019s inability to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China of the PRC or Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in the PRC or Hong Kong.\nThe lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the auditors based in China. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms\u2019 audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause existing and potential investors in our stock to lose confidence in our audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements.\nOur auditor, WWC, P.C., the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report in this annual report, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess our auditor\u2019s compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is headquartered in San Mateo, California, and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis. Therefore, we believe that, as of the date of this annual report, our auditor is not subject to the determinations as to the inability to inspect or investigate registered firms completely announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021.\nHowever, these recent developments would add uncertainties to our offering, and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial statements. In the event it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely the Company\u2019s auditor because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction, then such lack of inspection could cause trading in the Company\u2019s securities to be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and ultimately result in a determination by a securities exchange to delist the Company\u2019s securities.\nThe M&A Rules and certain other PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nThe Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in August 2006 and amended in 2009, and some other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOC be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. For example, the M&A Rules require that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the SCNPC effective in 2008 requires that transactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds (i.e., during the previous fiscal year, (i) the total global turnover of all operators participating in the transaction exceeds RMB10 billion and at least two of these operators each had a turnover of more than RMB400 million within China, or (ii) the total turnover within China of all the operators participating in the concentration exceeded RMB 2 billion, and at least two of these operators each had a turnover of more than RMB 400 million within China) must be cleared by MOFCOM before they can be completed.\nMoreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law requires that the MOC shall be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. In addition, the security review rules issued by the MOC that became effective in September 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise \u201cnational defense and security\u201d concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise \u201cnational security\u201d concerns are subject to strict review by the MOC, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOC or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nIf Wuge fails to maintain the requisite licenses and approvals required under PRC law, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nForeign investment is highly regulated by the PRC government and local authorities. Wuge is required to obtain and maintain certain licenses or approvals from different regulatory authorities in order to operate their respective current businesses. These licenses and approvals are essential to the operation of their businesses, for example, the value-added telecommunication business carried out by Wuge. If Wuge fails to obtain or maintain any of the required licenses or approvals for its business, we may be subject to various penalties, such as fines and the discontinuation or restriction of its operations. Any such disruption in the business operations of Wuge could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions against us or our management, in China, based upon United States laws, including the U.S. federal securities laws, or other foreign laws.\nWe are a company incorporated in Nevada. Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China, and substantially all of our assets are located in China. All of our current directors and officers reside in China, and substantially all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons, or to enforce judgments against us which are obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\nThe recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the United States providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors or officers if they decide that the judgment violates the basic principles of PRC laws, national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nIn the event shareholders originate an action against a company without domicile in China for disputes related to contracts or other property interests, the PRC courts may accept a cause of action if (a) the disputed contract is concluded or performed in the PRC or the disputed subject matter is located in the PRC, (b) the company (as defendant) has properties that can be seized within the PRC, (c) the company has a representative organization within the PRC, or (d) the parties chose to submit to the jurisdiction of the PRC courts in the contract on the condition that such submission does not violate the requirements of jurisdiction under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. The action may be initiated by the shareholder by filing a complaint with the PRC courts. The PRC courts would determine whether to accept the complaint in accordance with the PRC Civil Procedures Law. The shareholder may participate in the action by itself or entrust any other person or PRC legal counsel to participate on behalf of such shareholder. Foreign citizens and companies will have the same rights as PRC citizens and companies in such an action unless such foreign country restricts the rights of PRC citizens and companies.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may be further adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and confirmed cases were also reported in other parts of the world. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization\u2019s \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government.\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the offices of our then subsidiaries Shengrong Environmental Protection Technology (Wuhan) Co., Ltd. (\u201cShengrong WFOE\u201d) and Wuhan HOST Coating Materials Co., Ltd. (\u201cWuhan HOST\u201d) in Hubei Province, China were closed on January 23, 2020 to adhere to the emergency quarantine measures required by local governments. The economic disruption caused by COVID-19 were catastrophic to the coating material business of Shengrong WFOE and Wuhan HOST, which had no revenue and negative operating income since the fourth quarter of 2019 and no revenue or operating income for the first and second quarter of 2020. Shengrong WFOE and Wuhan HOST lost employees, suppliers and customers and were not able to recover. As a result, we sold our businesses located in Wuhan in June 2020. For more details, please see \u201cItem 1. Business - Corporate History and Structure - Disposition of China Sunlong\u201d.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation in China remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result could adversely affect our stock price and create more volatility.\nWuge has limited operating histories, which make it difficult to evaluate their businesses and prospects.\nWuge commenced operation in October 2019 and started its digital door sign business in March 2021. We cannot guarantee whether Wuge will continue to generate revenue. You should consider the future prospects of Wuge in light of the risks and uncertainties experienced by early stage companies in evolving industries. Wuge\u2019s limited history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations. Wuge\u2019s operations are subject to all of the risks, challenges, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the operation of any new business, as well as those risks that are specific to the coal trading industry. Investors should evaluate us in light of the problems and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies attempting to develop markets for new products and technologies. Despite the best efforts, Wuge may never overcome these obstacles.\nWuge will continue to encounter risks and difficulties that companies at a similar stage of development frequently experience, including the potential failure to:\n\u25cf obtain sufficient working capital and increase its registered capital to support expansion of our industrial and mining recycling business;\n\u25cf comply with any changes in the laws and regulations of the PRC or local province that may affect our operations;\n\u25cf expand our customer base;\n\u25cf maintain adequate control of default risks and expenses allowing us to realize anticipated revenue growth;\n\u25cf implement our growth strategies and plans and adapt and modify them as needed;\n\u25cf integrate any future business combinations; and\n\u25cf anticipate and adapt to changing conditions and regulations applicable to Wuge\u2019s business in China.\nIf Wuge is unable to address any or all of the foregoing risks, Wuge\u2019s business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWuge may be unable to gain any significant market acceptance for our products and services or be unable to establish a significant market presence.\nWuge\u2019s growth strategy for is substantially dependent upon Wuge\u2019s ability to market the digital door signs and accompanying services successfully to prospective customers in China. This requires that we heavily rely upon Wuge\u2019s development and marketing partners. Failure to select the right development and marketing partners will significantly delay or prohibit our ability to develop our intended products and services, market the products and gain market acceptance. Wuge\u2019s intended products and services may not achieve significant market acceptance. If acceptance is achieved, it may not be sustained for any significant period of time. Failure of Wuge\u2019s intended products and services to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and the results of Wuge\u2019s operations.\nIf Wuge fails to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, we will not generate sufficient revenue, if at all, and our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWuge may never gain significant acceptance in the market and, therefore, may never generate substantial revenue or allow us to achieve or maintain profitability. Adoption of Wuge\u2019s digital door sign in China depends on many factors, including acceptance by users, adaptation of the technology and general consumer behavior in connection with E-commerce. Our ability to achieve commercial market acceptance for Wuge or any other future products also depends on the strength of our sales, marketing and distribution organizations.\nCyber security risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt its operations.\nThe threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, Wuge\u2019s products and technologies and those of third parties that Wuge uses in the operations are vulnerable to cyber security risks, including cyber attacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and computer systems or those of third parties that Wuge uses in the operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, and loss of consumer confidence.\nIn addition, we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire sensitive information or company assets. Despite our efforts to create security barriers to such threats, Wuge may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Any cyber attack that attempts to obtain our data and assets, disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could adversely affect Wuge\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation.\nAny assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject Wuge to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses and its business could be harmed.\nThe technology industries involving IoT devices, software and services are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Much of this litigation involves patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own patent portfolio may provide little or no deterrence.\nWe cannot assure you that Wuge will prevail in any future intellectual property infringement or other litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays, or require Wuge to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, Wuge could be obligated to indemnify our customers against third parties\u2019 claims of intellectual property infringement based on Wuge\u2019s products or solutions. If Wuge\u2019s products or solutions violate any third-party intellectual property rights, Wuge could be required to withdraw them from the market, re-develop them or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any efforts to re-develop Wuge\u2019s products or solutions, obtain licenses from third parties on favorable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase the costs and harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Withdrawal of any of the products or solutions from the market could harm Wuge\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to manage Wuge effectively since its acquisition could materially impact our business.\nThe recent acquisition of Wuge have placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on the Company\u2019s management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. The Company\u2019s success will depend in part on its ability to manage Wuge effectively. To manage the recent and expected growth of its operations and personnel, the Company will need to continue to improve its operational, financial and management controls and its reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage Wuge could result in difficulty or delays in deploying the Company\u2019s services to customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business performance and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nVolatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.\nThe market for our common stock may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that the price of our shares of common stock may continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities to the Company and could divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe will need additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may have to discontinue our operations entirely.\nRegardless of the success of this offering, we will require additional capital in the future. We have incurred losses in each year since our inception. If we continue to use cash at our historical rates of use we will need significant additional financing, which we may seek through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of any such offerings may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect the then existing shareholders rights. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt or making capital expenditures. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nRaising additional capital by issuing shares may cause dilution to existing shareholders.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2022, we had [38,429,617] shares of common stock issued and outstanding.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of any such offerings may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect the then existing shareholders rights. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt or making capital expenditures. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFuture sales of our common stock could reduce the market price of the common stock.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Sales by us or our security holders of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur in the future, could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nThe issuance of any additional shares of our common stock or any securities that are exercisable for or convertible into our common stock, may have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock and will have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders and holders of common stock.\nWe do not know whether a market for the common stock will be sustained or what the trading price of the common stock will be and as a result it may be difficult for you to sell your shares.\nAlthough our common stock trade on Nasdaq, an active trading market for the common stock may not be sustained. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares without depressing the market price for the common stock. As a result of these and other factors, you may not be able to sell your shares. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling common stock, or may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares as consideration.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends on our shares, and you may not receive funds without selling the shares.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any additional future earnings to finance our operations and growth and, therefore, we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock at this time. Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, any contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of the shares in order to generate cash from your investment. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell the shares and may lose the entire amount of your investment.\nA possible \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to additional price volatility.\nHistorically there has not been a large short position in our common stock. However, in the future investors may purchase shares of our common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent an aggregate short exposure in our common stock becomes significant, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to purchase shares for delivery to share lenders at times if and when the price of our common stock increases significantly, particularly over a short period of time. Those purchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to our business prospects, financial performance or other traditional measures of value for the Company or its common stock.\nWe have granted participation rights which could affect our ability to raise funds.\nPursuant to the securities purchase agreement with the investors from the February 2021 Offering, we granted such investors participation rights with respect to issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents within 12 months after the date of the securities purchase agreement. This participation right could delay, limit or hinder our ability to enter into equity financings and to raise funds from third parties.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable law, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements. Such reduced disclosure may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Item 10 of the Regulation S-K, we will elect to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the ability to include only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure. Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 15664, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "CCNC"}
