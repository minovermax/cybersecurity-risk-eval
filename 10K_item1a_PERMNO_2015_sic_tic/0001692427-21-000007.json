{"cik": "1692427", "company": "NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nDescribed below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\n\ufeff\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price have been negatively impacted and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\ufeff\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price have been negatively impacted and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the decline in market conditions primarily related to COVID-19 which has spread from China to many other countries including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency. The pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures.\n\ufeff\nThe demand for crude oil has been materially reduced as a result of such measures taken by governments around the world, which has resulted in excess supply of crude oil and a rapid and material reduction in crude oil prices. As a result, E&P companies responded by significantly reducing their capital expenditure for 2020, resulting in significant reductions in drilling and completion activity, which led to a decrease in demand by our customers for our products and services for the year. In 2021, E&P companies have announced planned capital expenditure budgets that target maintaining production at levels consistent with late 2020, resulting in modest year-over year reductions in capital spending. For as long as we remain in a low commodity price environment, we would generally expect our customers and potential customers to continue to operate at these lower levels of drilling, completion and other production activities or, if conditions worsen, they may further reduce their capital expenditures. These lower capital expenditure levels have resulted in and will continue to result in a reduction in spending on our products and services and impact the prices we are able to charge our customers. Furthermore, if any of our significant customers decides not to continue to use our products and services, or if any of our key suppliers experiences a significant disruption that limits our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAlthough we believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (defined below) will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case, particularly if the decline in market conditions primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for crude oil, customer spending and the resulting demand for our products and services continues for an extended period of time or worsens. These negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are likely to continue to have a material negative impact on our financial performance, which could result in a breach of the covenants and a default under the Amended Credit Agreement (defined below). In the event of a default, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings under the facility immediately due and payable. In addition, the total amount available to be drawn under our Senior Secured Credit Facility is substantially lower than the commitments due to borrowing limits imposed by our borrowing base that is calculated based on eligible receivables, which does not include receivables at Repeat Precision, and the amount available may decline if our business\ncontinues to be materially adversely impacted by the decline in market conditions primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a reduction in liquidity as a result of a default under the Amended Credit Agreement or the reduction of our borrowing capacity as result of business conditions, we may not be able to obtain liquidity from additional indebtedness, the capital markets or otherwise on reasonable terms, or at all, and our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our debt obligations or capital requirements.\n\ufeff\nWe are considered a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Although we have continued to operate our facilities to date consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, the COVID-19 pandemic and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities may have a material adverse effect on our operations, supply chain, customers and transportation networks, including business shutdowns or disruptions. To date, we have experienced delays in importation of certain chemical products from China, and temporary work-from-home orders have reduced operating capacity at the Repeat Precision machine shop operations in Mexico. We have also experienced delays in access to certain materials and products utilized in our research and development activities, which has led, and may continue to lead to delays in new product introductions. Work-from-home orders and other restrictions have also led to delays in planned work in Argentina and China.\n\ufeff\nOn March 31 and April 1, 2020, we also implemented, as of such date, a workforce reduction resulting in termination of over 80 employees, temporary furloughs for certain employees and lower compensation levels for executives and employees not participating in furloughs and on May 4, 2020 and in July 2020, we implemented, as of such date, additional workforce reductions resulting in the termination of approximately 50 employees per each reduction in response to the current difficult market conditions primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the recent fall in demand for, and the price of, crude oil and reductions in customer capital spending plans. The reductions result in the loss of longer-term employees, institutional knowledge and expertise and the reallocation and combination of certain roles and responsibilities across the organization. These reductions, or others which may be caused by, but not limited to, the temporary inability of our workforce to work due to illness, quarantine, or government action, may negatively impact our operations.\n\ufeff\nThe increase in certain of our employees working remotely has amplified certain information technology risks to our business and increased the demand on our information technology resources and systems, including increased phishing and other cyber security attacks as cybercriminals attempt to exploit uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, including laptops and mobile devices, to be secured. Any failure to effectively manage these risks, including to identify and appropriately respond to any cyberattacks, may adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the pandemic and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Any resulting financial impact cannot be estimated reasonably at this time, but may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession or depression. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial results and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below.\n\ufeff\nOur business depends on the levels of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry and particularly on the level of E&P activity within Canada and the United States.\n\ufeff\nDemand for our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers\u2019 views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to our customers\u2019 views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and natural gas prices could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 materially reduced the demand for crude oil and natural gas as a result of measures taken by governments around the world to mitigate the spread of the disease, which lead to a decline in commodity prices. The low commodity price environment resulted in a reduction in the drilling, completion and other production activities of most of our customers and a reduction in their spending on our products and services. The reduction in demand from our customers reduced the prices we were able to charge our customers for our products and services. Although oil pricing has improved since mid-2020, oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, and prolonged reductions in oil and natural gas prices have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, more stable or higher commodity prices do not necessarily translate to a higher level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. For example, in recent years, investors in E&P companies have been prioritizing free cash flow and return of capital to shareholders over production growth, leading to lower expenditures. In addition, E&P companies require significant capital to drill and complete wells and it is becoming increasingly difficult to access capital. These trends may continue, even if commodity prices were to increase.\n\ufeff\nMany factors over which we have no control affect the supply of and demand for, and our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas, and therefore, influence demand levels and prices for our products and services, including:\n\u00b7\nthe domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas E&P;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe expected decline rates of current production;\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u00b7\nregional or global health epidemics;\n\u00b7\nspeculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts;\n\u00b7\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u00b7\nthe discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u00b7\ncontractions in the credit market;\n\u00b7\nthe strength or weakness of the United States Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d);\n\u00b7\navailable pipeline and other transportation capacity;\n\u00b7\nthe levels of oil and natural gas storage;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental approvals and regulatory requirements and conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including military action in the Middle East;\n\u00b7\ntechnical advances affecting energy demand, generation and consumption;\n\u00b7\nthe proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u00b7\nalternative fuel requirements or technological advances and the demand and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u00b7\nfuel conservation measures;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n\u00b7\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers; and\n\u00b7\noverall domestic and global economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. Any of the above factors could impact the level of oil and natural gas E&P activity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the macro commodity price environment, our current or prospective customers may experience certain constraints that disproportionately impact their business and reduce their expenditures. During the second half of 2018, our Canadian customers experienced a widening of oil price differentials due to pipeline constraints which continued through the end of 2019 and are expected to continue well into the future. Drilling and completion activity in the U.S. and Canada fell in 2019 as compared to 2018 and fell again in 2020 as compared to 2019. E&P capital budgets which have been announced for 2021 indicate a slight reduction in activity as compared to 2020. Further, should a low commodity price environment impact our customers\u2019 expenditures, we could encounter difficulties such as an inability to access needed capital on attractive terms or at all, the incurrence of further impairment charges, a reduction in our borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, a need to reduce our capital spending and other similar impacts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe cyclicality of the oil and natural gas industry may cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\n\ufeff\nWe derive our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas E&P industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. Prices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. During the past five years, the posted West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) price for oil has ranged from a low of $(36.98) per barrel, or Bbl, in April 2020 to a high of $77.41 per Bbl in June 2018. Over the same period, the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.33 per million British thermal units, or MMBtu, in September 2020 to a high of $6.24 per MMBtu in January 2018. We have, and may in the future, experience significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices. For example, prolonged low commodity prices experienced by the oil and natural gas industry during 2015 and 2016, combined with adverse changes in the capital and credit markets, caused many E&P companies to reduce their capital budgets and drilling activity. This resulted in a significant decline in demand for oilfield services and adversely impacted the prices oilfield services companies could charge for their services. We have master services agreements (\u201cMSAs\u201d) with most of our customers which have no minimum purchase requirements. As a result, a large portion of our customers are not obligated to buy our products or utilize our services for an extended period or at all.\n\ufeff\nLow commodity price environments can negatively impact oil and natural gas E&P companies and, in some cases, impair their ability to timely pay for products or services provided or can result in their insolvency or bankruptcy, any of which exposes us to credit risk of our oil and natural gas E&P customers.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, many of whose operations may be concentrated in certain markets which, as described above, are subject to volatility and, therefore, credit risk. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we are unable to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, in weak economic and commodity price environments, we may experience difficulties, delays or failures in collecting outstanding receivables from many customers, due to, among other reasons, a reduction in their cash flow from operations, their inability to access the credit markets and, in certain cases, their insolvencies. In 2020, lower commodity prices impacted E&P companies that carry significant debt on their balance sheets and companies that rely on liquidity from loans that are based on the value of their oil and gas reserves. There have been several Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings by E&P companies through the year, and the credit quality of the upstream oil and natural gas sector, our customer base, has been negatively impacted by the decline in market conditions, primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Further, laws in some jurisdictions in which we operate could make collection unlikely, difficult or time consuming. Such collection issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nTo the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with these customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code and similar international laws, or may be renegotiated. Further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of increasing sales of our products and services for use in basins located in the United States.\n\ufeff\nA key component of our growth strategy is to increase our market share in the United States. We sell a variety of products and services in the United States, including our fracturing systems, well construction, tracer diagnostic services and composite frac plugs and related products through Repeat Precision. In many of the product and service categories, we have been selling in the United States for a shorter period of time than we have been selling in Canada and thus must convince potential customers about either the value of the emerging technology compared to traditional methods or, in the case of more mature technology offerings, our differentiated benefits.\n\ufeff\nOur primary offering is our fracturing systems products and services. Currently, most E&P companies in the United States rely on traditional well completion techniques and do not utilize pinpoint stimulation. In many circumstances, it has been and may continue to be difficult convincing potential customers of the benefits of our technologies relative to traditional well completion techniques, whether it be for more specific targeted uses or widespread adoption. If we are unable to convince potential customers in the United States of the benefits of pinpoint stimulation, our strategy to increase the level of sales of our products and services in the United States would be negatively impacted, harming our growth prospects. Additionally, the sales of our products and services depend in large part on the perception of pinpoint stimulation in the oil and natural gas industry. Unfavorable industry reports or poor well performance for wells that were completed using pinpoint stimulation would harm the perception of pinpoint stimulation and technological advances in traditional well completion techniques have made, and could continue to make, it more difficult to convince\npotential customers to adopt pinpoint stimulation, which could impact our ability to grow our U.S. sales and harm our growth prospects. In other product and service categories, we often compete in markets with many other competitors which may make it difficult to increase market share in the United States, as further described in the risk factor below.\n\ufeff\nCompetition within our industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\n\ufeff\nThe markets in which we operate are generally highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in our market are technology, service quality, safety track record and price. We compete with large national and multi-national companies that have substantially longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. These companies may be able to charge lower prices for competing products and services, particularly if a company maintains a lower cost structure by investing in less research and development activities. These products and services offered by lower-priced competitors may be more attractive to our customers in lower commodity price environments, even if the products or services offered are inferior. Also, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, products and services and changes in customer requirements. These responses may come from direct competitors who offer similar products or services or competitors who offer substitutes. In certain circumstances, work is awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded the work. The competitive environment may be further intensified when oil and gas companies reduce their expenditures, as has been occurring in the current lower commodity price environment, leading to excess capacity and additional pricing pressure. Further, as a result of the significant reduced demand for oil and natural gas services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our competitors may engage in bankruptcy proceedings, debt refinancing transactions, management changes, or other strategic initiatives in an attempt to reduce operating costs to maintain a position in the market. In addition, mergers and acquisitions among oil and natural gas companies or other events that have the effect of reducing the number of available customers may make the environment more competitive. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our current products or services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nA single customer constituted 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 8% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The loss of that customer or any other of our significant customers, or their failure to pay the amounts they owe us, could cause our revenue to decline substantially.\n\ufeff\nOur largest customer is Crescent Point which accounted for approximately 10% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 8% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, our top five customers accounted for approximately 31%, 22% and 24% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from these customers in the near future. There has been an increase in consolidation amongst E&P companies and, as a result, we have experienced a reduction in spending with certain large customers and may continue to further experience a reduction in future business with consolidating customers if combined capital spending is reduced, if procurement strategies are altered, or if the counterparty in the consolidation has other preferred vendors for the products and services we have been providing. If any large customers decided not to continue to use our products and services for any reason, our revenue would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our customer base. Any nonperformance by these customers, including their failure to pay the amounts they owe us, either as a result of changes in general financial and economic conditions, conditions in the oil and natural gas industry or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and implement new technologies, products and services.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends on the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs and improvements, and on our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, if we are not able to obtain patent or other intellectual property protection of our technology, we may not be able to recoup development costs or fully exploit systems, services and technologies in a manner that allows us to meet evolving industry requirements at prices acceptable to our customers. In 2020, we implemented several cost reduction measures, including several workforce reductions resulting in the termination of many employees. These measures resulted in the loss of longer-term employees, institutional knowledge and expertise and may negatively impact our ability to develop or implement new technologies. In addition, some of our competitors are large national and multinational companies that may be able to devote greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources to research and development of new systems, services and technologies than we are able to do.\n\ufeff\nInvestments in new technologies involve uncertainties and risk. Commercial success depends on many factors, including the levels of innovation, the development costs and the availability of capital resources to fund those costs, the levels of competition from\nothers developing similar or other competing technologies, our ability to obtain or maintain government permits or certifications, the effectiveness of production, distribution and marketing efforts, and the costs to customers to deploy and provide support for the new technologies. In addition, it may take long periods of time to develop new technologies and we may not accurately predict the future needs of our customers or the competitive landscape. We may not achieve significant revenues from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAdvancements in drilling and well completion technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nOur industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As new well completion technologies develop, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressure may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. We may not be able to successfully acquire or use new technologies. New technologies, services or standards, including improvements to existing competing technologies, could render our technologies, products or services obsolete, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether or that replace our technologies, could cause a decline in the demand for the products and services that we provide and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur competitors may infringe upon, misappropriate, violate or challenge the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property and we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in the future. We may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights.\n\ufeff\nWe currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and have multiple pending patent applications for products and processes. Patent rights give the owner of a patent the right to exclude third parties from making, using, selling, and offering for sale the inventions claimed in the patents in the applicable country. Patent rights do not necessarily grant the owner of a patent the right to practice the invention claimed in a patent, but merely the right to exclude others from practicing the invention claimed in the patent. It may be possible for a third-party to design around our patents. Furthermore, patent rights have strict territorial limits. We may not be able to enforce our patents against infringement occurring in \u201cnon-covered\u201d territories. Also, we do not have patents in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business and our patent portfolio will not protect all aspects of our business and may relate to obsolete or unusual methods, which would not prevent third parties from entering the same market.\n\ufeff\nDespite our efforts to safeguard our intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so, or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and other third parties to produce products based on our patented or proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights, providing increased competition and pricing pressure, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, by customarily entering into employment, confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers and potential customers and suppliers, we attempt to limit access to and distribution of our technology. Our rights in our confidential information, trade secrets, and confidential know-how will not prevent third parties from independently developing similar information. Publicly available information (e.g. information in expired issued patents, published patent applications, and scientific literature) can also be used by third parties to independently develop technology. This independently developed technology may be equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology.\n\ufeff\nConfidential information shared with employees, customers and potential customers and suppliers may be used by those parties in a manner inconsistent with their employment, confidentiality and/or license agreements and we may not be able to adequately protect against or stop such behavior. We may not be able to determine if competitive technology offered by third parties was independently developed or resulted from breach of our agreements. In addition, we operate in certain jurisdictions with a heightened risk of misappropriation or misuse of confidential information and intellectual property and it may be more difficult in such jurisdictions to enforce our rights.\n\ufeff\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, become involved in legal proceedings from time to time to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, third parties from time to time may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any legal proceedings related to such claims, and our products and services may be found to infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. If we are sued for infringement and lose, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or\nbe enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Likewise, if we do not prevail in the lawsuits initiated by us, it could impact the strength or validity of the patents in question. Any legal proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly and is inherently unpredictable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation, regardless of its outcome.\n\ufeff\nOur products are used in operations that are subject to potential hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including claims for personal injury and property damage, and, as a result, we are exposed to potential liabilities that may affect our financial condition and reputation.\n\ufeff\nOur products are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications in the oil and natural gas industry where an accident or a failure of a product can potentially have catastrophic consequences. Risks inherent to these applications, such as equipment malfunctions and failures, equipment misuse and defects, explosions, blowouts and uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids and natural disasters can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, damage to formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to or destruction of property, surface water and drinking water resources, equipment and the environment. If our products or services fail to meet specifications or are involved in accidents or failures, we could face warranty, contract or other litigation claims, which could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damages. We operate with most of our customers under MSAs. We endeavor to allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties in MSAs, which may result in material liability to us. In addition, despite our intention to generally allocate risk under MSAs, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into an MSA with terms that are unfavorable to us. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, the frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues. In addition, these risks may be greater for us because we may acquire companies that have not allocated significant resources and management focus to safety and have a poor safety record requiring rehabilitative efforts during the integration process and we may incur liabilities for losses before such rehabilitation occurs.\n\ufeff\nLosses and liabilities from operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\n\ufeff\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all liabilities. Our operations are subject to significant hazards often found in the oil and natural gas industry. Claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations occur in the ordinary course of business in the well services industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our products and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. As described in the risk factor above, our MSAs may require us to indemnify our customers for damage or loss arising out of our sale of goods or performance of our work, regardless of fault, and provide for warranties for products and workmanship and we may also be required to name the customer and others as an additional insured under our insurance policies. We maintain limited insurance coverage against these and other risks associated with our business. Any insurance obtained by us may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities and, particularly in the event that we must submit larger claims to insurance providers, this insurance may not continue to be available at all or on terms which are acceptable to us. Insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Moreover, even if we are successful in defending a claim, it could be time-consuming and costly to defend. Furthermore, the operational insurance coverage we maintain for our business may not fully insure us against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. For example, our insurance does not typically cover losses and liabilities related to intellectual property or general breach of contract claims. In addition, our insurance may not cover losses associated with pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe growth of our business through acquisitions or strategic partnerships exposes us to various risks, including identifying suitable opportunities and integrating businesses, assets and personnel.\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate and pursue acquisitions on a regular basis in order to expand and diversify our business. We may also form strategic partnerships with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. We may not be able to identify any potential acquisition or strategic partnership candidates, consummate any acquisitions or enter into any strategic partnerships and any future acquisitions or strategic partnerships may not be successfully integrated or may not be advantageous to us. In addition, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient capital resources to complete any acquisitions. Entities we acquire may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipate or their liabilities may exceed our expectations. We could face integration issues pertaining to the internal controls and operational functions of the acquired companies and we also could fail to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates. Client dissatisfaction or performance problems\nwith a particular acquired entity or resulting from a strategic partnership could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as a whole. We may be unable to profitably manage any acquired entities, or we may fail to integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions or any of the strategic partnerships we form. In addition, business acquisitions and strategic partnerships involve a number of risks that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nour ability to integrate operational, accounting and technology policies, processes and systems and the implementation of those policies and procedures;\n\u00b7\nour ability to integrate personnel and human resources systems as well as the cultures of each of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nour ability to implement our business plan for the acquired business;\n\u00b7\ntransition of operations, users and clients to our existing platforms or the integration of data, systems and technology platforms with ours;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with regulatory requirements and avoiding potential conflicts of interest in markets that we serve;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain or replace key personnel;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the acquired business or a strategic partner and further develop the acquired business or the business of our strategic partner;\n\u00b7\nour ability to cross-sell our products and services of the acquired businesses or strategic partners to our respective clients;\n\u00b7\nentry into unfamiliar markets;\n\u00b7\nassumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities and/or negative publicity related to prior acts by the acquired entity;\n\u00b7\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, clients, former stockholders or third parties;\n\u00b7\nmisuse of intellectual property by our strategic partners;\n\u00b7\ndisagreements with strategic partners or a misalignment of incentives within any strategic partnership;\n\u00b7\nbecoming subject to increased regulation as a result of an acquisition;\n\u00b7\nbecoming significantly leveraged as a result of incurring debt to finance an acquisition;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities; and\n\u00b7\nimpairment of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill, and dilution to our earnings per share.\n\ufeff\nIf we fail to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire or strategic partnerships that we enter into, we may not realize any of the benefits we anticipate in connection with the acquisitions or partnerships, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nA significant amount of our revenue generated is denominated in the Canadian dollar and could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations.\n\ufeff\nBecause approximately 45% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was generated in Canada, we could be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Canadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d), could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. As we have a trade accounts receivable balance in Canadian dollars of $13.2 million CAD as of December 31, 2020, a 10% increase in the strength of the Canadian dollar versus USD would result in an increase in pre-tax income of $1.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in the strength of the Canadian dollar would have resulted in a comparable decrease in pre-tax income. We have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, as a result, could incur significant and unanticipated translation gains and losses.\n\ufeff\nWe conduct a portion of our operations through the Repeat Precision joint venture, which subjects us to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and the ability of Repeat Precision to make cash distributions to us, which could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe conduct a portion of our operations through the Repeat Precision joint venture and may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. Our joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example, that we may:\n\u00b7\nShare certain approval rights over certain major decisions and may not be able to fully control decisions, including cash distributions to us from the joint venture, which totaled $17.6 million in 2020;\n\u00b7\nDevote significant management time to the requirements of, and matters relating to, the joint ventures;\n\u00b7\nEngage in disputes that may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses;\n\u00b7\nIncur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our joint venture partner, including leaving us liable for the other joint venture partners\u2019 shares of joint venture liabilities;\n\u00b7\nNot receive credit for additional borrowing capacity under our borrowing base of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, as in the case with the Repeat Precision joint venture;\n\u00b7\nHave different systems or controls, which may subject us to additional risks and vulnerabilities, at the joint venture; and\n\u00b7\nNot carry insurance policies that fully cover loss or damage incurred by both us and our joint venture partners in certain circumstances.\n\ufeff\nThe risks described above or the failure to continue our joint venture could adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture and our ability to receive cash distributions from the joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur operations may be limited or disrupted in certain parts of the continental United States, Canada and Norway during severe weather conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe provide products and services to E&P companies that operate in basins throughout the continental United States, Canada and in Norway. We serve these markets through our facilities and service centers located in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, West Virginia and Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada and Western Norway. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from our operations in geographies where weather conditions may be severe, particularly during winter and spring months. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u00b7\ncurtailment of drilling and completion activity;\n\u00b7\nweather-related damage to equipment resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u00b7\nweather-related damage to our facilities;\n\u00b7\ninability to deliver equipment and materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and\n\u00b7\nloss of productivity.\n\ufeff\nMany municipalities impose bans or other restrictions on the use of roads and highways, which include weight restrictions on the paved roads that lead to our jobsites due to the muddy conditions caused by spring thaws. This can limit our access to these jobsites and our ability to service wells in these areas. Harsh winter conditions in the North Sea can result in strong winds and high waves, which can limit our ability to service offshore platforms. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs in those regions. Weather conditions may also affect the price of crude oil and natural gas, and related demand for our services. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nHydraulic fracturing is substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on the ability of our customers to obtain water may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Over the past several years, certain of the areas in which we sell our products and services have experienced extreme drought conditions and competition for water in such shales is growing. As a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. The inability of our customers to obtain water to use in their operations from local sources or to effectively utilize flowback water could impact demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs, and associated litigation, could result in increased compliance or operating costs, limit the areas in which our customers may conduct exploration and production activities, and reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\n\ufeff\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions is giving rise to an increased likelihood of regulatory actions to address climate change in the United States and abroad. As a result, our customers are or may become subject to statutes or regulations aiming to reduce emissions of GHGs. In December 2009, the EPA determined that\nemissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published final rules under the CAA that establish new and more stringent emission control standards for methane and VOCs released from new and modified oil and natural gas development and production operations. These rules could have an adverse effect on our customers and result in an indirect material adverse effect on our business. However, in September 2020, EPA finalized amendments that relax certain aspects of the methane and VOC emissions limitations, including rescinding the methane and VOC standards for the transmission and storage segment of the oil and natural gas industry, rescinding emissions limits for methane from all segments of the industry and revising standards for VOC emissions in the production and processing segments of the industry. The 2016 rules as well as the September 2020 amendments are the subject of litigation and, as a result, the future implementation of these rules remains uncertain. Regardless of the pending litigation, the EPA under the current administration may reconsider the September 2020 final rule, which could result in more stringent rulemaking.\n\ufeff\nVarious U.S. states or groups of states have adopted or considered adopting legislation, regulations or other governmental actions focused on reducing GHG emissions, including cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking initiatives and renewable portfolio standards. At the international level, the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement in November 2020, the President issued an executive order recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement on January 20, 2021. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how any legal requirements imposed following the implementation of the Paris Agreement or otherwise that may be adopted or issued to address or restrict GHG emissions would impact our business or that of our customers, any such future laws, regulations or legal requirements imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, oil and natural gas exploration activities could require our customers to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with their operations. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce or make it more expensive to develop and produce hydrocarbons, which could have a material adverse effect on future demand for our products and services.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against certain energy companies and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our or our customers\u2019 operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nMoreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our or our customers\u2019 operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.\n\ufeff\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays on our customers which could in turn decrease the demand for our products and services.\n\ufeff\nOur business is dependent on the ability of our customers to conduct hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and other proppants under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. The federal government can, however, limit hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands through permitting. On January 27, 2021, the current administration issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters to the extent possible. This moratorium is subject to litigation, which remains pending. In addition, the current administration cancelled the construction permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would have transported Canadian oil to the Gulf Coast. Federal agencies also have asserted regulatory authority over additional aspects of the process and there are certain governmental reviews either completed, underway, or being proposed that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. These completed, ongoing, or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released a final report assessing the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. In this report, the EPA found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic\nactivity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and natural gas activity and induced seismicity. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly to perform fracturing and increase the costs of compliance and doing business for our customers. In addition, in response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have from time to time, developed and implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. Such actions to restrict or suspend disposal well operations could make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing.\n\ufeff\nVarious state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. For instance, the State of New York elected in 2015 to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether. Any increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce our customers\u2019 demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAt this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.\n\ufeff\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect the ability of our customers to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\n\ufeff\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit the ability of our customers to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Additionally, the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could result in increased costs arising from species protection measures. Restrictions on the oil and natural gas operations of our customers to protect wildlife could reduce demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to meet applicable regulatory requirements for our use of certain chemicals by our tracer diagnostics business, and, even if requirements are met, complying on an ongoing basis with the numerous regulatory requirements will be time-consuming and costly.\n\ufeff\nThe chemicals that we use in our tracer diagnostics business may be subject to government regulation in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the Toxic Substances Control Act (the \u201cTSCA\u201d) which regulates the commercial registration, distribution, and use of many chemicals, including many of the chemicals we use in our tracer diagnostics business. Before we can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, we need to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then we must file a Pre-Manufacture Notice (\u201cPMN\u201d) with the EPA for review. Certain categories of chemical substances may be exempt from a full PMN review, including chemical substances that qualify for a Low Volume Exemption (\u201cLVE\u201d). We have filed PMNs for certain chemicals, and have sought for and obtained LVEs for other chemicals that we use in our tracer diagnostics business, and we will file additional PMNs or seek additional LVEs in the future. We may not be able to expediently receive approval from the EPA to list such chemicals on the TSCA inventory, resulting in delays in our ability to manufacture such chemicals, or significant increases in testing requirements.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, once we have a consent order from the EPA allowing us to manufacture PMN substances for our tracer diagnostics business, we remain subject to regulatory requirements, including, as applicable, volume limitations that may impede us from producing sufficient quantities of such chemicals. Noncompliance with an EPA consent order could result in civil or criminal penalties and delays, or require us to cease operations that are authorized under the consent order. Similar programs exist in most, if not all, of the countries in which we may seek to produce, import or use certain chemicals in our tracer diagnostics business, including compliance with regulations imposed in Canada by the Environment and Climate Change Canada/Health Canada. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain necessary approvals in a timely manner or at all. If we do not meet applicable regulatory requirements in a particular country for some chemicals, then we may not be able to commercialize those chemicals or tracers in such country, and our business could be adversely affected. Changes in regulatory requirements, laws and policies, or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, laws and policies, may result in increased compliance costs, delays, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results.\n\ufeff\nOur operations and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.\n\ufeff\nOur business and our customers\u2019 businesses may be significantly affected by:\n\u00b7\nfederal, state and local and non-U.S. laws and other regulations relating to import tariffs, oilfield operations, worker safety and protection of the environment;\n\u00b7\nchanges in these laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\nthe level of enforcement of these laws and regulations.\n\ufeff\nIf we fail to comply with safety regulations or maintain an acceptable level of safety at our facilities, we may incur fines, penalties or other liabilities, or may be held criminally liable. We may incur additional costs to upgrade equipment or conduct additional training, or otherwise incur costs in connection with compliance with safety regulations. Failure to maintain safe operations or achieve certain safety performance metrics could disqualify us from doing business with certain customers, particularly major oil companies.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on the demand for our products and services from the oil and natural gas industry which is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry in general. For example, the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic or other policy reasons could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products. In addition, some non-U.S. countries may adopt regulations or practices that give advantage to indigenous oil companies in bidding for oil leases, or require indigenous companies to perform oilfield services currently supplied by international service companies. To the extent that such companies are not our customers, or we are unable to develop relationships with them, our business may suffer. We cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations.\n\ufeff\nBecause of our non-U.S. operations and sales, we are subject to changes in regional, political or economic conditions, and non-U.S. laws and policies, including taxes, trade protection measures, and changes in regulatory requirements governing the operations of companies in non-U.S. countries. We are also subject to changes in non-U.S. laws and regulations that may encourage or require hiring of local contractors or require non-U.S. contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. If we fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nChanges in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe United States administration may propose or take action with respect to major changes to trade policies, such as the imposition of additional tariffs on imported products and the withdrawal from or renegotiation of certain trade agreements. In addition, these could also result in additional retaliatory actions by the United States\u2019 trade partners. Given that we procure many of the raw materials that we use to create our products directly or indirectly from outside of the United States, the imposition of tariffs and other potential changes in U.S. trade policy could increase the cost or limit the availability of such raw materials, which could hurt our competitive position and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the United States implemented a tariff of 25% on a significant number of commodities originating from China, including certain chemicals utilized in our tracer diagnostics business. In addition, we sell a significant proportion of our products to customers outside of the United States. Retaliatory actions by other countries could result in increases in the price of our products, which could limit demand for such products, hurt our global competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIf we are unable to accurately predict customer demand or if customers cancel their orders on short notice, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce gross margins. Conversely, insufficient inventory would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially a loss in market share and damaged customer relationships.\n\ufeff\nCustomers can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. As a result, we cannot accurately predict what or how many products such customers will need in the future. Anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management.\n\ufeff\nOrders are placed with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, we may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts of customer demand are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into the estimates. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to the purchase of material or manufactured products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to, if at all. As a result, we would hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce gross margin and adversely affect financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand\nor if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\n\ufeff\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state), Canada and other foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Additionally, several tax authorities have increasingly focused attention on intercompany transfer pricing with respect to sales of products and services and the use of intangibles. Tax authorities could disagree with our cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. If we do not prevail in any such disagreements, our profitability and cash flows may be adversely affected. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.\n\ufeff\nLoss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nWe are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs, including our engineering information and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, whether due to cyberattack or otherwise, possible consequences include our loss of communication links and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\n\ufeff\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. The United States government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption to business operations.\n\ufeff\nOur databases and systems, as well as those of our third-party vendors, have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing and other cyberattacks. We also face risks associated with new personnel, as well as with new processes and technologies which are implemented from time to time to augment our security and privacy management programs. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks, however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party vendors will prevent breaches or breakdowns to databases or systems. If our security measures or those of the third-party vendors we use who have access to this information are inadequate or are breached as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks, system error, trickery or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to sensitive information on our systems or our providers\u2019 systems, our reputation and business could be damaged. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or our third-party vendors\u2019 databases or systems.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Our insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks.\n\ufeff\nComplications with our ERP system could adversely impact our business and operations.\n\ufeff\nWe rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. Our ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business. In the operation of our ERP system we may have technical issues that could cause operating and reporting delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully operate our ERP system, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we do not effectively operate the ERP system, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed.\n\ufeff\nImpairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets and goodwill could negatively affect our operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate our property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. We assess recoverability based on undiscounted future net cash flows, which requires us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts which are uncertain and require various assumptions. If changes in these assumptions occur, our expectations regarding future net cash flows may change such that a material impairment could result. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an impairment charge of $50.2 million related to property and equipment and identified intangible assets. There was no impairment of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $73.5 million related to identifiable intangible assets. There was no impairment related to property and equipment in 2018. See \u201cNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d, \u201cNote 6. Property and Equipment\u201d and \u201cNote 7. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for further information related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nAn assessment of potential goodwill impairment indicators is performed annually or when there is an indication an impairment may have occurred. If a goodwill impairment trigger is indicated, we perform a quantitative test whereby we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets (including allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment. No impairment charge was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an impairment charge of $7.9 million for our tracer diagnostic services reporting unit. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $154.0 million for two reporting units, fracturing systems and well construction of $122.1 million and tracer diagnostic services of $31.9 million. See \u201cNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and \u201cNote 7. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangibles\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for further information related to these charges.\n\ufeff\nWe are unable to predict whether further impairments of one or more of our long-lived assets or investments may occur in the future. A determination that goodwill, a long-lived asset, or other investments are impaired would result in additional non-cash charges that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur business operations in countries outside of the United States are subject to a number of U.S. federal laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and the Commerce Department.\n\ufeff\nLocal laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. In many countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, prohibit corporations and individuals, including us and our employees, from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. We are responsible for any violations by our employees, contractors and agents, whether based within or outside of the United States, for violations of the FCPA. We may also be held responsible for any violations by an acquired company that occur prior to an acquisition, or subsequent to the acquisition but before we are able to institute our compliance procedures. In addition, our non-U.S. competitors that are not subject to the FCPA or similar laws may be able to secure business or other preferential treatment in such countries by means that such laws prohibit with respect to us. A violation of any of these laws, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business.\n\ufeff\nCompliance with U.S. regulations on trade sanctions and embargoes administered by OFAC also poses a risk to us. We cannot provide products or services to certain countries subject to U.S. trade sanctions. Furthermore, the laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.\n\ufeff\nOur success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\n\ufeff\nOur success and future growth is dependent upon the ability of our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel to operate and manage our business and execute on our growth strategies successfully. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, senior managers or other key personnel. We may incur increased expenses in connection with the hiring, promotion, retention or replacement of any of these individuals. These labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the United States, Canada and other foreign jurisdictions, including severance benefits. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable employees, which could adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nOur success and future growth is dependent upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled engineers, geologists and highly trained technicians, and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the oilfield services industry. We may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for these skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for oil and natural gas. Additionally, at times there may be a shortage of skilled and technical personnel available in the market, potentially compounding the difficulty of attracting and retaining these employees. If we are unable to recruit or retain sufficient skilled and technical personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to the risk of supplier concentration.\n\ufeff\nCertain of our product lines depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers and vendors. As a result of this concentration in some of our supply chains, our business and operations could be negatively affected if our key suppliers were to experience significant disruptions affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of their products. The partial or complete loss of any one of our key suppliers, or a significant adverse change in the relationship with any of these suppliers, through consolidation or otherwise, may limit our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements, code requirements or other specifications under contracts and contract tenders.\n\ufeff\nMany of our products could be used in harsh environments and severe service applications. Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids may set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements (including that they meet certain industrial code requirements, such as API, ASME or similar codes, or that our processes and facilities maintain ISO or similar certifications) for our products and services, which may also include extensive testing requirements. We anticipate that such code testing requirements will become more common in our contracts. We cannot assure you that our products or facilities will be able to satisfy the specifications or requirements, or that we will be able to perform the full-scale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts, or that the costs of modifications to our products or facilities to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations. If our products or facilities are unable to satisfy such requirements, or we are unable to perform or satisfy any scale testing, our customers may cancel their contracts and/or seek new suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\n\ufeff\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\n\ufeff\nWe are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason also could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.\n\ufeff\nOur outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total outstanding indebtedness was $5.8 million, of which no amount is currently outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined below). Under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, which is secured by substantially all of our assets, we may borrow up to the lesser of a borrowing base and $25.0 million, with sublimits for loans in foreign currencies and loans to our Canadian subsidiary. The borrowing base, which also limits swingline advances, is determined based on 85% of eligible accounts receivable, which does not include accounts receivable at Repeat Precision, subject to change based on field audit results and the reasonable business judgment of the administrative agent under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facility authorizes, but does not require, the administrative agent to make over-advances, notwithstanding a borrowing base deficiency, up to 10% of the borrowing base (but never to exceed the lenders\u2019 aggregate commitments). Our Senior Secured Credit Facility is subject to Wells Fargo\u2019s customary LIBOR transition provisions (see below). There can be no assurance that our Senior Secured Credit Facility will be adequate in size to satisfy our liquidity needs, or that adverse energy market developments impacting our customers won\u2019t constrain our liquidity by reducing the size of our borrowing base.\nOur outstanding indebtedness, and any additional indebtedness we incur, may have important consequences for us, including, without limitation, that: we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness; our indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressures; our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for general corporate and other purposes may be limited; our indebtedness may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings are at variable rates of interest (including LIBOR); LIBOR-the London interbank offered rate, is expected to begin phasing out by the end of 2021, and to be phased out completely sometime in 2023, and the effect on our debt service burden is unclear; our indebtedness may prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our business; and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited by covenants in our indebtedness documents.\n\ufeff\nUnder the terms of the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants, which may limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. The obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default, which includes customary events of default including, without limitation, payment defaults, cross-defaults to certain material indebtedness, covenant defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, bankruptcy events, material judgments, certain ERISA-related events, material defects with respect to guarantees and collateral, invalidity of subordination provisions and change of control. If not cured, an event of default could result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable, which would require us to, among other things: seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets and/or reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service our indebtedness, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we and our subsidiaries incur substantial additional indebtedness, the related risks to our financial condition could increase.\n\ufeff\nRestrictive covenants in the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\n\ufeff\nThe agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. These include covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; grant liens; enter into burdensome agreements with negative pledge clauses or restrictions on subsidiary distributions; make certain investments; pay dividends; make payments in respect of junior lien or subordinated debt; make acquisitions; consolidate, amalgamate, merge, liquidate or dissolve; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets; make certain organizational changes (including with respect to organizational documents and changes in fiscal year); engage in sale-leaseback transactions; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into operating leases; enter into hedging arrangements; enter into certain leasehold arrangements and arrangements with respect to inventory and equipment; materially alter our business; and incur capital expenditures.\n\ufeff\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility requires, as a condition to borrowing, that (i) if availability under such credit facility is less than 20% of our borrowing base, our fixed charge coverage ratio for the applicable 12 month period must be at least 1.0 to 1.0, and (ii) our available cash on hand does not exceed $10.0 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains (i) a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 for the applicable 12 month period whenever availability under our Senior Secured Credit is less than 20% of our borrowing base, and (ii) a minimum liquidity requirement of at least $7.5 million. Our ability to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio and the minimum liquidity requirement can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy these covenants. Our inability to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio, or the minimum liquidity requirement, could render us unable to borrow under the Senior Credit Facility at the time when liquidity is most needed.\n\ufeff\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility also contains a weekly test requiring a cash sweep and mandatory pay down of the outstanding balance of such facility if from time to time our available cash balance exceeds $12.0 million.\n\ufeff\nA breach of any covenant or restriction contained in the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility could result in an event of default under this agreement. If any such event of default occurs, the lenders under the facility may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, also have the right, upon an event of default thereunder, to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Further, following an event of default under the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, the lenders under the facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt. If the debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility was to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt or any other debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration.\n\ufeff\nVolatility and weakness in bank and capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs for us.\n\ufeff\nThe indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facility matures on May 1, 2023. Our ability to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our assets, borrowing restrictions which may be imposed by lenders and conditions in the credit markets at the time we refinance. Furthermore, bank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, our ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of our debt could be adversely affected. There is also a risk, during periods of volatile credit markets, that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their legal commitments and obligations under existing credit commitments, including our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Although we currently can access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for us. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing. Increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets also could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain financing. In addition, the adoption of new statutes and regulations, the implementation of recently enacted laws or new interpretations or the enforcement of older laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit. Disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect our lenders, insurers, customers and other counterparties. Perceptions of us and the industries in which we or our customers operate, including perceptions of our environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) attributes may result in pressure on banks and other financial institutions to reduce or avoid lending, which could further reduce the available pool of financing for us and increase the cost of financing to us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\ufeff\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\ufeff\nSecurities markets worldwide have experienced in the past, and are likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations. Specifically, the oilfield services sector has recently experienced significant market volatility. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our results of operations. The trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including, among other things, the risk factors described herein and other factors beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include:\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in the oil and natural gas industry in general or in the oil and natural gas services market in particular;\n\u00b7\nvariations in operating results of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new services by us, our competitors or our customers;\n\u00b7\nissuance of new, negative or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports, recommendations or estimates;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perceptions of us and the industries in which we or our customers operate, including perceptions of our ESG attributes;\n\u00b7\nsales, or anticipated sales, of our stock, including sales by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nregulatory or political developments;\n\u00b7\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nannouncements, media reports or other public forum comments related to litigation, claims or reputational charges against us;\n\u00b7\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u00b7\nthe sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those resulting from system failures and disruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes, war, acts of terrorism, other natural disasters or responses to these events;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u00b7\nshare-based compensation expense under applicable accounting standards;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u00b7\nchanging economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock sometimes have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Securities litigation against us, regardless of the merits or outcome, could result in substantial costs and divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our business, profitability and reputation.\n\ufeff\nWe are controlled by the Advent Funds, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\n\ufeff\nWe are controlled by funds (the \u201cAdvent Funds\u201d) managed by Advent, which beneficially own in the aggregate 62.6% of the combined voting power of our common stock. As a result of this ownership, Advent will have effective control over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our charter and bylaws and other significant corporate transactions.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, persons associated with Advent currently serve on our board of directors (our \u201cBoard\u201d). The interests of Advent may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders, and the concentration of effective control in Advent will limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power of Advent also may delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third-party or other change of control and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support, even if such events are in the best interests of our other stockholders.\n\ufeff\nFurther, Advent may have an interest in having us pursue acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt or equity and the declaration and payment of dividends, that, in its judgment, could enhance Advent\u2019s equity investments, even though such transactions may involve risk to us or to our creditors. Additionally, the Advent Funds may make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us, or may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\n\ufeff\nAdvent may take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the value of your investment to decline.\n\ufeff\nAdvent and our directors affiliated with Advent, with certain exceptions, do not have obligations to present business opportunities to us and may compete with us.\n\ufeff\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended by the Certificate of Amendment, our \u201camended and restated certificate of incorporation\u201d) provides that Advent and our directors affiliated with Advent do not have any obligation to offer us an opportunity to participate in business opportunities presented to them even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued (and therefore may be free to compete with us in the same business or similar businesses), and that, to the extent permitted by law, Advent and such directors, will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any duty by reason of any such activities.\n\ufeff\nAs a result, Advent or any of its managers, officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than us and our subsidiaries) will not be prohibited from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our clients. Therefore, we may be in competition with Advent and such persons or their respective affiliates, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose certain corporate opportunities or suffer competitive harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\n\ufeff\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\n\ufeff\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings. As of March 4, 2021, we had 2,360,007 outstanding shares of our common stock. We also have registered 707,251 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans and 100,000 registered shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for U.S. Employees (the \u201cU.S. ESPP\u201d) and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for non-U.S. Employees (the \u201cNon-U.S. ESPP\u201d and together with the U.S. ESPP, the \u201cESPP\u201d). Of those shares initially registered and reserved for issuance, 13,584 shares of common stock were issued in 2019 in connection with the settlement of our prior ESPP offering periods. The ESPP was temporarily suspended for future offering periods beginning on July 1, 2019. See Part III, Item 12. \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d for more information.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, we currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC to allow us to sell and certain requesting holders to resell shares of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that such market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n\ufeff\nWe have elected to take advantage of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption to the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\n\ufeff\nBecause we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies on NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), we are not required to have a majority of our Board be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or a Board committee performing the Board nominating function. As permitted by our status as a controlled company, we may choose to change our Board composition, or the composition of the compensation, nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, should the interests of the Advent Funds differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\n\ufeff\nAnti-takeover protections in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws or our contractual obligations may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\n\ufeff\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our common stock, even if it would benefit our stockholders.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, our Board has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock or\nthe adoption of a stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, under the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, a change of control would cause an event of default to occur and the lenders under the facility would have the right to accelerate their loans, and if so accelerated, we would be required to repay all of our outstanding obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. In addition, from time to time we may enter into contracts that contain change of control provisions that limit the value of, or even terminate, the contract upon a change of control. These change of control provisions may discourage a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\n\ufeff\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and may elect to comply with reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\n\ufeff\nWe are an emerging growth company and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we choose to comply with certain of the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\n\ufeff\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2022, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period, whether or not issued in a registered offering.\n\ufeff\nNotwithstanding the above, we are also currently a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $250 million. In the event that we are still considered a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d at such time we cease being an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we will be required to provide additional disclosure in our SEC filings. However, similar to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d, \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley; have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements and are exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.\n\ufeff\nDecreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\n\ufeff\nWe may identify material weaknesses or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause to us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or fail to prevent fraud; which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we might not be able to report on our financial results accurately or prevent fraud; which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our common stock. Any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, an independent registered public accounting firm has never performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because no such evaluation has been required. Had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, material weaknesses may have been identified. If we are unable to prevent or remediate any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional material weaknesses that may exist, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing\nrequirements, we may be unable to prevent fraud, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result. Additionally, our reporting obligations as a public company could place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future and may cause us to fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting.\n\ufeff\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to certain exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\n\ufeff\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate or our amended and restated by-laws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision that will be contained in our certificate to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nApplication of the choice of forum provision may be limited in some instances by law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act provides for exclusive federal court jurisdiction over Exchange Act claims. Accordingly, to the extent the exclusive forum provision is held to cover a stockholder derivative action asserting claims under the Exchange Act, such claims could not be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and would instead be within the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the District of Delaware. Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Moreover, our stockholders will not be deemed by operation of our choice of forum provision to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 16675, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "NCSM"}
