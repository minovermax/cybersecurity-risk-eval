RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry or financial position or our future financial performance. While the Company believes it has identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting its business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect its business, operations, industry, financial position and financial performance in the future.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s ability to secure and maintain sufficient credit arrangements is key to its continued operations.\n\ufeff\nPrior to March 31, 2017 the Company had a senior secured credit facility with Wells Fargo, N.A. with a credit limit up to $30,000,000. The credit facility was collateralized by substantially all of the Company\u2019s domestically located assets and the Company had pledged 65% of its equity ownership interest in some of its foreign entities. Prior to its payoff and termination, the Wells Fargo, N.A. senior secured credit facility was due to expire on October 31, 2018. On March 31, 2017, the Company paid the balance outstanding under the senior credit facility in the amount of $22,232,914. The remaining deferred financing costs of $68,475 were expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOn March 31, 2017, the Company entered into a $35,000,000 senior secured credit facility with U.S. Bank, N.A., which expires on March 31, 2022. The credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company\u2019s domestically located assets. The facility allows the Company to choose among interest rates at which it may borrow funds: the bank fixed rate of four percent or LIBOR plus one and one half percent (effectively 2.65% at April 30, 2017). Interest is due monthly. Under the senior secured credit facility, the Company may borrow up to the lesser of (i) $35,000,000 or (ii) an amount equal to a percentage of the eligible receivable borrowing base plus a percentage of the inventory borrowing base. Deferred financing costs of $207,647 were capitalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and will be amortized over the term of the agreement. As of April 30, 2017, there was $23,178,429 outstanding and $11,821,571 of unused availability under the U.S. Bank, N.A. facility compared to an outstanding balance of $20,014,069 and $3,630,035 of unused availability under the Wells Fargo, N.A. senior credit facility at April 30, 2016. At April 30, 2017, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenant and other restricted covenants under the credit facility.\n\ufeff\nOn August 4, 2015, the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd entered into a credit facility with China Construction Bank. Under the agreement Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd can borrow up to 5,000,000 Renminbi and the facility is collateralized by Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd.\u2019s manufacturing building. Interest is payable monthly and the facility bears a fixed interest rate of 6.67%. The facility was due to expire on August 3, 2017. The credit facility was closed as of March 1, 2017. There was no outstanding balance under the facility at April 30, 2017 or April 30, 2016.\n\ufeff\nOn March 24, 2017, the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd entered into a credit facility with China Construction Bank. Under the agreement SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd can borrow up to 9,000,000 Renminbi and the facility is collateralized by Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd.\u2019s manufacturing building. Interest is payable monthly and the facility bears a fixed interest rate of 6.09%. The term of the facility extends to February 7, 2018. There was no outstanding balance under the facility at April 30, 2017.\n\ufeff\nThe Company anticipates that its credit facilities, cash flow from operations and leasing resources are adequate to meet its working capital requirements and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018. In addition, in the event the Company desires to expand its operations, its business grows more rapidly than expected, the current economic climate deteriorates, customers delay payments, or the Company desires to consummate an acquisition, additional financing resources may be necessary in the current or future fiscal years. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain equity or debt financing at acceptable terms, or at all, in the future. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to retain or renew its credit agreements in the future, or that any retention or renewal will be on the same terms as currently exist.\n\ufeff\nAdverse changes in the economy or political conditions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s sales and gross margins depend significantly on market demand for its customers\u2019 products. The uncertainty in the U.S. and international economic and political environments could result in a decline in demand for our customers\u2019 products in any industry. Further, any adverse changes in tax rates and laws affecting our customers could result in decreasing gross margins. Any of these factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company experiences variable operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations have varied and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period, including on a quarterly basis. Consequently, results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period, and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Some of these factors include:\n\ufeff\n- changes in sales mix to customers\n- changes in availability and rising component costs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n- volume of customer orders relative to capacity\n- market demand and acceptance of our customers\u2019 products\n- price erosion within the EMS marketplace\n- capital equipment requirements needed to remain technologically competitive\n- volatility in the U.S. and international economic and financial markets\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s customer base is concentrated.\n\ufeff\nSales to the Company\u2019s five largest customers accounted for 55.2% and 61.9% of net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended April 30, 2017, two customers accounted for 26.7% and 12.6%, respectively, of net sales of the Company, and 8.4% and 4.2%, respectively, of accounts receivable at April 30, 2017. For the year ended April 30, 2016, two customers accounted for 35.2% and 10.6%, respectively, of net sales of the Company and 6.5% and 2.4%, respectively, of accounts receivable at April 30, 2016. Significant reductions in sales to any of the Company\u2019s major customers or the loss of a major customer could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations. If the Company cannot replace canceled or reduced orders, sales will decline, which could have a material impact on the results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will retain any or all of its largest customers. This risk may be further complicated by pricing pressures and intense competition prevalent in our industry.\n\ufeff\nIf any of the Company\u2019s customers have financial difficulties, the Company could encounter delays or defaults in the payment of amounts owed for accounts receivable and inventory obligations. This could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nMost of the Company\u2019s customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities and manage inventory levels.\n\ufeff\nThe volume and timing of sales to the Company\u2019s customers may vary due to:\n- customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory\n- variation in demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products\n- design changes, or\n- acquisitions of or consolidation among customers\n\ufeff\nMany of the Company\u2019s customers do not commit to firm production schedules. The Company\u2019s inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty can make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity and manage inventory levels. The Company could be required to increase or decrease staffing and more closely manage other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of its customers. Orders from the Company\u2019s customers could be cancelled or delivery schedules could be deferred as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 demand, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations in any given quarter.\n\ufeff\nThe Company and its customers may be unable to keep current with the industry\u2019s technological changes.\n\ufeff\nThe market for the Company\u2019s manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing product development. The future success of the Company\u2019s business will depend in large part upon our customers\u2019 ability to maintain and enhance their technological capabilities, develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis.\n\ufeff\nOur customers have competitive challenges, including rapid technological changes, pricing pressure and decreasing demand from their customers, which could adversely affect their business and the Company\u2019s.\n\ufeff\nFactors affecting the industries that utilize our customers\u2019 products could negatively impact our customers and the Company. These factors include:\n\ufeff\n- increased competition among our customers and their competitors\n- the inability of our customers to develop and market their products\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n- recessionary periods in our customers\u2019 markets\n- the potential that our customers\u2019 products become obsolete\n- our customers\u2019 inability to react to rapidly changing technology\n\ufeff\nAny such factor or a combination of factors could negatively impact our customers\u2019 need for or ability to pay for our products, which could, in turn, affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAdverse market conditions could reduce our future sales and earnings per share.\n\ufeff\nUncertainty over the erosion of global consumer confidence amidst concerns about volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, declining asset values, inflation, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, and sovereign nations has slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in many countries, including in the United States, Europe and certain countries in Asia over the past several years. The economic recovery of recent years is fragile and recessionary conditions may return. Any of these potential negative economic conditions may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products and adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales. Consequently, the Company\u2019s past operating results, earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of the Company\u2019s future operating results, earnings and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nCustomer relationships with start-up companies present more risk.\n\ufeff\nA small portion of the Company\u2019s current customer base is comprised of start-up companies. Customer relationships with start-up companies may present heightened risk due to the lack of product history. Slow market acceptance of their products could result in demand fluctuations causing inventory levels to rise. Further, the current economic environment could make it difficult for such emerging companies to obtain additional funding. This may result in additional credit risk including, but not limited to, the collection of trade account receivables and payment for their inventory. If the Company does not have adequate allowances recorded, the results of operations may be negatively affected.\n\ufeff\nThe Company faces intense industry competition and downward pricing pressures.\n\ufeff\nThe EMS industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater experience, as well as greater manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and financial resources than the Company.\n\ufeff\nCompetition from existing or potential new competitors may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The introduction of lower priced competitive products, significant price reductions by the Company\u2019s competitors or significant pricing pressures from its customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company has foreign operations that may pose additional risks.\n\ufeff\nThe Company has substantial manufacturing operations in multiple countries. Therefore, the Company\u2019s foreign businesses and results of operations are dependent upon numerous related factors, including the stability of the foreign economies, the political climate, relations with the United States, prevailing worker wages, the legal authority of the Company to operate and expand its business in a foreign country, and the ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified personnel and operating management in Mexico, China and Vietnam.\n\ufeff\nThe Company obtains many of its materials and components through its IPO in Taipei, Taiwan. The Company\u2019s access to these materials and components is dependent on the continued viability of its Asian suppliers.\n\ufeff\nApproximately 14.0% and 15.0% of the total non-current consolidated assets of the Company are located in foreign jurisdictions outside the United States as of April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nDisclosure and internal controls may not detect all errors or fraud.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and internal controls may not prevent all errors and all fraud. The Company\u2019s disclosure controls and internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance that the procedures will meet the control objectives. Controls are limited in their effectiveness by human error, including faulty judgments in decision-making. Further, controls can be circumvented by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls.\n\ufeff\nInadequate internal control over financial reporting could result in a reduction in the value of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nIf the Company identifies and reports a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, shareholders and the Company\u2019s lenders could lose confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial statements. This could have a material adverse impact on the value of the Company\u2019s stock and the Company\u2019s liquidity.\n\ufeff\nThere is a risk of fluctuation of various currencies integral to the Company\u2019s operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company purchases some of its material components and funds some of its operations in foreign currencies. From time to time the currencies fluctuate against the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and performance. The impact of currency fluctuations for the year ended April 30, 2017 resulted in foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $508,000 compared to a net foreign currency loss of $59,000 in the prior year. These fluctuations are expected to continue and could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company did not, and is not expected to, utilize derivatives or hedge foreign currencies to reduce the risk of such fluctuations.\n\ufeff\nThe availability of raw components or an increase in their price may affect the Company\u2019s operations and profits.\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company\u2019s production process. Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, a customer\u2019s specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers. The Company does not enter into long-term purchase agreements with major or single-source suppliers. The Company believes that short-term purchase orders with its suppliers provides flexibility, given that the Company\u2019s orders are based on the changing needs of its customers.\n\ufeff\nThe Company depends on management and skilled personnel.\n\ufeff\nThe Company depends significantly on its President/CEO and other executive officers. The Company\u2019s employees generally are not bound by employment agreements and the Company cannot assure that it will retain its executive officers or skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of these key employees could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, despite significant competition, continued growth and expansion of the Company\u2019s EMS business will require that the Company attract, motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel. The inability to satisfy such requirements could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to remain competitive in the future.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFavorable labor relations are important to the Company.\n\ufeff\nThe Company currently has labor union contracts with its employees constituting approximately 50% and 45% of its workforce for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although the Company believes its labor relations are good, any labor disruptions, whether union-related or otherwise, could significantly impair the Company\u2019s business, substantially increase the Company\u2019s costs or otherwise have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFailure to comply with environmental regulations could subject the Company to liability.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process. To date, the cost to the Company of such compliance has not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, the Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by the Company and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure by the Company to comply with present or future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production which could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nConflict minerals regulations may cause the Company to incur additional expenses and could increase the cost of components contained in its products and adversely affect its inventory supply chain.\n\ufeff\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) thereunder, requires the Company to determine and report annually whether any conflict minerals contained in our products originated from the DRC or an adjoining country. The Dodd-Frank Act and these rules could affect our ability to source components that contain conflict minerals at acceptable prices and could impact the availability of conflict minerals, since there may be only a limited number of suppliers of conflict-free conflict minerals. Our customers may require that our products contain only conflict-free conflict minerals, and our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet this requirement at a reasonable price or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting this requirement. Additionally, the Company may suffer reputational harm with our customers and other stakeholders if our products are not conflict-free. The Company could incur significant costs in the event we are unable to manufacture products that contain only conflict-free conflict minerals or to the extent that we are required to make changes to products, processes, or sources of supply due to the foregoing requirements or pressures.\n\ufeff\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is volatile.\n\ufeff\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock historically has experienced significant volatility due to fluctuations in the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings, other factors relating to the Company\u2019s operations, the market\u2019s changing expectations for the Company\u2019s growth, overall equity market conditions and other factors unrelated to the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, the limited float of the Company\u2019s common stock and the limited number of market makers also affect the volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock. Such fluctuations are expected to continue in the future.\n\ufeff\nAn adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company pays interest on outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facility and certain other long-term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate. An adverse change in the Company\u2019s interest rates could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nChanges in securities laws and regulations may increase costs.\n\ufeff\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and listing requirements subsequently adopted by Nasdaq in response to Sarbanes-Oxley, have required changes in corporate governance practices, internal control policies and securities disclosure and compliance practices of public companies. More recently the Dodd-Frank Act requires changes to our corporate governance, compliance practices and securities disclosures. Compliance following the implementation of these rules has increased our legal, financial and accounting costs. The Company expects increased costs related to these new regulations to continue, including, but not limited to, legal, financial and accounting costs. These developments may result in the Company having difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified members of the board or qualified officers. Further, the costs associated with the compliance with and implementation of procedures under these laws and related rules could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nAny litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\n\ufeff\nIn the past, the Company has been notified of claims relating to various matters including intellectual property rights, contractual matters, labor issues or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the event of any such claim, the Company may be required to spend a significant amount of money and resources, even where the claim is without merit. Accordingly, the resolution of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, consolidated financial conditions and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIf the security of the Company\u2019s systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, the Company\u2019s reputation may be severely harmed and it may be exposed to liability.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s system stores confidential information which includes its financial information, its customers\u2019 proprietary email distribution lists, product information, supplier information, and other critical data. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could expose the Company to liability for the loss of such information, adverse regulatory action by federal and state governments, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity, which could severely damage the Company\u2019s reputation. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in its software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of its customers\u2019 data, its relationships with its customers may be severely damaged, and the Company could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company and its third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify customers of data security breaches involving their data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause the Company\u2019s customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of its data security measures. Any security breach whether actual or perceived, could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, could cause it to lose customers and may negatively impact its ability to acquire new customers.\n\ufeff\nWith the increased use of technologies such as the Internet to conduct business, a company is susceptible to operational, information security and related risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyberattacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (e.g., through \u201chacking\u201d or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption (e.g., ransomware attacks). Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber incidents affecting the Company or its service providers have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, interference with the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business in the ordinary course, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, additional compliance costs and, in extreme cases, have caused companies to cease doing business. Cyber events also can affect counterparties or clients with which the Company does business, governmental and other regulatory authorities, banks, insurance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncompanies and other financial institutions, among others. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. While the Company has established risk management systems to prevent such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such systems including the possibility that the Company has not prepared for certain risks that have not been or are not possible to have been identified. Further, the Company may be able to influence, but cannot control, the cyber security plans and systems put in place by its service providers or any other third parties whose operations may affect the Company. The Company could be negatively impacted as a result.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 80274, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "SGMA"}
