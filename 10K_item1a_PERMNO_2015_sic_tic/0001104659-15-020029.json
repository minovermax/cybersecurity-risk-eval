RISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nOverall Business Risks\nThe Company\u2019s Business May Be Adversely Affected by Conditions in the Financial Markets and Economic Conditions Generally and Locally. National and international markets continue to recover from the aftermath of the severe recession. Numerous fiscal and monetary policy measures address the evolving conditions related to the uneven conditions of economic and financial recovery. A slowing or failure of economic recovery in the U.S. and in the Company\u2019s markets could adversely effect these challenging economic and market conditions, with potential risks and negative impacts on the us and others in the financial services industry. A deterioration of business and economic conditions, particularly in our local markets, could adversely affect the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans, results of operations and financial condition.\nLending\nDeterioration in the Housing Sector, Commercial Real Estate, and Related Markets May Adversely Affect Business and Financial Results.\nReal estate lending is a major business activity for the Company. Real estate market conditions affect the value and marketability of this real estate collateral, and they also affect the cash flows, liquidity, and net worth of many borrowers whose operations and finances depend on real estate market conditions. Adverse conditions in our market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Emphasis on Commercial Lending May Expose the Company to Increased Lending Risks, Which Could Hurt Profits.\nBerkshire plans to continue to emphasize the origination of commercial loans, which generally exposes us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Commercial loans are historically more sensitive to economic downturns. Such sensitivity includes potentially higher default rates and possible reduction of collateral values. Commercial lending involves larger loan sizes and larger relationship exposures, which can have a greater impact on profits in the event of adverse loan performance. The majority of the Company\u2019s commercial loans is secured by real estate and subject to the previously discussed real estate risk factors. Commercial lending sometimes involves construction or other development financing, which is dependent on the future success of new operations. The Company\u2019s commercial lending activities have extended across wider parts of its New England and New York markets into areas where the Company has less business experience. The Company\u2019s commercial lending includes asset based lending, which depends on the Company\u2019s processes for monitoring and being able to liquidate collateral on which these loans rely. The Company includes small business lending in its commercial loan disclosures. The Company has expanded this lending function and re-engineered it small business loan origination process in order to accelerate growth. Additionally, the Company has expanded its wholesale purchases and sales of loans and loan participations with other banks doing business in its markets, including participations in national credits. Commercial loans may increase as a percentage of total loans, and commercial lending may continue to expose the company to increased risks.\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses May Prove to be Insufficient to Absorb Losses in The Loan Portfolio.\nLike all financial institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses which is our estimate of the probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio as of the financial statement date. However, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. The accounting measurements related to impairment and the loan loss allowance require significant estimates which are subject to uncertainty and changes relating to new information and changing circumstances. Additionally, the allowance can only reflect those losses which are reasonably estimable, and there are constraints in our ability to estimate losses in this period of unusual economic and financial stress. This is particularly relevant for our estimates of losses for pools of loans. Accordingly, at any time, there may be probable losses inherent in the portfolio but which we are not reasonably able to estimate until additional information emerges which can form the basis for a reasonable estimate.\nState and federal regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by these regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates Related to Accounting for Acquired Loans May Differ From Actual Results.\nUnder generally accepted principles for business combinations, there is no loan loss allowance recorded for acquired loans, which are recorded at net fair value on the acquisition date. This net fair value generally includes embedded loss estimates for acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality. These estimates are based on projections of expected cash flows for these problem loans, which in many cases rely on estimates deriving from the liquidation of collateral. If the projections are inadequate, the fair value estimates may exceed the actual collectability of the balances, and this may result in the related loans being considered impaired, which would result in a reduction in interest income. If fair value estimates differ from actual collectability, then tangible book value of the Company will have been recorded incorrectly at the time of the acquisition, and subsequent earnings will differ from original estimates. Measures of tangible book value and earnings impacts of business combinations are frequently used in evaluating the merits and value of business combinations. The Company has recorded significant income resulting from collections of acquired impaired loans which exceeded the fair value estimates originally established. Additionally, accounting for acquired loans involves ongoing assessments of the timing and amount of expected loan collections. Numerous assumptions and estimates are integral to purchased loan accounting, and actual results could be different from prior estimates.\nNew regulations could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to originate and sell mortgage loans.\nThe CFPB has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the CFPB\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u00b7 excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u00b7 interest-only payments;\n\u00b7 negative-amortization; and\n\u00b7 terms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages\ncould limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive/and or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nOperating\nExpansion, Growth, and Acquisitions Could Negatively Impact Earnings If Not Successful.\nThe Company plans to achieve significant growth organically, by geographic expansion, through business line expansion, and through acquisitions. We have recently expanded into new geographic markets and anticipate that we will continue to expand into additional geographic markets as we grow as a regional bank. The success of this expansion depends on our ability to continue to maintain and develop an infrastructure appropriate to support and integrate such growth. Also, our success depends on the acceptance by customers of us and our services in these new markets and, in the case of expansion through acquisitions, our success depends on many factors, including the long-term recruitment and retention of key personnel and acquired customer relationships. The profitability of our expansion strategy also depends on whether the income we generate in the new markets will offset the increased expenses of operating a larger entity with increased personnel, more branch locations and additional product offerings. In 2013, revenues decreased in the second half of the year due to changes related to loans and operations acquired in the prior two years. The Company has implemented certain expense restructuring activities, related in part to the rationalization of acquired operations. Such activities expose us to risk that revenues may be affected or that changes in operations may result in inefficiencies or control deficiencies that could contribute to financial or market share losses.\nBerkshire continues to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand through acquisition of banks, insurance agencies, and wealth management firms. Some of these opportunities could result in further geographic expansion. Merger and acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks, including lending, operating, and integration risks. Growth through acquisition requires careful due diligence, evaluation of risks, and projections of future operations and financial conditions. Actual results may differ from our expectations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Growth through acquisition also often involves the negotiation and execution of extensive merger agreements. Such agreements may give rise to litigation, constrain us in certain ways, or expose us to other risks beyond our normal operating risks.\nThe Company completed the purchase and integration of 20 branches in Central New York in 2014. The amount of deposits acquired was significantly below the amount at the time of the purchase agreement. Runoff abated after the purchase was completed, but it there is future attrition of deposit balances or difficulties in retaining acquired customer relationships, the expected benefits of this acquisition may not be realized.The Company\u2019s recruitment of new executive and commercial lending management has in several cases brought in new management who previously worked at larger institutions. These individuals have often served larger customers than the Company has historically serviced, and they have had the benefit of larger capital and administrative resources than are present in the Company\u2019s current structure. The success of this recruitment may depend on the successful integration of these individuals into the Company and may expose the Company to lending and operating losses related to large new customers in newer markets. The Company\u2019s commercial banking strategy has particularly focused on taking market share from larger national institutions and in many cases these new accounts are larger than the Company\u2019s historic accounts. Additionally, the Company\u2019s ability to service these accounts may in some cases involve arranging loan participations and syndications. These activities can expose the Company to additional lending, administrative, and liquidity risks. The Company also actively recruits in other business lines, including private banking and wealth management. This activity can give the Company additional access to large customers in its markets in order to expand our business. Such recruitment can affect the retention of new and old business, and can also be affected by competitive reactions and other relationship risks in retaining accounts.\nOperations acquired in business combinations have frequently been subject to bank regulations prior to the merger date. Related regulatory examinations may result in the identification of certain operating matters requiring remediation, undisclosed deficiencies related to regulatory compliance, deficiencies that arise as a result of integration of acquired operations and operating activities conducted by those operations subsequent to the merger date, or impacts on existing business operations which are being integrated with the acquired operations. Any identified deficiencies related to regulatory compliance may result in changes that affect operating revenues and costs, including the scope or scale of business activities and/or potential future expansion initiatives.\nCompetition From Financial Institutions and Other Financial Service Providers May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Growth and Profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Larger banking institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer certain services that we do not. Local competitors with excess capital may accept lower returns on new business. There is increased competition by out-of-market competitors through the internet. Federal regulations and financial support programs may in some cases favor competitors or place us at an economic disadvantage. Our profitability depends on our continued ability to successfully compete and grow profitably in our market areas. Competition among financial institutions has included competition for banking teams and talent which creates risk that revenues, earnings, or market share could be adversely affected by the loss of talent.\nMarket Changes May Adversely Affect Demand For The Company\u2019s Services and Impact Revenue, Costs, and Earnings.\nChannels for servicing the Company\u2019s customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, more use of online and mobile banking, and demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiples product lines. The Company has an ongoing process for evaluating the profitability of its branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships. The Company competes with larger providers who are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process.\nThe Company is Subject to Security and Operational Risks Relating to Our Use of Technology that Could Damage Our Reputation and Our Business.\nSecurity breaches of confidential information in our internet banking activities could expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our data security could also deter customers from using our internet banking services. We rely on industry standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our security systems from compromises or breaches and could result in damage to our reputation and our business. We utilize third party core banking software and for some systems we have outsourced our data processing to a third party. If our third party providers encounter difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating and/or transmitting with such third parties, it could significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which could significantly affect our business operations. We utilize file encryption in designated internal systems and networks and are subject to certain state and federal regulations regarding how we manage data security. Our enterprise governance risk and compliance function includes a framework of controls, policies and technologies to monitor and protect information from cyberattacks, mishandling, and loss, together with safeguards related to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Natural disasters and disaster recovery risks could affect our operating systems, which could affect our reputation. Our business continuity program addresses crisis management, business impact, and data and systems recovery. Potential problems with the management of technology security and operational risks may affect regulatory compliance, which could affect operating costs and expansion plans.\nThe Company faces cybersecurity risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. As a growing regional bank, the Company anticipates that it may be\nsubject to similar attacks in the future. Hacking and identity theft risks could cause serious reputational harm to the Company. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. The Company may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and the Company may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences to the Company, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company or those of its customers and counterparties. A security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nFinancial and Operating Counterparties Expose the Company to Risks.\nWe have increased our use of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, which exposes us to financial and contractual risks with counterparty banks. We maintain correspondent bank relationships, manage certain loan participations, engage in securities transactions, and engage in other activities with financial counterparties that are customary to our industry. We also utilize services from major vendors of technology, telecommunications, and other essential operating services. There is financial and operating risk in these relationships, which we seek to manage through internal controls and procedures, but there are no assurances that we will not experience loss or interruption of our business as a result of unforeseen events with these providers. Our expanded mortgage lending and mortgage banking operations have also exposed us to more counterparty transactions including the use of third parties to participate in the management of interest rate risk and mortgage sales and hedging. Financial and operational risks are inherent in these counterparty relationships.\nThe Company May Not Be Able to Attract and Retain Skilled People.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees, and continue to compensate employees competitively. Competition for the best people in our industry can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain appropriately qualified individuals. As a result of recent revenue declines and expense restructuring activities, the Company could experience changes in the retention of existing employees.\nControls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRetail Lending Changes Expose the Company to Operating Risks.\nVolatile conditions in mortgage markets have been reflected in changes in the Company\u2019s mortgage operations. The Company has expanded its recruitment and re-engineered its mortgage banking activities (including a systems conversion) and changed its management of this function. Similarly, consumer indirect auto lending has varied between high growth and declines in a short amount of time.\nThese changes expose us to operating risks and expose the Bank to the risk of loan losses, losses related to interest rate risk management, compliance, litigation, and other risks common in consumer lending operations.\nDerivatives and Counterparty Risks Have Increased.\nBerkshire could experience losses if there are failures in the controls or accounting for these activities or if there are performance failures by any of these new counterparties. The risk of loss is increased when interest rates change suddenly and if the intended hedging objectives are not achieved as a result of market or counterparty behaviors. The sudden change in interest rates in 2013 contributed to lower mortgage banking profitability in 2013.\nFollowing the completion of the New York branch acquisition shortly after year-end 2013, all outstanding interest rate swaps related to Federal Home Loan Bank loans were terminated and new borrowings and interest rate swaps were entered into based on an analysis of the current interest rate profile and objectives. These terminations in hedge management were due to changed circumstances and the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its hedge accounting methods depends on its ability to forecast related economic and financial factors which could limit its ability to utilize these methods in the event of future unforeseen events.\nOngoing System Conversions Expose the Company to Operating and Financial Risks.\nFollowing its core systems conversion in 2012, the Company has further converted companion accounting and banking systems. These conversions also create increasing risks of maintaining systems interfaces. The changes expose the Bank to new risks with new systems and new vendors. The Bank has worked closely with third parties to manage the related operating and financial risks. Potential problems with new systems could involve regulatory compliance risk, potentially resulting in higher operating costs or limitations on operating activities. The new systems involve new costs with the new vendor, which could exceed expectations and impact profitability and future vendor relations.\nLiquidity\nOur Wholesale Funding Sources May Prove Insufficient to Replace Deposits at Maturity and Support Our Operations and Future Growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to adjusted deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. These sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, and liquidity resources at the holding company. Most recently, the Company has expanded its use of brokered deposits both to support ongoing growth and to provide enhanced deposit insurance to support large dollar commercial relationships. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us. The Company\u2019s long term plan anticipates asset growth at a faster rate than deposit growth, which has resulted in increased reliance on wholesale or nontraditional funding sources. If deposits in new markets do not remain at planned levels, this could increase the possible reliance on wholesale or nontraditional funding sources.\nThe Company Has Terminated Its Participation in the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund Size Thresholds, Which May Result In Changes to the Company and the Bank\u2019s Operations.\nDue to ongoing growth, the Company exceeded certain Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund size thresholds. Berkshire Bank chose to withdraw from participation in the Depositors Insurance Fund. The Bank was required, under Massachusetts law, to convert from a Massachusetts savings bank to a Massachusetts trust company and, under federal law, the Company was required to convert from a savings and loan holding company to a bank holding company. Such a charter conversion and holding company change affected the overall powers and obligations of the Company and the Bank. None of these issues affected the Bank\u2019s federal deposit insurance coverage by the FDIC the withdrawal from the DIF supplemental insurance program included a notice and transition time period for currently insured accounts\nwhich is extending into 2015. Withdrawal from DIF could have negative impact to future deposit acquisition or retention. The Company believes that related charter changes were accomplished in an orderly manner without significant impact to business operations.\nOur Ability to Service Our Debt, Pay Dividends and Otherwise Pay Our Obligations as They Come Due Is Substantially Dependent on Capital Distributions from the Bank, and These Distributions Are Subject to Regulatory Limits and Other Restrictions.\nA substantial source of our holding company income is the receipt of dividends from the Bank, from which we service our debt, pay our obligations, and pay shareholder dividends. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the applicable regulatory authorities could assert that payment of dividends or other types of payments are an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nInterest Rates\nChanges in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nNet interest income is our largest source of income. Changes in interest rates can affect the level of net interest income. The Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity is discussed in more detail in Item 7A of this report. The Company principally manages interest rate risk by managing its volume and mix of earning assets and funding liabilities. In a changing interest rate environment, the Company may not be able to manage this risk effectively. If the Company is unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. Changes in interest rates can also affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and the supply conditions in the U.S. financial and capital markets. Changes in the level of interest rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate real estate loans, the value of its assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings.\nSecurities Market Values\nDeclines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require Write-Downs, Which Would Reduce Our Earnings.\nUnrealized losses on investment securities result from changes in credit spreads and liquidity issues in the marketplace, along with changes in the credit profile of individual securities issuers. The Company concluded that, as of year-end 2014, any unrealized losses are temporary in nature, and it has the intent and ability to hold these investments for a time necessary to recover its cost or stated maturity (at which time, full payment is expected). However, a continued decline in the value of these securities or other factors could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down which would reduce earnings. The Company has increased its investment in equity securities and non-investment grade debt securities which may exhibit more credit risk and price volatility. Some of the Company\u2019s securities are locally originated economic development bonds. These securities could become impaired due to economic and real estate market conditions which also affect loan risk. The Company has an investment in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which currently provides a modest dividend after a period when the dividend was suspended. If the capitalization of a Federal Home Loan Bank, including the FHLBB, became substantially diminished it could result in a write-down which would reduce our earnings. Future regulatory pronouncements could affect the securities portfolio and its carrying value.\nRegulatory\nLegislative and Regulatory Initiatives May Affect Business Activities and Increase Operating Costs.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending, funding practices, capital, and liquidity standards. Bank regulatory agencies are expected to be more active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders. In addition, new laws,\nregulations, and other regulatory changes may also increase our compliance costs and affect our business and operations. Moreover, the FDIC sets the cost of our FDIC insurance premiums, which can affect our profitability.\nThe Company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Regulatory capital requirements and their impact on the Company may change. It may need to raise additional capital in the future to support operations and continued growth. Our ability to raise capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it could affect operations and the execution of the strategic plan, which includes further expanding operations through internal growth and acquisitions.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of insured depository institutions. In addition to eliminating the OTS and creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directs changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, mandates the imposition of consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies, requires originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, stipulates regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repeals restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The impact of many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is ongoing as further regulations are promulgated. The Company expects that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Company. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which the Company does business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nNew Federal Bank Capital Rules May Affect the Company\u2019s Future Condition and Performance.\nIn July 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFRB\u201d), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) announced the adoption of new rules that revise and replace the agencies\u2019 capital rules as these federal agencies move forward with implementing capital requirements in response to agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel III\u201d). Many of these rules became effective on January 1, 2015 and some of the rules are being implemented in a phased transition which will be completed in 2019. The Company expects that these rules will make some investments in earning assets less attractive and that overall measures of capital adequacy will be reduced but will remain Well Capitalized. The new capital rules phase in certain buffers which, if not maintained, could result in limitations on certain distributions to management and shareholders. The Company expects that such buffers will be maintained. The implementation of the new capital rules is extensive and some aspects of interpretation and guidance have been delayed until close to implementation dates, increasing the uncertainty related to capital planning. The Company has a high focus on the ongoing assessment of these new capital rules as they become effective, including the impact on capital sources and capital returns.\nProvisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware Law, as Well as State and Federal Banking Regulations, Could Delay or Prevent a Takeover of Us by a Third Party.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware, and state and federal regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions include: limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock; supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, we are subject to Delaware laws, including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy\ncontests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAcquisitions Have Resulted in Significant Goodwill, Which if it Becomes Impaired Would be Required to be Written Down, Resulting in a Negative Impact on Earnings.\nThe initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired. Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates. It is possible that future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets, or both. If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and adjusted deposit intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels. These are non-GAAP financial measures. They are not a substitute for GAAP measures and should only be considered in conjunction with the Company\u2019s GAAP financial information.\nTrading of our Common Stock\nThe Trading History of The Company\u2019s Common Stock Is Characterized By Low Trading Volume. The Value of Your Investment May be Subject To Sudden Decreases Due To the Volatility of the Price of Our Common Stock.\nThe level of interest and trading in the Company\u2019s stock depends on many factors beyond our control. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results; changes in interest rates; changes in the legal or regulatory environment; press releases, announcements or publicity relating to the Company or its competitors or relating to trends in its industry; changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors; future sales of our common stock; changes in economic conditions in our marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and other developments affecting our competitors or us. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent stockholders from selling their common stock at a desirable price.\nIn the past, stockholders have brought securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We could be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nPending Agreement to Acquire Hampden Bancorp\nLegal Proceedings Commenced After the Announcement of the Merger May Delay Consummation of the Merger, Result in Increased Expenditures and Consume the Time and Attention of Our Executive Officers.\nA complaint has been filed against Hampden, the Hampden board of directors and Berkshire, seeking class action status and asserting that Hampden and the Hampden board of directors violated their fiduciary duties to Hampden stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger. The complaint further alleged that Berkshire aided and abetted Hampden and the Hampden board of directors in their alleged breach of fiduciary duties. Berkshire is vigorously defending itself against these claims. At this time, Berkshire is unable to predict an outcome, favorable or unfavorable, or to estimate the amount of any potential loss. Legal proceedings of this type are costly to defend and may consume the time and attention of our executive officers, as well as delay the consummation of the Merger.\nFailure to Complete the Merger Could Negatively Impact the Stock prices and Future Businesses and Financial results of Berkshire and Hampden.\nIf the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Berkshire and Hampden may be adversely affected and Berkshire and Hampden will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 Berkshire and Hampden will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u00b7 under the merger agreement, Hampden is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies; and\n\u00b7 matters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by Berkshire and Hampden management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Berkshire and Hampden as independent companies, as the case may be.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, Berkshire and/or Hampden may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from their respective customers and employees. Berkshire and/or Hampden also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Berkshire or Hampden to perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, Berkshire and Hampden cannot assure their shareholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect the business, financial results and stock prices of Berkshire and/or Hampden.\nThe Company May be Unable to Successfully Integrate Hampden\u2019s Operations or Otherwise Realize the Expected Benefits from the Merger, Which Would Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe merger of Hampden with and into the Company involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently. The difficulties of combining the operations of the two companies include:\n\u00b7 integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds;\n\u00b7 combining different corporate cultures; and\n\u00b7 retaining key employees.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the business and the loss of key personnel. The integration of the two companies will require the experience and expertise of certain key employees of Hampden who are expected to be retained by the Company. The Company may not be successful in retaining these employees for the time period necessary to successfully integrate Hampden\u2019s operations with those of the Company. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delay or difficulty encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operation of the Company following the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the business of the Company with Hampden. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate Hampden, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. For example, the Company may fail to realize the anticipated increase in earning and cost savings anticipated to be derived from the acquisition. In addition, as with regard to any merger, a significant decline in asset valuations or cash flows may also cause the Company not to realize expected benefits.", "PERMNO": 88280, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BHLB"}
