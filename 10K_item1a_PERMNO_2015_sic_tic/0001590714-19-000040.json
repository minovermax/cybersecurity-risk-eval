{"cik": "1590714", "company": "Element Solutions Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe ownership of our securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this 2018 Annual Report before deciding whether to invest in our Company. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us or our operating businesses. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business\nNew Identity and Corporate Structure\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the Arysta Sale, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and trading price.\nOn January 31, 2019, we completed the Arysta Sale. We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all for a variety of reasons, including that following the Arysta Sale, we are a smaller and less diversified company with a narrower business focus. As a result, we are more vulnerable to changing market conditions. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Arysta Sale, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or trading price may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, in connection with the Arysta Sale, we agreed to retain certain liabilities, as described under Note 5. Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2018 Annual Report. We cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of these matters which involve judgments that are inherently subjective, and there can be no assurance that such resolution, which may take several years, will not adversely impact our financial position or results of operations.\nUpon closing of the Arysta Sale, we initiated a reorganization of our corporate structure, which could negatively impact our performance.\nUpon the closing of the Arysta Sale, we initiated the implementation of a corporate reorganization that is intended to reduce operating costs by combining certain of our corporate functions with those of our former Performance Solutions segment. This reorganization could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of key personnel. We cannot guarantee that this new company structure will succeed or that we will be effective in executing the reorganization. Further, even if the reorganization is successful, we cannot guarantee that the new company structure will generate the cost savings and efficiencies that we anticipate. Failure to implement the reorganization or the new company structure successfully, on a timely basis, or at all, or failure to realize all, or any, of their intended benefits, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOperations, Markets and Competition\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate and, as a result, we may suffer pricing pressure and reduced margins, or our products may be unable to achieve market acceptance.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, have experienced ongoing consolidation among major specialty chemicals companies and are driven by consumer preferences that are rapidly changing as well as frequent new product introductions and improvements. We also encounter competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater brand recognition, and a larger base of customers than we do. As a result, we may lose business if we are unable to devote greater resources to the research and development, manufacturing, formulation, promotion, sale or support of our products, withstand adverse changes in economic conditions within the relevant industry or the prices of raw materials, and/or maintain competitive pricing. In addition, our competitors could enter into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers, which could limit our ability to acquire necessary raw materials or to generate sales and/or significantly increase costs.\nOur operating results are also influenced in part by our ability to introduce new products and services that offer distinct value to our customers, particularly prior to our competitors' ability to introduce equivalent products. We seek to provide tailored products for our customers\u2019 often unique problems, which require an ongoing level of innovation. Even where we devote significant human and financial resources to develop new technologically advanced products and services, we may not be successful in these efforts. If we are not able to continue technological innovation and successful commercial introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other producers to meet their requirements. Furthermore, if our competitors are able to introduce equivalent products\nbefore we are able to bring new products to market, we may lose market share to our competitors. Any of these factors may impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to adapt to changes in market needs, our future ability to penetrate markets and sustain our market position could be adversely affected.\nIf we don't successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services, our business and financial performance may suffer.\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services, as well as introducing new products and services, to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape. To successfully execute this strategy, we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong, identify and capitalize on organic growth, and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe process of developing new high-technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and our inability to anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition. We must make long-term investments, develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual property, and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. Any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance. Our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding and/or personnel.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change. Even if we successfully develop new products and technologies, future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances, and end-user requirements and preferences. We may also be unable to timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones. In addition, our competitors may create products that replace ours. As a result, any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical. After we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product\u2019s lifecycle or at all. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.\nIf we acquire, combine with or divest other businesses, we will face certain risks inherent in such transactions.\nWe have in the past completed several acquisitions and dispositions, and will continue, from time to time, to consider opportunistic strategic transactions, which could involve acquisitions, combinations or dispositions of businesses or assets. Any such strategic combination could be material, be difficult to implement and/or disrupt our business. In addition, these transactions could involve certain risks, including:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the acquired businesses or separating businesses to be disposed of;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown and/or contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with any acquisition and/or disposition;\n\u2022\npotential tax costs or inefficiencies, inconsistencies or deficiencies in standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting, environmental compliance and health and safety compliance), information technology systems, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating and retaining key employees, customers, suppliers and other partners of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nchallenges related to the lack of experience in operating in the geographical or product markets of the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nreputational or other damages to our business as a result of a failure to consummate such a transaction for, among other reasons, failure to gain anti-trust approval.\nIf we enter into significant strategic transactions in the future, related accounting charges may affect our financial condition and results of operations, particularly in the case of any acquisitions. In addition, the financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Conversely, any material disposition could reduce our indebtedness or require the amendment or refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness or a portion thereof. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any strategic transactions.\nThere can be no assurance that any future acquisitions or dispositions we make or any business combination we enter into will be completed in a timely manner, or at all, that they will be structured or financed in a way that will enhance our creditworthiness or that they will meet our strategic objectives or otherwise be successful. We also may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational, financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these transactions. Finally, future business acquisitions, divestiture or other material strategic initiatives could compound the difficulty in making comparisons between prior, current and future periods because these events, which are not made in ordinary course of business, also affect our gross profit margins and our overall operating results. Failure to effectively manage any of these transactions could result in material increases in costs or reductions in expected revenues, or both. In addition, if any new acquired business does not progress as planned, we may not recover the funds and resources we have expended and this could have a negative impact on our businesses or our company as a whole.\nIndustry and consumer trends may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe specialty chemical industry in general, and the printing industry in particular, are cyclical and subject to constant and rapid technological change, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, short product lifecycles, raw material price fluctuations, and changes in product supply and demand. For example, demand for our products and services in the automotive industry may be affected by technological advances, changing automotive OEM specifications and other factors we cannot control. In addition, our specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers. Changes, including technological changes, in our customers\u2019 products or processes may make our specialty chemicals unnecessary. Customers also have found, and may continue to find, alternative materials or processes which no longer require our products. Finally, the specialty chemical industry is currently being affected by globalization and a shift in customers\u2019 businesses while the printing industry is currently shrinking. All these factors, consumer trends and industry characteristics may impact the demand for our products which may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe failure to attract and retain key personnel, including our executive officers, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business involves complex operations and therefore demands a leadership team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable and expert in many areas necessary for our operations. The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse material impact on our result of operations. In addition, we are highly dependent on the experience and track records of Martin E. Franklin, the other Board members and our executive leadership team. If one or more of our executive officers were to cease to be employed by us, or if we were unable to replace them in a timely manner, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, as a company focused on manufacturing and highly technical customer service, we rely on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees, including our specialized research and development, and sales and service personnel, in order to maintain our efficient production processes, drive innovation in our product offerings and maintain our deep customer relationships. The departure of a significant number of our highly skilled employees, or of one or more employees who hold key management positions, could have an adverse impact on our operations, including customers choosing to follow an employee or manager to one of our competitors.\nVolatility and increases in the price of raw materials, energy and transportation could harm our profits.\nWe use a variety of specialty and commodity chemicals in our formulation processes, and such formulation operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. We typically purchase our major raw materials on a contract or as needed basis from outside sources. The availability and prices of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, the financial stability of our suppliers, new laws or regulations, protectionist nationalistic trade policies and practices, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels. In some cases, we are limited in our ability to purchase certain raw materials from other suppliers by our supply agreements which contain certain minimum purchase requirements. An inability to obtain major raw materials could adversely impact our ability to produce products.\nSimilarly, commodities and energy prices are subject to volatility caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, and other world events. As we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control, if the cost of energy, shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along those costs to our customers, our profit margins would be adversely impacted. Furthermore, increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients, which could have an adverse long-term impact on our results of operations.\nOur reliance on certain key customers, contract manufacturers, suppliers or independent distributors could adversely affect our overall sales and profitability.\nAlthough we believe our business is not materially dependent upon any single customer, we rely on certain key customers, the loss of which may impair our results of operations for the affected earnings periods. The principal products purchased by such customers are surface finishing chemicals and solid sheet printing elements. In addition, there is limited available manufacturing capacity that meets our quality standards and regulatory requirements. If we are unable to arrange for sufficient production capacity among our contract manufacturers or suppliers, or if our contract manufacturers or suppliers encounter production, quality, financial, or other difficulties (including labor or geopolitical disturbances), we may encounter difficulty in meeting customer demands. In addition, we rely on independent distributors to distribute our products and to assist us with the marketing and sale of certain of our products, locally and globally. There can be no assurance that our distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products to end users, or will be successful in selling our products, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIntellectual Property and Information Security\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights and the rights to our proprietary processes, methods, compounds and other technology. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies and our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of one or more competitive advances and decreased sales. In addition, the laws of other countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nIn some cases, we rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third-parties to protect our intellectual property, our confidentiality agreements could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for or adequate remedies to protect our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information.\nDespite efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may attempt to access, divert or use our intellectual property without authorization. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, technology and other proprietary rights is difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will prevent or minimize the risks of such unauthorized use. In addition, our intellectual property strategy must continually evolve to protect our proprietary rights in new solutions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could also result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation.\nWe may incur significant costs in response to claims by others that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.\nFrom time to time, third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation or other proceedings related to patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our business. Many of our competitors have a substantial amount of intellectual property that we must continually monitor to avoid infringement. From time to time, we also oppose patent applications that we consider overbroad or otherwise invalid in order to maintain the ability to operate freely in our various business lines without the risk of being sued for patent infringement. We could be adversely affected by litigation, other proceedings or claims against us, as well as claims against our manufacturers, suppliers or customers, alleging infringement of third-party proprietary rights by our products and technology, or components thereof. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel, and result in costly litigation. These claims, if successful, could require us to:\n\u2022\npay substantial damages or royalties;\n\u2022\ncomply with an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering certain of our products;\n\u2022\nseek a license for the use of certain intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n\u2022\ndevelop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and ultimately may not be successful; and\n\u2022\nindemnify our customer and other third parties pursuant to contractual obligations to hold them harmless or pay expenses or damages on their behalf.\nAny of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may increase as a result of acquisitions, as we would have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology and the steps taken to safeguard against the risks of infringing the rights of third parties.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information technology systems throughout the Company to control our manufacturing processes, process orders, manage inventory, process and bill shipments to and collect cash from our customers. We also depend on these systems to respond to customer inquiries, contribute to our overall internal control processes, maintain records of our property, plant and equipment and record and pay amounts due to vendors and other creditors. As we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality and other problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business operations and internal control processes could also be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately. The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.\nChanges in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely impact our business.\nOur business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally designed to protect the privacy of clients, customers, employees and other third parties. The interpretation and application of such laws and regulations is uncertain and evolving and it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018, applies to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable information of residents of E.U. countries. The GDPR created a range of new compliance obligations, and imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. It is possible that the GDPR may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us, unforeseen by us, or otherwise inconsistent with our practices; or that we may otherwise fail to construe its requirements in ways that are satisfactory to the E.U. authorities.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the GDPR, or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, including but not limited to privacy, data protection, information security, or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations, in one or more jurisdictions within the E.U. or elsewhere, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or individuals; subject us to significant fines, penalties, and/or judgments; require us to change our business practices; limit access to our products and services in certain countries, or otherwise adversely affect our business, as we would be at risk to lose both customers and revenue, and incur substantial costs.\nThe risk of loss of our intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive business or customer confidential information or disruption of operations due to breaches of cybersecurity could negatively impact our financial results.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in our operations or harm our reputation. We have important assets, including intellectual property, trade secrets and other sensitive, business critical and/or confidential information. A significant cyber-attack could result in the loss of critical business or confidential information and/or could negatively impact operations, which could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nDespite our efforts to protect sensitive information and comply with and implement data security measures, there can be no assurance that any controls and procedures that we have in place will be sufficient to protect us from future security breaches. As cyber threats are continually evolving, our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modifying or enhancing our systems in the future. We may also be required to expend resources to remediate cyber-related incidents or to enhance and strengthen our cyber security. Any such disruptions to our information\ntechnology systems, breaches or compromises of data, and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, negative publicity, litigation, violation of privacy and other laws, or business delays that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGlobal Operations and Regulations\nOur substantial international operations subject us to risks not faced by domestic competitors.\nOur products are manufactured and formulated, distributed or sold globally. The risks inherent in international trade may reduce our international sales and harm our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency values and foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariff regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war, terrorism and other political risks;\n\u2022\nadditional withholding taxes or other taxes on foreign income;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange controls or other currency restrictions and limitation on the movement of funds, including the prohibition of the repatriation of funds into the United States;\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining relationships with local distributors and OEMs;\n\u2022\nthe effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations and potential boycotts;\n\u2022\ninstability in European countries and negative impact on the global economy as a result of the United Kingdom's formal trigger of the process for its exit from the E.U., and related negotiations;\n\u2022\nimport and export control and licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nbusiness cultures accepting of various levels of corruption;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of U.S. laws, including the FCPA and the Bribery Act, by us or our employees, suppliers, distributors and wholesalers;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property than in the U.S.;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in maintaining an effective internal control environment, including language and cultural differences, varying levels of GAAP expertise and internal control over financial reporting.\nAny of these risks could impact our ability to manufacture, source, sell or export our products or repatriate profits. We could also experience a loss of sales and profitability from our international operations, and/or a substantial impairment or loss of assets, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the E.U. may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" and in March 2017, notified the E.U. that it intended to exit as provided in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The terms of the withdrawal are subject to ongoing negotiation that has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the E.U. It is possible that the level of economic activity in this region will be adversely impacted and that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities, including those relating to tax, trade, security and employees. The measures could potentially disrupt some of our target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate, and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, Brexit could lead to economic uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and cause our customers and potential customers to monitor their costs and reduce their budgets for either our products or other products that incorporate our products. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur net sales and gross profit have varied depending on our product, customer and geographic mix for any given period, which makes it difficult to forecast future operating results.\nOur net sales and gross profit vary among our products, customers and markets, and therefore may be different in future periods from historic or current periods. Overall gross profit margins in any given period are dependent in large part on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period\u2019s net sales. Market trends, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory conditions and other factors may also result in reductions in revenue or pressure on the gross profit margins in a given period. The varying nature of our product, customer and geographic mix between periods has materially impacted our net sales and gross profit between periods during certain recessionary times and may lead to difficulties in measuring the potential impact of market, regulatory and other factors on our business. As a result, we may be challenged in our ability to forecast our future operating results.\nWe are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and legal developments involving taxes which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state, and other countries' and jurisdictions', income, payroll, property, sales and use, and other types of taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities may require significant judgment in determining the appropriate provision and related accruals for these taxes; and as a result, such changes could result in substantially higher taxes and, therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on our results or operations, financial conditions and liquidity.\nCurrently, a significant amount of our net sales are generated from customers located outside of the United States, and a large portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the United States. The United States, the E.U. and member states along with numerous other countries are currently engaged in establishing fundamental changes to tax laws affecting the taxation of multinational corporations. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the TCJA which significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings, limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. The TCJA is complex and subject to interpretation, and we continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. The presentation of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the TCJA. However, we expect to continue to see future regulations relating to, and interpretive guidance of, the legislation contained in the TCJA. The full extent of the impact remains uncertain at this time, and our current interpretations of, and assumptions regarding, the TCJA are subject to additional regulatory or administrative developments, including any future regulations or other guidance promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such legislation from any future regulations or interpretive guidance could adversely affect our financial position, income tax provision, net income or cash flows.\nIn addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax authorities in the countries and jurisdictions in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in our historical financial statements. An audit or litigation can result in significant additional income taxes payable in the jurisdictions in which we operate which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChemical manufacturing is inherently hazardous and may result in accidents, which may disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses or liabilities.\nThe hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes are inherent in our operations as our research and development, manufacturing, formulating and packaging activities involve the use of hazardous materials and the generation of hazardous waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination, discharge or injury resulting from those materials. Also, our suppliers or contract manufacturers may use and/or generate hazardous materials in connection with producing our products. We may be required to indemnify our suppliers, contract manufacturers or waste disposal contractors against damages and other liabilities arising out of the production, handling or storage of our products or raw materials or the disposal of related wastes. Potential risks include explosions and fires, chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures. Those hazards may result in personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which may result in a suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions, cleanup costs, and claims by governmental\nentities or third-parties. We are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities (including third-party manufacturing on a tolling basis), and the loss or shutdown of operations over an extended period could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations currently use, and have historically used, hazardous materials and generate, and have historically generated, quantities of hazardous waste. For example, we are subject to regulatory oversight and investigation, remediation, and monitoring obligations at our current and former Superfund sites, as well as third-party disposal sites, under federal laws and their state and local analogues, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as analogous foreign laws. In particular, we are subject to ongoing obligations at active sites in the United States and are conducting closure activities pursuant to the RCRA at several sites in the United States. The costs and liabilities associated with these issues may be substantial and may materially impact the financial health of our company.\nWe may incur material costs relating to environmental and health and safety requirements or liabilities, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the environment and the generation, use, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Our operations bear the risk of violations of those laws and sanctions for violations such as clean-up and removal costs, long-term monitoring and maintenance costs, costs of waste disposal, fines for natural resource damage, and payments for property damage and personal injury. Additionally, those requirements, and enforcement of those requirements, may become more stringent in the future. The ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements could be material. We have incurred, are incurring and will incur in the future, costs and capital expenditures in complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Although it is our policy to comply with such laws and regulations, it is possible that we have not been or may not be at all times in material compliance with all of those requirements.\nAt any given time, we may be involved in claims, litigation, administrative proceedings, settlements and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities. In particular, we are currently involved in various investigations due to historic operations. Liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be joint and several and imposed retroactively, regardless of fault or the legality of the activities that gave rise to the contamination. Some of our formulating and manufacturing facilities have an extended history of chemical formulating and manufacturing operations or other industrial activities, and contaminants have been detected at some of our sites and offsite disposal locations. Ultimate environmental costs are difficult to predict and may vary from current estimates and liabilities. The discovery of additional contaminants, the inability or failure of other liable parties to satisfy their obligations, the imposition of additional cleanup obligations, or the commencement of related third-party claims could result in significant additional costs and negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur offshore oil industry products are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oil production and drilling industry, and we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards.\nWe produce water-based hydraulic control fluids for major oil companies and drilling contractors to be used for potentially hazardous offshore deepwater production and drilling applications. Offshore deepwater oil production and drilling are subject to hazards that include blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, capsizing, sinking and damage or loss to pipeline, subsea or other facilities from severe weather conditions. Those hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. A catastrophic occurrence at a location where our products are used may expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, product liability or commercial claims. To the extent available, we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is customary in our industry. Such insurance does not, however, provide coverage for all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant offshore deepwater oil production or drilling event that results in liability to us that is not fully insured could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our products may be subject to various export control regulations and exports may require a license from the U.S. Department of State or the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nCompanies must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services, and technology. In the United States, these laws include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), administered by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Some of our products or technology may have military or strategic applications governed by the ITAR or represent so-called \u201cdual use\u201d items governed by the EAR. As a result, these products may require government licenses to be exported to certain jurisdictions or persons. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the FCPA and other similar anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the Bribery Act, which prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. Under the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and many other anti-corruption laws, companies may also be held liable for actions taken by third-parties acting on their behalf, such as strategic or local partners or representatives. Certain anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, also prohibit commercial bribery and the receipt of bribes, while others, such as the FCPA, require companies to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. Certain of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business are perceived to have a heightened risk for corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other improper practices. Our businesses prohibit bribery and unethical conduct, but these policies may not prevent our employees or agents from violating these laws. Failure by us or our intermediaries to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, governmental authorities in the United States or elsewhere, as applicable, may result in civil and/or criminal penalties against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibition on the conduct of our business, which could all damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are subject to numerous, complex government regulations dealing with the production and sale of chemicals and compliance with these regulations could require us to incur additional costs or to reformulate or discontinue certain of our products.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign customs regulations, imports and international trade laws, export control, antitrust laws, environmental and chemicals manufacturing, global climate change, health and safety requirements and zoning and occupancy laws that regulate manufacturers generally or govern the importation, promotion and sale of our products, the operation of factories and warehouse facilities and our relationship with our customers, suppliers and competitors. Our products and manufacturing processes are also subject to ongoing reviews by certain governmental authorities.\nNumerous laws regulating the production and marketing of chemical substances apply to us. These regulations include, for example, the European Union REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation, the REACH regulation\u2019s Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) program and similar laws in other jurisdictions. These regulations may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials, which could have an adverse impact on the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or other similar effects, which could materially alter our marketplace position or otherwise have a material financial effect on our revenues. We also have several product lines that currently rely on lead-based solder and many others that historically did so. Legal claims have been brought alleging harmful exposures or contamination as a result of lead-based solder, and it is possible that we may face additional claims in the future.\nIn addition, pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC has promulgated rules requiring disclosure regarding the use of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals. Complying with these disclosure requirements involves substantial diligence efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and may require third-party auditing of our diligence process. These efforts may demand internal resources that would otherwise be directed towards operations activities. Since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the conflict minerals used in our products. Additionally, if we are unable to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are determined to be conflict free, they may choose a competitor\u2019s products which could materially impact our financial condition and operating results.\nThe requirements described above, and enforcement of those requirements, may become more stringent in the future. The ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements could be material. Changes in environmental and climate laws or regulations could lead to new or additional investment in production designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, for us and our suppliers. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to expend significant funds to comply with, or discharge liabilities arising in the future under, environmental laws, regulations and permits, or that we will not be exposed to material environmental, health or safety litigation. Some of our formulating and manufacturing facilities have an extended history of chemical formulating and manufacturing operations or other industrial activities, and contaminants have been detected at some of our sites and offsite disposal locations. Ultimate environmental costs are difficult to predict and may vary from current estimates and liabilities. The discovery of additional contaminants, the inability or failure of other liable parties to satisfy their obligations, the imposition of additional cleanup obligations, or the commencement of related third-party claims could result in significant additional costs.\nWe may be unable to ensure compliance with international trade restrictions and economic sanctions laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have operations, assets and/or make sales in countries all over the world, including countries that are or may become the target of the United States and other countries\u2019 trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, which we refer to collectively as \u201cEconomic Sanctions Laws.\u201d Economic Sanctions Laws are complex and change with time as international relationships and confrontations between and among nations evolve. For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the U.S. State Department administer certain laws and regulations that impose penalties upon U.S. persons and entities and, in some instances, non-U.S. entities, for conducting activities or transacting business with certain countries, governments, entities, or individuals subject to U.S. Economic Sanctions Laws. We do not unlawfully conduct business in any sanctioned countries but given the breadth of our international operations and the scope of our sales globally, including via third-party distributors over whom we may have limited or no control, coupled with the complexity and ever-changing nature of Economic Sanctions Laws, there can be no assurance that we have been in the past or will at all times in the future be in full compliance. If we fail to comply with Economic Sanctions Laws, investigations and/or actions could be taken against us that could materially and adversely affect our reputation or have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure\nFinancial Performance\nIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any material changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. We have in the past experienced, and in the future may experience again, material weaknesses and potential problems in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required by the SEC. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and the NYSE, we could face severe consequences from those authorities, and our reputation could be harmed which in turn could affect the value of our securities.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. We have substantial assets, liabilities, revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. Although we may employ at times a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities, we cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective, and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nChanges in the method for determining LIBOR and/or the potential replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of concerns about the accuracy of the calculation of LIBOR, a number of British Bankers\u2019 Association, or BBA, member banks entered into settlements with certain regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to the alleged manipulation of LIBOR. Actions by the BBA, regulators or law enforcement agencies as a result of these or future events, may result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined. Potential changes, or uncertainty related to such potential changes may adversely affect the market for LIBOR-based securities, including our borrowings under the New Credit Agreement. In addition, changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market for LIBOR-based borrowings.\nIn July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S.-dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. Although there have been a few issuances utilizing SOFR or the Sterling Over Night Index Average, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is unknown whether these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate any borrowing under the New Credit Agreement extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital and net investment income cannot yet be determined.\nA change in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in an impairment charge, which could materially affect our results of operations.\nOur historical Acquisitions have resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible assets being recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are required under GAAP to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are also required to conduct impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently, if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that an other-than-temporary impairment exists. Other than the goodwill impairments in the Energy Solutions reporting unit in 2016, there were no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in 2018, 2017 or 2016 relating to our continuing operations. In 2018, the fair value of the Energy Solutions reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value. Any changes in estimates or underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations. Factors that could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to significant negative economic or industry trends or competitive operating conditions; significant macroeconomic conditions that may result in an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value; and significant changes in the nature and timing of decisions regarding assets or markets that do not perform consistently with our expectations, including factors we use to estimate future levels of sales, Adjusted EBITDA or cash flows. Future impairment charges, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods recognized.\nIndebtedness\nOur New Credit Agreement and other debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nWe are a party to the New Credit Agreement which provides for new senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.08 billion, consisting of a revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of $330 million maturing in 2024 and a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million maturing in 2026. On the closing date of the Arysta Sale, the $750 million term loan was borrowed under the New Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement and other agreements governing our outstanding debt contain covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to grant liens, pay cash dividends, enter new lines of business, repurchase our shares of common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. In addition, the New Credit Agreement and these agreements include customary remedies, including the right of the lenders to take action with respect to the collateral securing outstanding loans, that would apply should we default or otherwise be unable to satisfy our debt obligations. These covenants restrict our flexibility in operating our business. As a result, we may be unable to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous, meet extraordinary capital needs, finance future operations, plan for or react to market conditions, or otherwise take actions that we believe are in the best interest of our business which, in turn, may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant indebtedness in the future, which would result in additional restrictions upon our business and impact our financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant indebtedness in the future. Although the New Credit Agreement and other agreements governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Any significant indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have the following material consequences:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease the amount of our interest expense, because our borrowings include instruments with variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, would result in higher interest expense;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make strategic acquisitions, introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nWe may also enter into additional debt transactions or credit facilities, including equipment loans, working capital lines of credit, senior notes and other long-term debt, which may increase our indebtedness and result in additional restrictions upon our business. In addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate our debt based on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock and Senior Notes\nWe have numerous equity instruments outstanding that could require us to issue additional shares of common stock. The future issuance of additional shares could result in significant dilution of ownership interests and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have a number of equity instruments outstanding that could require us to issue additional shares of our common stock. Depending on the equity instrument, these additional shares may either be issued for no additional consideration or based on a fixed amount of additional consideration. Specifically, at December 31, 2018, we had outstanding the following:\n\u2022\n4,019,679 exchange rights which require us to issue shares of our common stock in exchange for shares of common stock of our subsidiary, PDH, on a one-for-one basis, at any time at the option of the holder;\n\u2022\n2,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are convertible into shares of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis, at any time at the option of the holder;\n\u2022\n3,353,871 RSUs which were granted to employees under our 2013 Plan. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of our common stock;\n\u2022\n536,772 options which are exercisable to purchase shares of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis, at any time at the option of the holder;\n\u2022\n$100 million of contingent consideration agreed upon in connection with the MacDermid Acquisition which, at our option, may be paid in shares of our common stock.\nWe have 10,124,581 shares of our common stock currently available under the 2013 Plan, net of the outstanding RSUs and options noted above (subject to increase in accordance with the terms of such plan), and an additional 4,720,094 shares of our common stock currently available under the ESPP.\nIn addition, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive an annual dividend on their Series A Preferred Stock in the form of shares of our common stock. For 2018, no stock dividend was declared with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. The dividend amount is calculated based on the appreciated stock price compared to the highest dividend price previously used in calculating the Series A Preferred Stock dividends, which is currently $22.85. The issuance of common stock as stock dividends in the future could have a dilutive impact on, and reduce the value of, our outstanding common stock.\nVolatility of our stock price could adversely affect our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in net sales or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;\n\u2022\noperating and securities price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our businesses;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, including potential future acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring or other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;\n\u2022\nthe reaction of the investment community to our shares repurchases;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political events and/or conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe risk factors set forth in this 2018 Annual Report and other matters discussed herein.\nFluctuations in the price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of a stockholder\u2019s investment in our Company. Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of the financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of us and our subsidiaries. Repurchases of our shares of common stock would also reduce the number of our outstanding shares and might incrementally increase the potential for volatility in our stock by reducing the potential volumes at which our shares may trade in the public markets. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nIf any of our executive officers, directors or stockholders sells a large number of shares of our common stock, or if we issue a large number of shares of common stock in connection with future acquisitions, financings or other circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Moreover, the perception in the public market that we or our stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of those shares.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our shares of common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of our shares will have on the market price of such shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our shares, including sales by significant stockholders, and shares issued in connection with any pending or future acquisition, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock. Possible sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price we deem necessary or appropriate.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur Board is authorized to create and issue one or more additional series of preferred stock, and, with respect to each series, to determine the number of shares constituting the series and the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, which may include dividend rights, conversion or exchange rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms and liquidation preferences, without stockholder approval. If we create and issue one or more additional series of preferred stock, it could affect the rights of our common stockholders or reduce the value of our outstanding common stock. Our Board could, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and which could have certain anti-takeover effects.\nWe have redeemed in the past, and may continue to redeem or repurchase, outstanding series of debt securities, which could impact the market for our senior notes and/or negatively affect our liquidity.\nWe may from time to time seek to repurchase, redeem or refinance our outstanding senior notes in open market purchases, accelerated repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, partial or full calls for redemption or otherwise. Any such repurchases or redemptions and the timing and amount thereof would depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Depending on such timing and amount, our liquidity could be negatively affected.\nOur principal source of operating cash is income received from our subsidiaries.\nWe do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries. Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to pay dividends is highly dependent on the earnings of, and receipt of funds from, our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans, in particular from MacDermid, Incorporated. As a result, we are dependent on the income generated by our subsidiaries to meet our expenses and operating cash requirements. The amount of distributions and dividends, if any, which may be paid to us from each of our subsidiaries will depend on many factors, including the results of operations and financial condition, limits on dividends under applicable law, such subsidiary's constitutional documents, documents governing any indebtedness of such subsidiary, and other factors which may be outside our control. If our subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may be unable to pay our expenses.\nWe are governed by Delaware law, which has anti-takeover implications.\nWe are governed by Delaware law, the application of which may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts or a change in control. In particular, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. A Delaware corporation may opt out of that provision either with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or in an amendment to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws approved by its stockholders. We have not opted out of this provision. Section 203 could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us, which may negatively affect our stock price.", "PERMNO": 14406, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "ESI"}
