{"cik": "1499961", "company": "Net Element, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Report, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the preceding \u201cBusiness\u201d section of this Report, before engaging in any transaction in our securities. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects, and cause the value of our securities to decline, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur financial condition creates doubt as to whether we will continue as a going concern. If we do not continue as a going concern, investors may lose their entire investment.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We sustained a net loss of approximately $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and an accumulated deficit of approximately $144.0 million at December 31, 2015. While we had negative working capital of approximately $3.1 million at December 31, 2015, our current assets at December 31, 2015 included $5.2 million of accounts receivable and advances to aggregators. As of the filing date of this Report with the SEC, management expects that our cash flows from operations and remaining unrestricted cash will not be sufficient to fund our current operations through 2016. We will require additional capital in order to continue our existing business operations and to fund our obligations. We currently believe that we will require an additional $3.6 million in financing to continue operations as currently conducted, continue our payment processing businesses and to pay for other currently anticipated capital expenditures over the next 12 months.\nAdditional funds may be raised through debt financing and/or the issuance of equity securities, there being no assurance that any type of financing on terms satisfactory to us will be available or otherwise occur.\nDebt financing must be repaid regardless of whether we generate revenues or cash flows from operations and may be secured by substantially all of our assets. Any equity financing or debt financing that requires the issuance of equity securities or warrants to the lender would cause the percentage ownership by our current stockholders to be diluted, which dilution may be substantial. Also, any additional equity securities issued may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If such financings are not available when required or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or take advantage of business opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects and may ultimately require us to suspend or cease operations, which could cause investors to lose the entire amount of their investment.\nGlobal economic, political, and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer, business, and government spending, which may adversely impact the demand for our services and our revenue and profitability.\nFinancial services, payments, and technology industries in which we operate depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business, and government spending. A sustained deterioration in the general economic conditions (including distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies around the world, and additional government intervention), particularly in the United States or Europe, or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards. A reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease of our revenue and profits. The current threats to global economic growth include geopolitical instability in Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East and other oil producing countries. Instability in these regions could affect economic conditions in the Eurozone and the U.S.\nAdverse economic trends may accelerate the timing, or increase the impact of, risks to our financial performance. Such trends may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 Declining economies, foreign currency fluctuations, and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors, such as cross-border travel patterns, on which a significant portion of our revenues are dependent.\n\u00b7 Low levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high unemployment, may cause decreased spending by cardholders.\n\u00b7 Budgetary concerns in the United States and other countries around the world could affect the United States and other specific sovereign credit ratings, impact consumer confidence and spending, and increase the risks of operating in those countries.\n\u00b7 Emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in the United States and Europe, and adverse economic trends may be more pronounced in such emerging markets.\n\u00b7 Financial institutions may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate cardholder defaults.\n\u00b7 Uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients' businesses may make estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives, and realization of prepaid assets less predictable.\n\u00b7 Our clients may decrease spending for value-added services.\n\u00b7 Government intervention, including the effect of laws, regulations, and /or government investments in our clients, may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with our clients or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products.\nA weakening in the economy could also force some retailers to close, resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and declines in transactions, and reduced earnings on transactions due to a potential shift to large discount merchants. Additionally, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices. Changes in economic conditions could adversely impact our future revenues and profits and result in a downgrade of our debt ratings, which may lead to termination or modification of certain contracts and make it more difficult for us to obtain new business. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to changing industry trends and the needs and preferences of our clients and consumers may affect our competitiveness or demand for our products, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nFinancial services, payments, and technology industries are subject to rapid technological advancements, new products and services, including mobile payment applications, evolving competitive landscape, developing industry standards, and changing client and consumer needs and preferences. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the financial services, payments, and technology industries will continue to emerge. These changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Also, our clients and their customers continue to adopt new technology for business and personal uses. We must anticipate and respond to these changes in order to remain competitive within our relative markets. For example, our ability to provide innovative POS technology to our merchant clients could have an impact on our North America Transaction Solutions segment.\nFailure to develop value-added services that meet the needs and preferences of our clients could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete effectively in our industry. Furthermore, clients' and their customers' potential negative reaction to our products and services can spread quickly through social media and damage our reputation before we have the opportunity to respond. If we are unable to anticipate or respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely basis, our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected.\nSubstantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the financial services, payments, and technology industries may materially and adversely affect our overall business and operations.\nFinancial services, payments, and technology industries are highly competitive and our payment solutions compete against all forms of financial services and payment systems, including cash and checks, and electronic, mobile, and e-commerce payment platforms. If we are unable to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our clients and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively. Our competitors may introduce their own value-added or other services or solutions more effectively than we do, which could adversely impact our growth. We also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems, e-commerce payment systems, and payment systems for mobile devices. Failure to compete effectively against any of these competitive threats could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the highly competitive nature of our industry could lead to increased pricing pressure which could have a material impact on our overall business and results of operations.\nPotential changes in the competitive landscape, including disintermediation from other participants in the payments value chain, could harm our business.\nWe expect that the competitive landscape will continue to change, including:\n\u00b7 Rapid and significant changes in technology, resulting in new and innovative payment methods and programs that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our products.\n\u00b7 Competitors, clients, governments, and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace our value-added products and services.\n\u00b7 Participants in the financial services, payments, and technology industries may merge, create joint ventures, or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment services that compete with our services.\n\u00b7 New services and technologies that we develop may be impacted by industry-wide solutions and standards related to migration to EMV chip technology, tokenization, or other safety and security technologies.\nFailure to compete effectively against any of these competitive threats could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe market for our electronic commerce services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow rapidly enough for us to maintain and increase our profitability.\nIf the number of electronic commerce transactions does not continue to grow or if consumers or businesses do not continue to adopt our services, it could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We believe future growth in the electronic commerce market will be driven by the cost, ease-of-use, and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses. In order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability, consumers and businesses must continue to adopt our services, including our merchant suite, Aptito and PayOnline solutions.\nIf we cannot compete effectively, we will lose business.\nWe believe our mobile payment processing business is positioned to be competitive in our target markets. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our existing operations, or that our proposed future operations will be implemented successfully. Our principal competitive considerations include:\n\u00b7 financial resources to allocate to proper marketing and sales efforts;\n\u00b7 the ability to develop and maintain our operations, applications and technologies;\n\u00b7 the ability to effectively implement our business plans and strategies;\n\u00b7 establishing our brand name;\n\u00b7 financial resources to support working capital needs and required capital investments; and\n\u00b7 effects of sanctions on our business.\nWe rely on third-party processors and service providers; if they fail or no longer agree to provide their services, our merchant relationships could be adversely affected and we could lose business.\nWe rely on agreements with several large payment processing organizations to enable us to provide card authorization, data capture, settlement and merchant accounting services and access to various reporting tools for the merchants we serve. We also outsource to third parties other services, such as reorganizing and accumulating daily transaction data on a merchant-by-merchant and card issuer-by-card issuer basis and forwarding the accumulated data to the relevant bankcard associations. Many of these organizations and service providers are our competitors, and we do not have long-term contracts with most of them. Typically, our contracts with these third parties are for one-year and are subject to cancellation upon limited notice by either party. The termination by our service providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively may adversely affect our relationships with the merchants whose accounts we serve and may cause those merchants to terminate their processing agreements with us.\nWe rely on bank sponsors, which have substantial discretion with respect to certain elements of our business practices, in order to process bankcard transactions. If these sponsorships are terminated and we are not able to secure or successfully migrate merchant portfolios to new bank sponsors, we will not be able to conduct our business.\nBecause we are not a bank, we are unable to belong to and directly access the Visa and MasterCard bankcard associations. Visa and MasterCard operating regulations require us to be sponsored by a bank in order to process bankcard transactions. We are currently registered with Visa and MasterCard through the sponsorship of banks that are members of the card associations. The principal sponsoring bank through which we process the significant majority of our transactions is BMO Harris Bank. If our sponsorships are terminated and we are not able to secure or successfully migrate merchant portfolios to new bank sponsors, we will not be able to conduct our business.\nIf we or our bank sponsors fail to adhere to the standards of the Visa and MasterCard payment card associations, our registrations with these associations could be terminated, and we could be required to stop providing payment processing services for Visa and MasterCard.\nSubstantially all of the transactions we process involve Visa or MasterCard. If we or our bank sponsors fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the Visa or MasterCard payment card associations, Visa or MasterCard could suspend or terminate our registration. The termination of our registration or any changes in the Visa or MasterCard rules that would impair our registration could prevent us from providing transactional processing services.\nWe periodically experience increases in interchange and other related costs, and if we cannot pass these increases along to our merchants, our profit margins will decline.\nWe pay interchange fees and assessments to issuing banks through the card associations for each transaction we process using their credit and debit cards. From time to time, the card associations increase the interchange fees that they charge processors and the sponsoring banks. At their sole discretion, our sponsoring banks have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to us. In addition, our sponsoring banks may seek to increase their Visa and MasterCard sponsorship fees to us, all of which are based upon the dollar amount of the payment transactions we process. If we are not able to pass these fee increases along to merchants through corresponding increases in merchant discount, our profit margins will decline.\nOur products and services could become less competitive or obsolete if we fail to keep pace with rapidly changing technology.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards. Advances in technology may result in changing customer preferences for products and services and delivery formats and any such change in preferences may be rapid. Clients may choose to move or develop equivalent services in-house. If we fail to enhance our current products and services and develop new products and services in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, our business could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. We could experience delays while developing and introducing new products and services and product and service enhancements, due to difficulties developing models, acquiring data or adapting to particular operating environments. Software errors or other defect errors in our products and services could affect the ability of our products and services to work with other hardware or software products, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of our products or services and could materially adversely affect our reputation and our business prospects, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nTo acquire and retain merchant accounts, we depend on independent non-bank sales force that do not serve us exclusively.\nWe rely on the efforts of ISGs to market our services to merchants seeking to establish a credit card processing relationship. ISGs are companies that seek to introduce to us, as well as our competitors, newly established and existing small merchants, including retailers, restaurants and other service providers. Generally, our agreements with ISGs are not exclusive and they have the right to refer merchants to other providers of transaction payment processing services. Our failure to maintain our relationships with our existing ISGs and to recruit and establish new relationships with other ISGs could adversely affect our revenues and internal growth and increase our merchant attrition.\nUnauthorized disclosure of data, whether through cybersecurity breaches, computer viruses or otherwise, could expose us to liability, protracted and costly litigation and could damage our reputation.\nWe process, store and/or transmit sensitive data, such as names, addresses, credit or debit card numbers and bank account numbers, and we may have liability if we fail to protect this data in accordance with applicable laws and our clients\u2019 specifications. The loss of data could result in significant fines and sanctions by our clients or governmental bodies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These concerns about security are increased when we transmit information over the Internet. Computer viruses can be distributed and spread rapidly over the Internet and could infiltrate our systems, which might disrupt our services and make them unavailable. In addition, a significant cybersecurity breach could result in payment networks prohibiting us from processing transactions on their networks or the loss of clients. We have been in the past and could be in the future, subject to breaches of security by hackers. It is possible that our encryption of data and other protective measures may not prevent unauthorized access. Although we have not to date incurred material losses or liabilities as a result of those breaches, a future breach of our system may subject us to material losses or liability, including payment of fines and claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated credit or debit card or bank account information or other similar fraud claims. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity breach could harm our reputation and deter clients from using electronic payments generally and our services specifically, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits and/or result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under applicable laws or by our clients.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonality, and, if our revenues are below our seasonal norms during our historically stronger quarters, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns. Historically, revenues have been weaker during the first quarter of the calendar year and stronger during the second, third and fourth quarters. If, for any reason, our revenues are below seasonal norms during the second, third or fourth quarter, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nNew and potential governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to consumer information could adversely affect our ability to provide, or the value of, the services we currently provide to our merchants.\nDue to the increasing public concern over consumer privacy rights, governmental bodies in the United States and abroad have adopted, and are considering adopting, additional laws and regulations restricting the purchase, sale and sharing of personal information about customers. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires non-affiliated third-party service providers to financial institutions to take certain steps to ensure the privacy and security of consumer financial information. We believe our present activities fall under exceptions to the consumer notice and opt-out requirements contained in this law for third-party service providers to financial institutions. However, the laws governing privacy generally remain unsettled. Even in areas where there has been some legislative action, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other consumer statutes, it is difficult to determine whether and how existing and proposed privacy laws or changes to existing privacy laws will apply to our business. Limitations on our ability to access and use customer information could adversely affect our ability to provide the services we currently offer to our merchants or impair the value of these services.\nSeveral states have proposed legislation that would limit the use of personal information gathered using the Internet. Some proposals would require proprietary online service providers and website owners to establish privacy policies. Congress has also considered privacy legislation that could further regulate the use of consumer information obtained over the Internet or in other ways. Our compliance with these privacy laws and related regulations could materially affect our operations.\nChanges to existing laws or the passage of new laws could:\n\u00b7 create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our services;\n\u00b7 restrict or limit our ability to sell certain products and services to certain customers;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to collect and to use merchant and cardholder data; or\n\u00b7 increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased operating costs;\nAny changes to existing laws or the passage of new laws that have effects such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are required to pay federal, state or local taxes on transaction processing, it could negatively impact our profit margins.\nTransaction processing companies may become subject to federal, state or local taxation of certain portions of their fees charged to merchants for their services. Application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and taxing jurisdictions have not yet adopted uniform positions on this topic. If we are required to pay such taxes and are unable to pass this tax expense through to our merchant clients, or are unable to produce increased cash flow to offset such taxes, these taxes would negatively impact our profit margins.\nThe volume and amounts of the accounts receivable suitable for assignment to the lenders under our current factoring lines of credit as of the time we choose to draw under such facilities may vary, thus potentially reducing the amounts of such draws. Any such reductions may adversely affect our ability to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs.\nOur credit facilities are currently structured as factoring lines of credit. Pursuant to these credit facilities, we assign certain (but not all) of our trade receivables from mobile operators to our lenders. The amounts of our draws under such facilities from time to time will depend on the amounts of the accounts receivable suitable to the lenders under such credit facilities for such assignment as of the time we choose to draw under such facility. If we require access to immediate liquidity to meet our working capital requirements, our draws under our credit facilities to satisfy those needs could be potentially reduced (depending on the amounts of the accounts receivable suitable to the lenders as of the time of any such draw), which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our working capital and other liquidity needs.\nContinuing political instability in the Ukraine, sanctions against Russia, and Russia\u2019s response to those sanctions, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2014, the Crimea region of the Ukraine was annexed by Russia. In response to this annexation and subsequent hostilities aimed at the Ukraine, other nations, including the United States and the European Union, imposed evolving economic sanctions against Russia. U.S. and European concerns related to the political and military conditions in the region have prompted increasing levels of economic sanctions, targeting certain Russian companies in the finance, energy and defense industries and named Russian nationals that have been deemed to have direct involvement in destabilizing the situation in the Ukraine, as well as imposing restrictions on trading and access to capital markets (\u201cRussian Sanctions\u201d). In response, Russia announced its own trading sanctions against nations that implemented or supported the Russian Sanctions, including the United States and some European Union nations. Much of our present operations are being conducted in Russia. In the event that the United States\u2019 and the European Union\u2019s political relationships with Russia further deteriorate, it is possible that additional and even more severe sanctions could be imposed by the United States or European Union against Russia or that Russia could impose additional retaliatory measures in response to current or future Russian Sanctions. If this should happen, our electronic payments operations conducted in Russia could be scaled back or shut down, which may require additional funding to penetrate or expand alternative electronic payments markets outside of Russia. In addition, if sanctions imposed on Russia cause increases in interest rates in Russia, the number or average purchase amount of transactions in Russia made using electronic payments could be negatively affected, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, consumer purchases of discretionary items could generally decline in Russia due to the potential adverse effect sanctions and general political instability may have on disposable income in Russia. A reduction in the amount of consumer spending in Russia could result in a decrease in our revenue and negatively affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur management has identified continued material weaknesses in our internal controls as of December 31, 2015, which, if not properly remedied, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Report, our management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because there are a limited number of personnel employed and we cannot have an adequate segregation of duties, and due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below under \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\u201d Accordingly, management cannot provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective. Management works to mitigate these risks by being personally involved in all substantive transactions and attempts to obtain verification of transactions and accounting policies and treatments involving our operations, including those overseas. We are in the process of reviewing and, where necessary, modifying controls and procedures throughout the Company, particularly in light of our recent acquisitions and the continued integration of these businesses. We will continue to address deficiencies as resources permit.\nAcquisition activities could result in operating difficulties, dilution to our stockholders and other harmful consequences.\nWe have built our current business primarily through acquisitions of intellectual property and other assets, and we intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions in the future. On April 16, 2013, certain subsidiaries of TOT Group acquired substantially all of the business assets of Unified Payments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cUnified Payments\u201d), a provider of comprehensive turnkey, payment-processing solutions to small and medium size business owners (merchants) and independent sales organizations across the United States. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this acquisition. Subsequently, on June 24, 2013, TOT Group, through its newly formed subsidiary Aptito, LLC (\u201cAptito\u201d), acquired substantially all of the business assets of Aptito.com, Inc., a New York corporation, a new generation of smart, customer engaged, patent-pending payments platform, m-POS, mobile commerce application and self-ordering Apple\u00ae iPad\u00ae-based kiosk. On May 20, 2015, our subsidiaries TOT Group Europe, Ltd. and TOT Group Russia LLC, entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets and liabilities that comprise PayOnline. PayOnline\u2019s business includes the operation of a protected payment processing system to accept bank card payments for goods and services. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this acquisition. Future acquisitions could divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business. In addition, integrating an acquired company, business or technology is risky and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Foreign acquisitions also involve unique risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. We may not accurately assess the value or prospects of acquisition candidates, and the anticipated benefits from our future or even past acquisitions may not materialize. In addition, future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, including our common stock, the incurrence of significant amounts of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could negatively affect our financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon certain key relationships. If any of our key relationships were to deteriorate, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success, particularly the success of our payment processing business, is dependent, in part, upon industry relationships of certain of our directors, including our director, Kenges Rakishev, and our Chief Executive Officer Oleg Firer. If we were to lose the services of Mr. Rakishev and/or Mr. Firer, or if the industry relationships of Mr. Firer on which we rely were to deteriorate, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. To our knowledge, neither Mr. Rakishev nor Mr. Firer currently has any plans to retire or leave us in the near future, and we are not aware of any material adverse developments in Mr. Firer\u2019s industry relationships. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on the lives of Mr. Rakishev and/or Mr. Firer or any other member of our management team.\nIf we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, competitors may create and market products and services similar to ours. In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent in part upon the proprietary nature of our technologies and software platforms. We generally rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent law to protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual properties. Although we attempt to protect our proprietary technologies through trade secrets, trademarks, patents and license and other agreements, these may be insufficient. In addition, if we license our software to non-U.S. countries, because of differences in foreign laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual properties may not receive the same degree of protection in non-U.S. countries as they would in the United States. We may not always be able to successfully protect or enforce our proprietary information and assets against competitors, which may materially adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently utilize existing technologies to develop products that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours, which also could materially adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, although we do not believe that our intellectual properties infringe the rights of others and while to date we have not been subject to such claims, we may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by other parties alleging that our technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. An adverse determination in any intellectual property claim could require us to pay damages and/or stop using our technologies and other material found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights and could prevent us from licensing our technologies to others. In order to avoid these restrictions, we may have to seek a license. Such a license may not be available on reasonable terms, could require us to pay significant license fees and may significantly increase our operating expenses. A license also may not be available to us at all. As a result, we may be required to use and/or develop non-infringing alternatives, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot obtain a license or develop alternatives for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our technologies and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, from time to time we may be engaged in disputes regarding the licensing of our intellectual property rights, including matters related to the terms of our licensing arrangements. These types of disputes can be asserted by our licensees or prospective licensees or by other third parties as part of negotiations with us or in private actions seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief or in regulatory actions. Requests for monetary and injunctive remedies asserted in claims like these could be material and could have a significant impact on our business prospects. Any disputes with our licensees, potential licensees or other third parties could materially adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe earn revenues and interest income, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we used two functional currencies - the Ukraine hryvnia and the Russian ruble - in addition to the U.S. dollar, and derived more than 32% of our total net revenues from operations outside the United States in Russia and CIS. Operations were ceased in the Ukraine in February 2015 and we have no further exposure to the Ukraine hryvnia after that date. Further, as of March 20, 2016, the foreign exchange rate for the Russian Ruble has deteriorated by approximately 13% as compared to the weekly rate at January 11, 2015. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate net revenues, interest income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect the amounts of our net revenues, interest income, operating expenses and the value of balance sheet items, including intercompany assets and obligations. Because we have operations in Russia, our exchange rate risk is highly sensitive to the prevailing value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Russian ruble, which exchange rates have fluctuated significantly in recent months as a result, in part, of the continuing instability in Ukraine and Syria as well as continued sanctions against Russia. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar against the Russian ruble, may materially adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretations, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and companies transmitting user information and payments via text message or other electronic means, many of which are still evolving and the interpretation of which are often uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and/or fines. The services of Digital Provider to mobile phone carriers also are subject to certain of the rules and policies of such carriers and ongoing contractual covenants with such carriers, the violation of which may result in penalties and/or fines and possible termination of Digital Provider\u2019s services. For additional information, see \u201cBusiness Description - Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.\nPoor perception of our brand, business or industry could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our reputation within our industries and with our clients and consumers. We may be the subject of unflattering reports in blogs, video blogs and the media about our business and our business model. Any damage to our reputation could harm our ability to obtain and retain contracts with mobile phone carriers, content providers, advertisers and other customers, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nOur business is subject to the risks of hurricanes, floods, fires and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from hurricanes, floods, fires, power losses, telecommunications outages, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. Our U.S. corporate offices are located in Miami, Florida, which is an area that is at high risk of hurricane and flood damage. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole. The servers that we use through various third party service providers are not located in Miami, Florida but may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Such service providers may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances, and our insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. As we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt our customers\u2019 respective businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our business prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we currently incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses not incurred by private companies. It may be time consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop, implement and maintain the additional internal controls, processes and reporting procedures required by federal statutes, SEC rules, other government regulations affecting public companies and/or stock exchange compliance requirements. We may need to hire additional financial reporting, internal auditing and other finance staff in order to develop, implement and maintain appropriate internal controls, processes and reporting procedures, which will increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are the subject of various legal proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe are involved in various litigation matters. We may, from time to time, also be involved in or be the subject of governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations. If we are unsuccessful in our defense in the litigation matters, or any other legal proceeding, we may be forced to pay damages or fines and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information about our legal proceedings, see \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Securities:\nKenges Rakishev, a director of the Company, owns a large portion of the Company\u2019s common stock. Future sales or distributions of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market by the Company or Mr. Rakishev could adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAt March, 2016, Kenges Rakishev, a director of the Company, owned approximately 18% of the Company\u2019s common stock. Sales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock by Mr. Rakishev in the public market, or the perception that these sales or distributions might occur, may cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline.\nIn addition, we may sell equity securities in the future to obtain funds for general corporate, working capital, acquisitions or other purposes. We may sell these securities at a discount to the then market price. Any future sales of equity securities will dilute the holdings of existing stockholders, possibly reducing the value of their investment.\nOur merchants may be unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable.\nWe are subject to the risk of our merchants being unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable. For example, we and our merchants acquiring alliances may be subject to contingent liability for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants. If we or the alliance is unable to collect this amount from the merchant because of the merchant\u2019s insolvency or other reasons, we or the alliance will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. We have an active program to manage our credit risk and often mitigate our risk by obtaining collateral. It is possible, however, that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others. Examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit, debit or prepaid card, card number, or other credentials to record a false sales transaction, processes an invalid card, or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud. It is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud would increase our chargeback liability or other liability. Increases in chargebacks or other liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations.\nFrom time to time, card associations and debit networks increase the organization and/or processing fees (known as interchange fees) that they charge. It is possible that competitive pressures will result in us absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin, and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements. Any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes.\nOur Common Stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, which could affect its market price and liquidity.\nWe are required to continually meet the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market (including a minimum bid price for our common stock of $1.00 per share) to maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market. On June 19, 2015, we received a deficiency letter from The NASDAQ Capital Market indicating that for 30 consecutive trading days our common stock had a closing bid price below the $1.00 per share minimum. In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rules, we were provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until December 16, 2015, to regain compliance with this requirement. On December 17, 2015, we received a letter from The NASDAQ Capital Market notifying us that the initial period of 180 calendar days previously provided to the Company to regain compliance with the requirement was extended for an additional 180 calendar day period, or until June 13, 2016. We can regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement if the bid price of our Common Stock closes at $1.00 per share or higher for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. If we do not regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement by June 13, 2016, The NASDAQ Capital Market will provide written notice that our securities are subject to delisting. At such time, we would be entitled to appeal the delisting determination to a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel. We have received Board and shareholder approval to facilitate a reverse stock split to increase the bid price of our common stock, if required. We cannot provide any assurance that our stock price will recover within the permitted grace period.\nAny delisting of our common stock from The NASDAQ Capital Market could adversely affect our ability to attract new investors, reduce the liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock, reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which our common stock trades and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders. In addition, delisting of our common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 12350, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "NETE"}
