{"cik": "1645469", "company": "Monopar Therapeutics", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. A prospective investor should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects and prospective investors could lose all or part of their investment. The risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not exhaustive; other significant risks may exist that are not identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but that might still materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations were any of such risks to occur.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a limited operating history, expect to incur significant operating losses, and have a high risk of never being profitable.\nWe commenced operations in December 2014 and have a limited operating history of less than five years. Therefore, there is limited historical financial or operational information upon which to evaluate our performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. Many if not most companies in our industry at our stage of development never become profitable and are acquired or go out of business before successfully developing any product that generates revenue from commercial sales or enables profitability.\nFrom inception in December 2014 through December 31, 2018, we have incurred losses of approximately $21.7 million, which includes $13.5 million of non-cash in-process research and development. We expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years for the clinical development of our current and future licensed or purchased product candidates.\nThe amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will become profitable are uncertain. We do not have any products that have generated any revenues from commercial sales, and do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the near future, if ever. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, successful completion of the development of our product candidates; obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA and international regulatory agencies; establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties; obtaining adequate reimbursement by third party payers; and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities. If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, financial condition, and results of operations are expected to be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a recently established public reporting company, we are subject to SEC reporting and other requirements, which will lead to increased operating costs in order to meet these requirements.\nIf we continue to incur operating losses and fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to advance our development programs, complete our clinical trials, or bring products to market, or may be forced to reduce or cease operations entirely. In addition, any capital obtained by us may be obtained on terms that are unfavorable to us, our investors, or both.\nDeveloping a new drug and conducting clinical trials and the regulatory review processes for one or more disease indications involves substantial costs. We have projected cash requirements for the near term based on a variety of assumptions, but some or all of such assumptions are likely to be incorrect and/or incomplete, possibly materially in an adverse direction. Our actual cash needs may deviate materially from those projections, changes in market conditions or other factors may increase our cash requirements, or we may not be successful even in raising the amount of cash we currently project will be required for the near term. We will need to raise additional capital in the future; the amount of additional capital needed will vary as a result of a number of factors, including without limitation the following:\n\u25cf\nreceiving less funding than we require;\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected costs to manufacture our active pharmaceutical ingredient and our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected costs for preclinical testing;\n\u25cf\nan increase in the number, size, duration, and/or complexity of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nslower than expected progress in developing Validive, MNPR-201, MNPR-101, or other product candidates, including without limitation, additional costs caused by program delays;\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected costs associated with attempting to obtain regulatory approvals, including without limitation additional costs caused by additional regulatory requirements or larger clinical trial requirements;\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected personnel, consulting or other costs, such as adding personnel or industry expert consultants or pursuing the licensing/acquisition of additional assets; and\n\u25cf\nhigher than expected costs to protect our intellectual property portfolio or otherwise pursue our intellectual property strategy.\nIf we attempt to raise additional financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional financing in sufficient quantities or at all. We may be unable to raise additional capital for reasons including, without limitation, our operational and/or financial performance, investor confidence in us and the biopharmaceutical industry, credit availability from banks and other financial institutions, the status of current projects, and our prospects for obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals. Potential investors\u2019 capital investments may have shifted to other opportunities with perceived greater returns and/or lower risk thereby reducing capital available to us, if available at all.\nIn addition, any additional financing might not be available, and even if available, may not be available on terms favorable to us or our then-existing investors. We may seek to raise funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaboration or licensing arrangements, mergers, acquisitions, sales of intellectual property, or other financing vehicles or arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or other securities, our then-existing investors will experience dilution. If we raise funds through debt financings or bank loans, we may become subject to restrictive covenants, our assets may be pledged as collateral for the debt, and the interests of our then-existing investors would be subordinated to the debt holders or banks. In addition, our use of and ability to exploit assets pledged as collateral for debt or loans may be restricted or forfeited. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish significant rights (including without limitation intellectual property rights) to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are not able to raise needed funding under acceptable terms or at all, then we will have to reduce expenses, including the possible options of curtailing operations, abandoning opportunities, licensing or selling off assets, reducing costs to a point where clinical development or other progress is impaired, or ceasing operations entirely.\nOur current cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to complete our Phase 3 clinical development of Validive, which requires that we raise additional funds. If we raise additional funds in the future to complete our Phase 3 clinical program for Validive, it may not be at favorable terms. If we are unable to raise enough funds in the future, we may have to discontinue or delay our operations.\nIn order to be commercially viable, we must successfully research, develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and distribute Validive and, if applicable, any current and future product candidates we may develop. The estimated required capital and time-frames necessary to achieve these developmental milestones as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as we may state from time to time is subject to inherent risks, many of which may be beyond our control. Clinical development of Validive will require significant funds. We cannot be certain the amount we raise in the near-term will be sufficient to fund our Validive Phase 3 clinical program to completion. When we raise additional funds in the future to be able to complete our Validive Phase 3 clinical program, it may be on terms that are unfavorable to us, and if we are unable to raise sufficient funds, we may have to discontinue or delay our operations.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our ability to raise funds, which may cause us to cease or delay our operations.\nFrom time to time, global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. Our financing strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make a debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, costlier, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy, financial performance and could require us to cease or delay our operations.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nWe do not have and may never have any approved products on the market. Our business is highly dependent upon receiving approvals from various U.S. and international governmental agencies and will be severely harmed if we are not granted approval to manufacture and sell our product candidates.\nIn order for us to commercialize any treatment for chemoradiation-induced SOM or for any other disease indication, we must obtain regulatory approvals of such treatment for that indication. Satisfying regulatory requirements is an expensive process that typically takes many years and involves compliance with requirements covering research and development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, and promotion of drugs for human use. To obtain necessary regulatory approvals, we must, among other requirements, complete clinical trials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that our products will prove to be safe and effective, that our clinical trials will demonstrate the necessary safety and effectiveness of our product candidates, or that we will succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any treatment we develop even if such safety and effectiveness are demonstrated.\nAny delays or difficulties we encounter in our clinical trials may delay or preclude regulatory approval from the FDA or from international regulatory organizations. Any delay or preclusion of regulatory approval would be expected to delay or preclude the commercialization of our products. Examples of delays or difficulties that we may encounter in our clinical trials include without limitation the following:\n\u25cf\nClinical trials may not yield sufficiently conclusive results for regulatory agencies to approve the use of our products.\n\u25cf\nOur products may fail to be more effective than current therapies, or to be effective at all.\n\u25cf\nWe may discover that our products have adverse side effects, which could cause our products to be delayed or precluded from receiving regulatory approval or otherwise expose us to significant commercial and legal risks.\n\u25cf\nIt may take longer than expected to determine whether or not a treatment is effective.\n\u25cf\nPatients involved in our clinical trials may suffer severe adverse side effects even up to death, whether as a result of treatment with our products, the withholding of such treatment, or other reasons (whether within or outside of our control).\n\u25cf\nWe may fail to be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials.\n\u25cf\nPatients enrolled in our clinical trials may not have the characteristics necessary to obtain regulatory approval for a particular indication or patient population.\n\u25cf\nWe may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of product to complete the clinical trials.\n\u25cf\nEven if we are successful in our clinical trials, any required governmental approvals may still not be obtained or, if obtained, may not be maintained.\n\u25cf\nIf approval for commercialization is granted, it is possible the authorized use will be more limited than is necessary for commercial success, or that approval may be conditioned on completion of further clinical trials or other activities, which will cause a substantial increase in costs and which we might not succeed in performing or completing.\n\u25cf\nIf granted, approval may be withdrawn or limited if problems with our products emerge or are suggested by the data arising from their use or if there is a change in law or regulation.\nAny success we may achieve at a given stage of our clinical trials does not guarantee that we will achieve success at any subsequent stage, including without limitation final FDA approval.\nWe may encounter delays or rejections in the regulatory approval process because of additional government regulation resulting from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in the policies of the FDA or other regulatory bodies during the period of product development, clinical trials, or regulatory review. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, or an injunction preventing certain activity, as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us. As a company, we have no experience in successfully obtaining regulatory approval for a product and thus may be poorly equipped to gauge, and may prove unable to manage, risks relating to obtaining such approval.\nOutside the U.S., our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving clearances from appropriate non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Non-U.S. regulatory approval typically includes all of the risks associated with FDA clearance discussed above as well as geopolitical uncertainties and the additional uncertainties and potential prejudices faced by U.S. pharmaceutical companies conducting business abroad. In certain cases, pricing restrictions and practices can make achieving even limited profitability very difficult.\nEven if we complete the clinical trials we discussed with the FDA, there is no guarantee that at the time of submission the FDA will accept our new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d).\nThe FDA provided helpful guidance on our proposed Validive adaptive design trial and confirmatory second trial, informing us it might be an acceptable pathway for NDA submission, but the FDA is not bound by the guidance they give, and can change their position in the future, even if a company gets a special protocol assessment (\u201cSPA\u201d) in place. Any future decision by the FDA will be driven largely by the data generated from the Validive clinical trials.\nAs a company, we have never completed a clinical trial and have limited experience in completing regulatory filings and any delays in regulatory filings could materially affect our financial condition.\nWhile members of our team have conducted numerous clinical trials at previous companies, and have launched and marketed innovative pharmaceutical products in the US and internationally, as a company, we have not yet completed any clinical trials of our product candidates, nor have we demonstrated the ability to obtain marketing approvals, manufacture product candidates at a commercial scale, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for the successful commercialization of a product. Consequently, we have no historical basis as a company by which one can evaluate or predict reliably our future success or viability.\nAdditionally, while our team has experience at prior companies with regulatory filings, as a company, we have limited experience with regulatory filings with agencies such as the FDA or EMA. Any delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates, and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such filings, including, without limitation, the FDA\u2019s issuance of a \u201crefuse to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information, could materially affect our financial condition.\nWe may seek fast track designation for one or more of our current and future product candidates, but we might not receive such designation, and even if we do, such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nOur lead product candidate, Validive, has been given fast track designation from the FDA. Fast track designation does not ensure that we will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. We may not experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process with fast track designation compared to conventional FDA procedures. Additionally, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation, for reasons such as it comes to believe a drug candidate no longer adequately addresses an unmet medical need. Fast track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures. If we seek fast track designation for other product candidates, we may not receive such a designation from the FDA.\nWe, or any future collaborators, may not be able to obtain and maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates in the U.S. and Europe.\nValidive has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of SOM in the EU. MNPR-201 has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in the U.S. We may seek additional orphan drug designations or regulatory incentives for our pipeline product candidates, for other indications or for future product candidates. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such designations.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be able to maintain orphan drug exclusivity for that drug. For example, orphan drug designation may be removed if the prevalence of an indication increases beyond the patient number limit required to maintain designation. Generally, if a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same product in the same indication for that time period. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Moreover, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care compared to our product.\nThe FDA may reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies, and similarly the EMA may reevaluate its policies and regulations. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA or EMA may change their orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA and/or EMA may make to their orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nIf serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may abandon or limit our development or commercialization of such product candidates.\nIf our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have unexpected characteristics, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.\nIf we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial with one of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidate will be harmed, and our ability to generate revenue from such product candidate will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nWith regard to our lead product candidate, Validive, unforeseen side effects from Validive could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after Validive has been marketed. This could cause regulatory approvals for, or market acceptance of, Validive harder and costlier to obtain.\nTo date, no difference in the frequency of serious adverse events (\u201cSAEs\u201d) has been observed in patients treated with Validive compared to placebo. In the Phase 2 clinical trial, two patients in the placebo group and 2 patients in the Validive 50 \u00b5g group experienced SAEs that were assessed as treatment related. No patients in the Validive treated cohorts were discontinued due to study drug. Clonidine, the active ingredient of Validive, has been used for over 50 years as an orally swallowed systemic treatment for high blood pressure. Validive administration leads to very low, but still detectable exposure of clonidine outside the oral cavity. Thus, there is some risk that patients may experience side effects due to this systemic exposure, which could include a reduction in blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, drowsiness or dry mouth.\nThe results of our planned or any future clinical trials may show that the side effects of Validive are unacceptable or intolerable, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA or EMA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA or EMA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings.\nIf Validive receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by the use of Validive:\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the prouct, which would force us to remove Validive from the market;\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication, or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to change instructions regarding the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u25cf\nwe may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product;\n\u25cf\nsales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u25cf\nwe may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u25cf\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our potential future collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of Validive and/or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of Validive.\nOur Phase 3 development program for Validive entails significant risk.\nThe Phase 3 development program for Validive has been designed based on an analysis of the 64 oropharyngeal cancer (\u201cOPC\u201d) patients included in the Phase 2 trial (n= 24 in the placebo group, n= 21 Validive 50 \u00b5g group, and n= 19 Validive 100 \u00b5g group). While a dose response was observed in the Validive treated OPC cohorts compared to placebo across multiple clinically meaningful endpoints, the ability to establish statistical significance was limited by the relatively small sample size. This increases the risk of the Phase 3 trials. Given the large unmet medical need for the prevention of radiotherapy-induced SOM in OPC patients, we have decided to pursue an adaptive design Phase 3 clinical development strategy in an effort to mitigate this risk. Our adaptive design approach will allow us to confirm or reject our hypothesis based off the Phase 2 data that the optimal patient population for Validive is likely either all OPC patients or HPV+ OPC patients, and then run a confirmatory second trial should it be warranted.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects to our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented, which could materially affect our financial condition.\nIdentifying, screening and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success, and we may not be able to identify, recruit, enroll and dose a sufficient number of patients with the required or desired characteristics to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. The timing of our clinical trials depends on our ability to recruit patients to participate as well as to subsequently dose these patients and complete required follow-up periods. In particular, because our planned clinical trials of Validive and MNPR-201 are focused on indications with relatively small patient populations, our ability to enroll eligible patients may be limited or may result in slower enrollment than we anticipate.\nIn addition, we may experience enrollment delays related to increased or unforeseen regulatory, legal and logistical requirements at certain clinical trial sites. These delays could be caused by reviews by regulatory authorities and contractual discussions with individual clinical trial sites. Any delays in enrolling and/or dosing patients in our planned clinical trials could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product candidates, delays in testing the effectiveness of our product candidates or in termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nPatient enrollment may be affected if our competitors have ongoing clinical trials with products for the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials instead enroll in our competitors\u2019 clinical trials. Patient enrollment may also be affected by other factors, including:\n\u25cf\ncoordination with clinical research organizations to enroll and administer the clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ncoordination and recruitment of collaborators and investigators at individual sites;\n\u25cf\nsize of the patient population and process for identifying patients;\n\u25cf\ndesign of the clinical trial protocol;\n\u25cf\neligibility and exclusion criteria;\n\u25cf\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidates under study;\n\u25cf\navailability of competing commercially available therapies and other competing products\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ntime of year in which the trials are initiated or conducted;\n\u25cf\nseverity of the diseases under investigation;\n\u25cf\nability to obtain and maintain subject consents;\n\u25cf\nability to enroll and treat patients in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nrisk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion of the trials;\n\u25cf\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u25cf\nability to monitor subjects adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u25cf\npatient referral practices of physicians.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which could materially affect our financial condition.\nIf we or our licensees, development collaborators, or suppliers are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or at defined quality specifications, or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for the manufacturing facility, we may be unable to develop and/or meet demand for our products and lose time to market and potential revenues.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates. We currently plan to contract with third parties to manufacture Validive, MNPR-201, and MNPR-101. We have an agreement in place with a manufacturer for Validive and MNPR-101. We are in negotiations with manufacturers for MNPR-201.\nIn the future we may become unable, for various reasons, to rely on our sources for the manufacture of our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, at some future date, for commercial distribution. We may not be successful in identifying additional or replacement third-party manufacturers, or in negotiating acceptable terms with any we do identify. We may face competition for access to these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and may be subject to manufacturing delays if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than they give to us. Even if we are able to identify an additional or replacement third-party manufacturer, the delays and costs associated with establishing and maintaining a relationship with such manufacturer may have a material adverse effect on us.\nBefore we can begin to commercially manufacture Validive, MNPR-201, MNPR-101, or any other product candidate, we must obtain regulatory approval of the manufacturing facility and process. Manufacturing of drugs for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, commonly known as \u201ccGMP.\u201d The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to ensure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We, or our contracted manufacturing facility, must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection may significantly delay or prevent FDA approval of our products. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products and will lose time to market and potential revenues.\nIt is uncertain whether product liability insurance will be adequate to address product liability claims, or that insurance against such claims will be affordable or available on acceptable terms in the future.\nClinical research involves the testing of new drugs on human volunteers pursuant to a clinical trial protocol. Such testing involves a risk of liability for personal injury to or death of patients due to, among other causes, adverse side effects, improper administration of the new drug, or improper volunteer behavior. Claims may arise from patients, clinical trial volunteers, consumers, physicians, hospitals, companies, institutions, researchers, or others using, selling, or buying our products, as well as from governmental bodies. In addition, product liability and related risks are likely to increase over time, in particular upon the commercialization or marketing of any products by us or parties with which we enter into development, marketing, or distribution collaborations. Although we are contracting for general liability insurance in connection with our ongoing business, there can be no assurance that the amount and scope of such insurance coverage will be appropriate and sufficient in the event any claims arise, that we will be able to secure additional coverage should we attempt to do so, or that our insurers would not contest or refuse any attempt by us to collect on such insurance policies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that suitable product liability insurance (at the clinical stage and/or commercial stage) will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or at all, or that, if obtained, the insurance coverage will be appropriate and sufficient to cover any potential claims or liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nCorporate, non-profit, and academic collaborators may take actions (including lack of effective actions) to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our products.\nOur operating and financial strategy for the development, clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of product candidates is heavily dependent on us entering into collaborations with corporations, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in establishing such collaborations. Future collaborations may be terminable at the sole discretion of the collaborator. The activities of any collaborator will not be within our direct control and may not be in our power to influence. There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all; that we will derive any revenue, profits, or benefit from such collaborations; or that any collaborator will not compete with us. If any collaboration is not pursued, we may require substantially greater capital to undertake development and commercialization of our proposed products, and may not be able to develop and commercialize such products effectively, if at all. In addition, a lack of development and commercialization collaborations may lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets. Furthermore, future collaborators may act deliberately or inadvertently in ways detrimental to our interests.\nThe termination of third-party licenses could adversely affect our rights to important compounds or technologies.\nWe have exercised our option to license Validive; as such, Onxeo has the ability to terminate the license if we breach our obligations under the license agreement. A termination of the license agreement might force us to cease developing and/or selling Validive, if it gets to market. We rely on certain rights to MNPR-101 that we have secured through a non-exclusive license agreement with XOMA. XOMA, as licensor, has the ability to terminate the license if we breach our obligations under the license agreement and do not remedy any such breach within a set time after receiving written notice of such breach from XOMA. A termination of the license agreement might force us to cease developing and/or selling MNPR-101, if it gets to market.\nData provided by collaborators and other parties upon which we rely have not been independently verified and could turn out to be inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, clinical trials, and business. We do not independently verify or audit all of such data (including possibly material portions thereof). As a result, such data may be inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete.\nIn certain cases, we may need to rely on a single supplier for a particular manufacturing material or service, and any interruption in or termination of service by such supplier could delay or disrupt the commercialization of our products.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the materials used to manufacture our compounds. Some of these materials may at times only be available from one supplier. Any interruption in or termination of service by such single source suppliers could result in a delay or disruption in manufacturing until we locate an alternative source of supply. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in locating an alternative source of supply or in negotiating acceptable terms with such prospective supplier.\nOur Validive manufacturer is in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), and it is unknown how they will be impacted by Brexit; however, if they are negatively impacted, this could increase our manufacturing costs and adversely impact our financial condition.\nThe UK\u2019s referendum to leave the EU or \u201cBrexit,\u201d has caused and may continue to cause disruptions to capital and currency markets worldwide. The full impact of the Brexit decision, however, remains uncertain. A process of negotiation will determine the future terms of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. During this period of negotiation, our Validive manufacturer may be negatively affected by interest rate, exchange rate and other market and economic volatility, as well as regulatory and political uncertainty. The tax consequences of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU are uncertain as well. If Brexit has a detrimental effect on our Validive manufacture, it could, in turn, adversely impact our manufacturing costs and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our non-clinical studies and our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our current product candidates or any future products, on a timely basis or at all, and our financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct non-clinical studies and clinical trials. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories, collaborative partners and other third parties, such as contract research organizations or clinical research organizations, to conduct non-clinical studies and clinical trials on our product candidates. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our non-clinical studies and clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these studies and trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs.\nAlthough we rely on third parties to conduct our non-clinical studies and clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our non-clinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, including some regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (\u201cGCPs\u201d), for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials.\nIn addition, the execution of non-clinical studies and clinical trials, and the subsequent compilation and analyses of the data produced, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. Moreover, these third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Under certain circumstances, these third parties may be able to terminate their agreements with us upon short notice. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we may not be able to obtain, on a timely basis or at all, regulatory approval for or to commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials, and as a result, our financial condition will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe have no experience as a company in commercializing any product. If we fail to obtain commercial expertise, upon product approval by regulatory agencies, our product launch and revenues could be delayed.\nAs a company, we have never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, any product. Accordingly, we have not yet begun to build out any sales or marketing capabilities. If we are unable to establish effective sales and marketing capabilities, or if we are unable to enter into agreements with third parties to commercialize our product candidates on favorable terms or on any reasonable terms at all, we may not be able to effectively generate product revenues once our product candidates are approved for marketing. If we fail to obtain commercial expertise, upon drug approval, our product launch and subsequent revenues could be delayed and /or fail to reach their commercial potential.\nOur product development efforts are at an early stage. We have not yet undertaken any marketing efforts, and there can be no assurance that future anticipated market testing and analyses will validate our marketing strategy. We may need to modify the products, or we may not be successful in either developing or marketing those products.\nAs a company, we have not completed the development or clinical trials of any product candidates and, accordingly, have not yet begun to market or generate revenue from the commercialization of any products. Obtaining approvals of these product candidates will require substantial additional research and development as well as costly clinical trials. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete development of our product candidates or successfully market them. We may encounter problems and delays relating to research and development, regulatory approval, intellectual property rights of product candidates, or other factors. There can be no assurance that our development programs will be successful, that our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective in or after clinical trials, that the necessary regulatory approvals for any product candidates will be obtained, or, even if obtained, will be as broad as sought or will be maintained for any period thereafter, that patents will issue on our patent applications, that any intellectual property protections we secure will be adequate, or that our collaboration arrangements will not diminish the value of our intellectual property through licensing or other arrangements. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any product we might market will be received favorably by customers (whether physicians, payers, patients, or all three), adequately reimbursed by third party payers, or that competitive products will not perform better and/or be marketed more successfully. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any future market testing and analyses will validate our marketing strategies. We may need to seek to modify the product labels through additional studies in order to be able to market them successfully to reach their commercial potential.\nIf we are unable to establish relationships with licensees or collaborators to carry out sales, marketing, and distribution functions or to create effective marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities, we will be unable to market our products successfully.\nOur business strategy may include out-licensing product candidates to or collaborating with larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully be able to establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with any third party, that such relationships, if established, will be successful, or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for any products we might develop. To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues per unit sold are expected to be lower than if we marketed, sold, and distributed our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties.\nIf we are unable to establish such third-party marketing and sales relationships, or choose not to do so, we would have to establish in-house marketing and sales capabilities. We have no experience in marketing or selling oncology pharmaceutical products, and currently have no marketing, sales, or distribution infrastructure and no experience developing or managing such infrastructure for an oncology related product. To market any products directly, we would have to establish a marketing, sales, and distribution force that has technical expertise and could support a distribution capability. Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry for technically proficient marketing, sales, and distribution personnel is intense and attracting and retaining such personnel may significantly increase our costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities or that these capabilities will be sufficient to meet our needs.\nCommercial success of our product candidates will depend on the acceptance of these products by physicians, payers, and patients.\nAny product candidate that we may develop may not gain market acceptance among physicians and patients. Market acceptance of and demand for any product that we may develop will depend on many factors, including without limitation:\nComparative superiority of the effectiveness and safety in the treatment of the disease indication compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nLess prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\nPotential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nCost effectiveness;\n\u25cf\nConvenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nSufficient third-party coverage and/or reimbursement;\n\u25cf\nStrength of sales, marketing and distribution support; and\n\u25cf\nOur ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy.\nIf any product candidate developed by us receives regulatory approval but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance by physicians, payers, and patients, we may generate insufficient, little, or no product revenue and may not become profitable.\nOur products may not be accepted for reimbursement or properly reimbursed by third-party payers.\nThe successful commercialization of any products we might develop will depend substantially on whether the costs of our products and related treatments are reimbursed at acceptable levels by government authorities, private healthcare insurers, and other third-party payers, such as health maintenance organizations. Reimbursement rates may vary, depending upon the third-party payer, the type of insurance plan, and other similar or dissimilar factors. If our products do not achieve adequate reimbursement, then the number of physician prescriptions of our products may not be sufficient to make our products profitable.\nComparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits of a competitor\u2019s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nAdequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in the product development of that product. In addition, in the U.S. there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payers and by government agencies. To the extent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payers may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products or reimburse our products at a lower rate.\nThe effects of economic and political pressure to lower pharmaceutical prices are a major threat to the economic viability of new research-based pharmaceutical products, and any development along these lines could materially and adversely affect our prospects.\nEmphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nAny development along these lines could materially and adversely affect our prospects. We are unable to predict what legislative or regulatory changes relating to the healthcare industry, including without limitation any changes affecting governmental and/or private or third-party coverage and reimbursement, may be enacted in the future, or what effect such legislative or regulatory changes would have on our business.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws; these laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. Fraud and abuse laws are expected to increase in breadth and in detail, which will likely increase our operating costs and the complexity of our programs to insure compliance with such enhanced laws.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the U.S., our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, distributors, or other business partners, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes which may increase our operating costs. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct business.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state fraud and abuse laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to criminal actions and significant civil monetary penalties, which would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates are ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.\nNegotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.\nGovernment payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval; however, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we and our third-party licensors do not obtain and preserve protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our (and our licensors\u2019) development efforts to develop competing drugs.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for any products and other technologies we might develop, and successfully defending any patents we obtain against third-party challenges. We have licensed all intellectual property related to Validive from Onxeo S.A., a French public company. See \u201cBusiness - Partnerships, Licensing and Acquisition\u201d. The assignment and transfer of the MNPR-201 (GPX-150) patent portfolio from TacticGem, LLC (\u201cTacticGem\u201d) to us has been completed. We filed and have been granted in the U.S. and various countries around the world patents for antibodies that target uPAR for our MNPR-101 program. We have also been granted in the U.S. and various countries around the world patents to a specific sequence of amino acids on uPAR, to which our MNPR-101 antibody binds. We are currently prosecuting this patent in other countries around the world to further protect MNPR-101. The patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining and defending patents. See \u201cItem I Business - Intellectual Property Portfolio and Exclusivity\u201d. These risks and uncertainties include without limitation the following:\n\u25cf\nPatents that may be issued or licensed may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; or may not provide any competitive advantage for other reasons.\n\u25cf\nOur licensors may terminate or breach our existing or future license agreements, thereby reducing or preventing our ability to exclude competition; termination of such license agreements may also subject us to risk of patent infringement of patents to which we no longer have a license.\n\u25cf\nOur competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us and have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the U.S. or in international markets.\n\u25cf\nAs a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns, there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of domestic and international patent protection for cancer treatments that prove successful.\n\u25cf\nCountries other than the U.S. may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by the U.S. courts; therefore, non-U.S. competitors could exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products. In some countries, the legal compliance with pharmaceutical patents, patent applications and other intellectual property regulations is very weak or actively evaded in some cases with government aid.\nIn addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting their scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nIf we permit our patents to lapse or expire, we will not be protected and will have less of a competitive advantage. The value of our products may be greatly reduced if this occurs. Our patents expire at different times and are subject to the laws of multiple countries. Some of our patents are currently near expiration and we may pursue patent term extensions for these where appropriate. See \u201cItem I Business - Intellectual Property Portfolio and Exclusivity\u201d.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how. While we take measures to protect this information by entering into confidentiality and invention agreements with our consultants and collaborators, we cannot provide any assurances that these agreements will be fully enforceable and will not be breached, that we will be able to protect ourselves from the harmful effects of disclosure if they are not fully enforceable or are breached, that any remedy for a breach will adequately compensate us, that these agreements will achieve their intended aims, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. If any of these events for which we cannot provide assurances occurs, or we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nThe patent protection we obtain and preserve for our product candidates may not be sufficient enough to provide us with any competitive advantage.\nWe may be subject to competition despite the existence of intellectual property we license or own. We can give no assurances that our intellectual property claims will be sufficient to prevent third parties from designing around patents we own or license and developing and commercializing competitive products. The existence of competitive products that avoid our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, limitations, or perceived limitations, in our intellectual property may limit the interest of third parties to partner, collaborate or otherwise transact with us, if third parties perceive a higher than acceptable risk to commercialization of our products or future products. When looking at our Validive patents\u2019 ability to block competition, the protection offered by our patents may be, to some extent, more limited than the protection provided by patents claiming the composition of matter of entirely new chemical structures previously unknown. If a competitor were able to successfully design around any method of use and formulation patents we may have now or in the future, our business and competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, including generic medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to ours.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of any FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. Only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from approval and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for the applicable product candidate will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case, and our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nIntellectual property disputes could require us to spend time and money to address such disputes and could limit our intellectual property rights.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation and USPTO post-grant proceedings to gain a competitive advantage. We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of patents and pending applications of our competitors, or additional interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine the priority and patentability of inventions. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others. An adverse determination in litigation or USPTO post-grant and interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets. Even if a given patent or intellectual property dispute were settled through licensing or similar arrangements, our costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include the payment by us of large fixed payments and ongoing royalties. Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all. Even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, the costs of litigation may prevent us from pursuing these claims or defenses and/or may require extensive financial and personnel resources to pursue these claims or defenses. In addition, it is possible there may be defects of form in our current and future patents that could result in our inability to defend the intended claims. Intellectual property disputes arising from the aforementioned factors, or other factors, may materially harm our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market Validive or any future products. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the U.S. and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for our products and technology.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them. Despite these efforts, these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the U.S., including in foreign jurisdictions, are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nChanges to the patent law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the U.S. has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, as well as other jurisdictions around the world, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nAs a recently established entity, we have a limited operating history.\nAs of February 15, 2019, we have engaged exclusively in acquiring pharmaceutical product candidates, licensing rights to product candidates and entering into collaboration agreements with respect to key services or technologies for our drug product development, and have not completed any clinical trials, received any governmental approvals, brought any product to market, manufactured products in clinical or commercial quantities or sold any pharmaceutical products. As a company we have limited experience in negotiating, establishing, and maintaining strategic relationships, conducting clinical trials, and managing the regulatory approval process, all of which will be necessary if we are to be successful. Our lack of experience in these critical areas makes it difficult for a prospective investor to evaluate our abilities and increases the risk that we will fail to successfully execute our strategies.\nFurthermore, if our business grows rapidly, our operational, managerial, legal, and financial resources will be strained. Our development will require continued improvement and expansion of our management team and our operational, managerial, legal, and financial systems and controls.\nIn the normal course of business, we have evaluated and expect to evaluate potential acquisitions and/or licenses of patents, compounds, and technologies that our management believes could complement or expand our business. We have limited history of conducting acquisitions and negotiating and acquiring licenses. In the event that we identify an acquisition or license candidate we find attractive, there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating an agreement to acquire or license, or in financing or profitably exploiting, such patents, compounds, or technologies. Furthermore, such an acquisition or license could divert management time and resources away from other activities that would further our current business development.\nIf we lose key management leadership, and/or scientific personnel, and if we cannot recruit qualified employees, managers, directors, officers, or other significant personnel, we may experience program delays and increases in compensation costs, and our business may be materially disrupted.\nOur future success is highly dependent on the continued service of principal members of our management, leadership, and scientific personnel, who are able to terminate their employment with us at any time and may be able to compete with us. The loss of any of our key management, leadership, or scientific personnel including, in particular, Christopher M. Starr, our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors (referred to as the \u201cBoard\u201d or the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d), Chandler D. Robinson, our President and CEO, and Andrew P. Mazar, our Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, could materially disrupt our business and materially delay or prevent the successful product development and commercialization of our product candidates. We have employment agreements with Dr. Robinson and Dr. Mazar which have no term but are for at-will employment, meaning the executives have the ability to terminate their employment at any time. We do not have an employment agreement with Dr. Starr.\nOur future success will also depend on our continuing ability to identify, hire, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of the organization. Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry for scientifically and technically qualified personnel is intense, and we may be unsuccessful in identifying, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. Our continued requirement to identify, hire, and retain highly competent personnel may cause our compensation costs to increase materially.\nDespite ongoing compliance training and periodic education, our employees and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could result in delays or terminations of our development programs and adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we regularly train our employees on compliance and we are aware of no misconduct or improper activities to date, we are exposed to the risk of employee or consultant fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by our employees or consultants could include intentional failures to: comply with FDA regulations: provide accurate information to the FDA; comply with manufacturing standards; comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee and consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Such actions could adversely affect our business including delaying or terminating one or more of our development programs.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we also intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis). If we do take advantage of these exemptions, the information that we provide stockholders will be different than what is available with respect to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our status as an emerging growth company, if and when our stock becomes publicly traded, there may be less liquidity for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of a public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nCompetition and technological change may make our product candidates less competitive or obsolete.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid technological change. We have many potential competitors, including major drug and chemical companies, specialized biopharmaceutical firms, universities and other research institutions. These companies, firms, and other institutions may develop products that are more effective than our product candidates or that would make our product candidates less competitive or obsolete. Many of these companies, firms, and other institutions have greater financial resources than us and may be better able to withstand and respond to adverse market conditions within the biopharmaceutical industry, including without limitation the lengthy regulatory approval process for product candidates.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our expertise in small molecules and biologics, and rare disease clinical development, along with a strong intellectual property portfolio, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our drug development programs from companies that target SOM, are developing doxorubicin analogs/replacement, and are targeting uPAR. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academia. Accordingly, our competitors may have more resources and be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, we will have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases, and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u25cf\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management's time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u25cf\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nhigher-than-expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u25cf\nwrite-downs of assets, goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u25cf\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u25cf\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u25cf\ninability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial costs to defend them and address any damages awarded, and demand for our products could be reduced as a result of such lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products is subject to an inherent risk of product liability claims, including a possibility in some states for product liability claims being made based on generic copies of our drugs. Since we currently are not sponsoring any clinical trials, we do not have product liability insurance coverage, but plan to obtain appropriate coverage when we enroll patients in a Validive or other clinical trial, assuming the coverage is available at a commercially reasonable cost, if available at all. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial volunteers;\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for our products when approved;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our reputation and significant, adverse media attention; and\n\u25cf\npotentially significant litigation costs, including without limitation, any damages awarded to the plaintiffs if we lose or settle claim\nOur business and operations are vulnerable to computer system failures, cyber-attacks or deficiencies in our cyber-security, which could increase our expenses, divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from: computer viruses; malware; natural disasters; terrorism; war; telecommunication and electrical failures; cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet; attachments to emails; persons inside our organization; or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability, and damage to our reputation, and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. We could be forced to expend significant resources in response to a cyber security breach, including repairing system damage, increasing cyber security protection costs by deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, paying regulatory fines and resolving legal claims and regulatory actions, all of which would increase our expenses, divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe use hazardous materials, including radioactive materials, in our business, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage, or disposal of these materials could materially harm our business.\nOur business involves the use of a broad range of hazardous chemicals and materials, including radioactive materials. Environmental laws impose stringent civil and criminal penalties for improper handling, disposal, and storage of these materials. In addition, in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials, we could be subject to civil damages due to personal injury or property damage caused by the release or exposure. A failure to comply with environmental laws could result in fines and the revocation of environmental permits, which could prevent us from conducting our business.\nWe have limited the liability of and indemnified our directors and officers.\nAlthough our directors and officers are accountable to us and must exercise good faith, good business judgement, and integrity in handling our affairs, our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), provides that our directors will be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. As a result, our stockholders may have fewer rights against our directors than they would have absent such provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, and a stockholder\u2019s ability to seek and recover damages for a breach of fiduciary duties may be reduced or restricted. Delaware law allows indemnification of members of our Board (each a \u201cMember\u201d), if such Board Member (a) has acted in good faith, in a manner the Board Member reasonably believes to be in or not opposed to our best interests, and (b) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, if the Board Member had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.\nPursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, each director and (to the extent approved by our Board) each of our officers who is made a party to a legal proceeding because he or she is or was a Board Member or officer, is indemnified by us from and against any and all liability, except that we may not indemnify a Board Member or officer: (a) for any liability incurred in a proceeding in which such person is adjudged liable to Monopar or is subjected to injunctive relief in favor of Monopar; (b) for acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, fraud or gross negligence; (c) for unlawful distributions; (d) for any transaction for which such Board Member or officer received a personal benefit or as otherwise prohibited by or as may be disallowed under Delaware law; or (e) with respect to any dispute or proceeding between us and such Board Member or officer unless such indemnification has been approved by a disinterested majority of Board Members or by a majority in interest of disinterested stockholders. We are required to pay or reimburse attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of a Board Member seeking indemnification as they are incurred, provided the director executes an agreement to repay the amount to be paid or reimbursed if there is a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\nFuture legislation or executive or private sector actions may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our products and affect the prices obtained for such products.\nThere have been several attempts made to repeal or modify the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d), and modification and partial or complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act in the future is possible. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law - one of its provisions repealed what is known as the individual mandate under PPACA, which may have the effect of negating PPACA. Healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria resulting in lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved.\nThe increasing cost of healthcare as a percentage of GDP and the increasing deferred liabilities behind most governmental healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) continue to be an economic challenge which threatens the overall economic health of the U.S. High cost healthcare products and therapies that are early in their life cycle are attractive targets for parties that believe that the cost of healthcare must be better controlled and significantly reduced. Pharmaceutical prices and healthcare reform have been debated and acted upon by legislators for many years. Future legislation or executive or private sector actions related to healthcare reform could materially and adversely affect our business by reducing our ability to generate revenue at prices sufficient to reward for the risks and costs of pharmaceutical development, to raise capital, and to market our products.\nThere is no assurance that federal or state healthcare reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform and third party payers will affect the pharmaceutical industry in general and our business in particular.\nLegislative actions, as well as various governmental policies and political actions can impact the FDA posing a risk to the successful development of new pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and our business may be negatively impacted.\nExecutive Orders and policy statements issued by President Trump, as well as legislative actions have increased the uncertainty regarding the FDA\u2019s interpretation and implementation of requirements under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d). Some of these actions may also negatively affect the FDA\u2019s exercise of regulatory oversight and ability to timely review and approve industry submissions and applications in connection with the drug development and approval processes. For example, due to the absence of a fiscal year 2019 appropriation or continuing resolution for the FDA, beginning on December 22, 2018 and continuing for a 35-day period, the FDA\u2019s operations were limited to those permitted by law. These activities were limited to such activities necessary to address imminent threats to the safety of human life and activities funded by carryover user fee funds. During this period, the FDA did not have legal authority to accept user fees assessed for fiscal year 2019 until a fiscal year 2019 appropriation or a continuting resolution was enactedAn under-resourced FDA could result in increasing delays in the FDA\u2019s responsiveness or in its ability to review applications, issue regulations or guidance, or implement or enforce regulatory requirements in a timely fashion or at all. If executive or legislative actions impose restrictions on the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities over human drugs and biologics in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nEffective collaboration with the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (\u201cCDER\u201d) for the approval of drug candidates is a highly demanding process which can result in increased time and expense to gain approvals.\nOur lead drug development program, Validive, will be reviewed by CDER. Efficient and professional collaboration with the FDA\u2019s CDER is essential for the timely clinical testing, test evaluations, analysis and approval of our drug candidates in the CDER is arguably the most qualified organization for the review and approval and continued monitoring of prescription pharmaceuticals. Financial resources available to CDER have increased every year from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2018 and are projected to increase in 2019. At the program level, which combines budget authority and industry user fees, the total fiscal year 2019 President\u2019s Budget is approximately $1,853 million and is an increase of approximately $198 million. CDER portion of the budget is approximately $1,651 million. The sources of the Budget funding is 30% from budget authority and 70% from industry user fees. Industry user fees have been extended to 2022. CDER has an outstanding record of drug approvals and substantial funds to operate a highly professional organization, but is also very demanding as to the quality of clinical research and applications for marketing approvals for drug candidates.\nOur Company has in-house expertise and experience in the management of drug approvals. Qualified consultants and drug research organizations are also available to aid the drug approvals, however, there is a meaningful risk that discussions and interactions inherent in the drug approval process and future developments or new improvements will result in delays, added expenses and new scientific/medical requirements which will cause adverse financial results and will likely impact the price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nFuture tax reform measures may negatively impact our financial position.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by tax reform measures. If tax reform measures are passed, there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive favorable tax treatment related to our patents. For example, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, treatment of proceeds from the sale of \u201cself-created\u201d patents as ordinary income, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of orphan drugs from 50% to 25%). Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock. It is difficult to predict what future tax reform measures, if any, could be implemented and the extent to which they will impact our accounting practices and our business.\nOur anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures over the next year are based upon our management\u2019s estimates of possible future events. Actual amounts and the cost of new conditions could differ materially from those estimated by our management.\nDevelopment of pharmaceuticals and cancer drugs is extremely risky and unpredictable. We have estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures over the next year based on certain assumptions. Any change in the assumptions could and will cause the actual results to vary substantially from the anticipated expenses and expenditures and could result in material differences in actual versus forecasted expenses or expenditures. Furthermore, all of the factors are subject to the effect of unforeseeable future events. The estimates of capital expenditures and operating expenses represent forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risk factors set forth under this \"Risk Factors\" section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In view of the foregoing, investors should not rely on these estimates in making a decision to invest in us.\nThe financial and operational projections that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.\nThe projections that we provide herein or our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, the cost and timing of our Phase 3 clinical trials, clinical and regulatory timelines, production and supply matters, commercial launch dates, and other financial or operational matters) reflect numerous assumptions made by our management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There may be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as an indication that we consider the projections to be a guaranteed prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. See \u201cSpecial Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nExisting and new investors will experience dilution as a result of future sales or issuances of our common stock and future option exercises under our stock option plan.\nOur Board Members, employees, and certain of our consultants have been and will be issued equity and/or granted options that vest with the passage of time. Up to a total of 1,600,000 shares of our common stock may be issued as stock options or restricted stock under the Amended and Restated Monopar Therapeutics Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, and stock options for the purchase of up to 1,105,896 shares of our common stock have already been granted and are outstanding as of February 26, 2019. See \u201cStock Option Plan\u201d. The issuance of such equity and/or the exercise of such options will dilute both our existing and our new investors. As of February 26, 2019, no stock options have been exercised.\nOur existing and our new investors will likely also experience substantial dilution resulting from the issuance by us of equity securities in connection with certain transactions, including without limitation, future offering of shares, intellectual property licensing, acquisition, or commercialization arrangements.\nHolders of the shares of our common stock will have no control of our operations or of decisions on major transactions.\nOur business and affairs are managed by or under the direction of our Board. Our Stockholders are entitled to vote only on actions that require a Stockholder vote under federal or state law. Stockholder approval requires the consent and approval of holders of a majority or more of our outstanding stock. Shares of stock do not have cumulative voting rights and therefore, holders of a majority of the shares of our outstanding stock will be able to elect all Board Members. TacticGem owns 7,166,667 shares of common stock (77.1%). The limited liability company agreement of TacticGem provides that the manager will vote its shares of Monopar to elect to the Board of Directors those persons nominated by Tactic Pharma plus one person nominated by Gem Pharmaceuticals, LLC (\u201cGem\u201d). Additionally, other than in the elections of directors the limited liability company agreement requires TacticGem to pass through votes to its members in proportion to their membership percentages in TacticGem. As a result, Tactic Pharma, our initial investor, holds an approximately 46% beneficial interest in us and together with Gem\u2019s beneficial ownership of approximately 33%, the two entities control a majority of our stock and will be able to elect all Board Members and control our affairs. Some of our Board Members and executive officers own and control Tactic Pharma. Although no single person has a controlling interest in Tactic Pharma, acting together, they are able to control Tactic Pharma and a large voting block of our common stock and elect over a majority of our Board of Directors. See \u201cPrincipal Stockholders\u201d.\nThere has been no prior public market for our common stock, if our stock becomes publicly tradable in the future, the future stock price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and limited trading volume could adversely affect your ability to resell your shares.\nThere has been no public market for our common stock up to and including the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If our stock becomes publicly tradable in the future, the future stock price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and limited trading volume could adversely affect your ability to resell your shares. An active or liquid market in our common stock may not develop or, if it does develop, it may not be sustainable.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile, and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nannouncements concerning the progress and success of our clinical trials, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates, including any requests we receive from the FDA for additional studies or data that result in delays in obtaining regulatory approval or launching our product candidates, if approved;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors or the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning product development results or intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf\nlitigation or public concern about the safety of our potential products;\n\u25cf\nactual fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, and concerns by investors that such fluctuations may occur in the future;\n\u25cf\ndeviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts or other analyst comments;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nhealthcare reform legislation, including measures directed at controlling the pricing of pharmaceutical products, and third-party coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning current or future strategic collaborations; and\n\u25cf\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities.\nIf our stock becomes publicly tradable in the future, we may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our stock to decline if our stock becomes publicly tradable in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a significant decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf our stock becomes publicly tradable in the future, substantial amounts of our outstanding shares may be sold into the market, when lock-up or market standoff periods end. If there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nIf our stock becomes publicly tradable in the future, the price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or if there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale and the market perceives that sales will occur. The overwhelming majority of all of our outstanding shares of common stock may be restricted from resale as a result of market stand-off and \u201clock-up\u201d agreements. Shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates would be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), and various vesting agreements.\nCertain of our stockholders have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders, subject to market standoff and lockup agreements. We also would likely intend to register shares of common stock that we have issued and may issue under our employee equity incentive plans. Once we register these shares, they would be able to be sold freely in the public market upon issuance, subject to existing market standoff or lock-up agreements. The market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that additional fundraising efforts in the next three years, may trigger an \"ownership change\" limitation in the near future. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income will be subject to limitations, which potentially could result in increased future tax liability to us had we not been subject to such limitations.\nIf our stock becomes publicly tradable, at such time, if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nIf our stock becomes publicly tradable in the future, the trading market for our common stock would depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our Company. If securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our Company, the trading price for our stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains as a return on their investments.\nThere can be no assurance that we will ever provide liquidity to our investors through a sale of our Company.\nWhile acquisitions of pharmaceutical companies like ours are not uncommon, potential investors are cautioned that no assurances can be given that any form of merger, combination, or sale of our Company will take place or that any merger, combination, or sale, even if consummated, would provide liquidity or a profit for our investors. You should not invest in our Company with the expectation that we will be able to sell the business in order to provide liquidity or a profit for our investors.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the potential trading price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management or Board of Directors and adversely affect our stock price.\nProvisions of our amended and restated bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our stock. Among other things, our amended and restated bylaws:\n\u25cf\nprovide that all vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by our Board of Directors and not by stockholders;\n\u25cf\nallow the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose; and\n\u25cf\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \"interested\" stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \"interested\" stockholder.", "PERMNO": 19142, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MNPR"}
