{"cik": "15847", "company": "BUTLER NATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-07-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following statements on risk factors contain \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as \"could,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"intended,\" \"continue,\" \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"expect,\" \"hope,\" \"anticipate,\" \"goal,\" \"forecast,\" \"plan,\" \"guidance\" or \"estimate\" or the negative of these words, variations thereof or similar expressions. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or result and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Stockholders should be aware of certain risks, including those described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which could adversely affect the value of their holdings and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results, financial condition or business over time.\nWe face extensive regulation across our industries, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and limit the prospect of new shareholders acquiring our shares.\nOur Aerospace business is subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"). We manufacture products and parts under FAA Parts Manufacturing Authority requiring qualification and traceability of all materials and vendors used by us. We make aircraft modifications pursuant to the authority granted by Supplemental Type Certificates issued by the FAA. We repair aircraft parts pursuant to the authority granted by our FAA Authorized Repair Station. New or more stringent government regulations may be adopted in the future. Related costs of compliance with or liability for violations of existing or future regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nGaming licenses and/or background investigations (\"license\") are required in connection with our management of a State of Kansas owned Lottery Gaming Facility (a casino). Our management personnel, Butler National and/or the managing subsidiaries, the key personnel of all entities may be required to have a state-issued gaming license. Moreover, our present and future stockholders are, and will continue to be, subject to review by regulatory agencies. The failure of the Company or the key personnel to obtain or retain a license could have a material adverse effect on the Company or on its ability to obtain or retain these licenses in other jurisdictions. Each such State Gaming Agency has broad discretion in granting, renewing, and revoking licenses. Obtaining such licenses and approvals will be time consuming and may be unsuccessful or involve considerable expense, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully operate our business.\nThe State of Kansas has approved state-owned Lottery Gaming Facilities, pari-mutuel dog and/or horse racing for non-Indian organizations. The State of Kansas operates a state lottery, keno games and state-owned Lottery Gaming Facilities for the benefit of the State. The Lottery Gaming Facility management contract approval process requires that any entity or person owning directly or indirectly one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the ownership interest of the management company must be found suitable to be an owner by the State of Kansas.\nIf found unsuitable by any Agency, the stockholder must offer all of the interest in Company stock held by such stockholder to the Company for cash at the current market bid price less a fifteen percent (15%) administrative charge and the Company must purchase such Interest within six (6) months of the offer. The stockholder is required to pay all costs of investigation with respect to a determination of his/her suitability. In addition, regardless of ownership, each member of the Board of Directors and certain officers of the Company are subject to a finding of suitability by any Agency on a regular basis.\nWe are subject to evolving government regulation and law, which may adversely affect our business.\nGaming management operations are and will be subject to extensive gaming laws and regulations, many of which were recently adopted and have not been the subject of definitive interpretations and are still subject to proposed amendments and regulation. The political and regulatory environment in which the Company is and will be operating, with respect to gaming activities, is dynamic and rapidly changing. Adoption and/or changes in gaming laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Interference with the execution of the steps defined by the gaming laws and regulations by interested third parties, although not included by the regulations, may interfere with and or significantly slow the approval process.\nWe may face risks related to the geographic location of our casino.\nBoot Hill Casino is located in Dodge City, Kansas. Consequently, a significant portion of our gaming business is subject to the general economic health of the region around Dodge City, Kansas. The economy of Dodge City, Kansas is significantly influenced by the agricultural sector of the national and local economy, which includes both agricultural farming but also meat processing. As a result, changes in the economic climate, weather patterns, and market fluctuations for agricultural and petroleum products could negatively influence our revenues from gaming and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur Aerospace business is subject to significant customer concentration risk.\nDuring the fiscal year ending April 30, 2019 we derived 25.5% of our revenue from five customers, and we had one \"major customer\" (10 percent or more of consolidated revenue) that provided 15.1% of total sales. A loss of business from, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, one or more of these major customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are attempting to purchase land at Boot Hill Casino and face risks associated with the potential acquisition.\nThe Company currently leases the Boot Hill Casino building and the land on which it is located (\u201cReal Estate\u201d) under the terms of a twenty-five (25) year lease agreement with BHC Development L.C. Under this lease agreement, the Company holds an option to purchase the Real Estate. The Company continues to explore the possibility of purchasing such Real Estate and is currently considering multiple financing options to fund the acquisition. The potential acquisition runs the risk of being delayed by numerous factors outside of our control. One factor is approval of an extension of the Management Agreement with the State of Kansas beyond 2024. There exists the risk the acquisition of Real Estate may not happen at all. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary financing to fund the acquisition on favorable terms. After the closing of any such acquisition of Real Estate, the Company may not realize the potential benefits of the purchase and may be obligated to navigate burdensome debt obligations. If the Management Agreement ends in 2024 without renewal or extension and the acquisition is not exercised, the Company is required to pay the lease payments through 2034 without the revenue from Boot Hill Casino. Both the failure to close the Real Estate acquisition and the possible risks stemming from completing such a transaction, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe operate in a cyclical industry and an economic downturn could negatively impact our operations.\nHistorically, adverse conditions in the local, regional, national and global economies have negatively affected our operations, and may continue to negatively affect our operations in the future. During periods of economic contraction, our revenues may decrease while some of our costs remain fixed or even increase, resulting in decreased earnings.\nThe gaming activities that we offer represent discretionary expenditures and participation in such activities may decline during economic downturns, during which consumers generally earn less disposable income. Even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending in our gaming operations and related facilities, as consumers spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn.\nOur Aerospace business activities and operations are subject to the general health of the aviation industry, which can be cyclical. During periods of economic expansion, when capital spending normally increases, we generally benefit from greater demand for our aviation products and services. During periods of economic contraction, when capital spending normally decreases, we generally are adversely affected by declining demand for our Aerospace products and services. Aviation industry conditions are impacted by numerous factors over which we have no control, including political, regulatory, economic and military conditions, environmental concerns, weather conditions and fuel pricing. Any prolonged cyclical downturn could have a material adverse effect on our Aerospace business, and the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business.\nIncreased competition, including the entry of new competitors, the introduction of new products by new and existing competitors or price competition, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Additionally, because of the rapid rate at which the gaming industry has expanded, and continues to expand, the gaming industry may be at risk of market saturation, both as to specific areas and generally. Overbuilding of gaming facilities by others at particular sites in competitive markets may have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete and on our operations. Competition for the disposable income dollars from the State of Kansas through the Kansas Lottery operating ilottery and sports betting may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause our common stock is deemed a low-priced \"Penny\" stock, an investment in our common stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions.\nSince our common stock is a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act, it will be more difficult for investors to liquidate their investment. Until the trading price of the common stock increases so that it no longer qualifies as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d if ever, trading in the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Exchange Act. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:\n\u25cf\nDeliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;\n\u25cf\nDisclose certain price information about the stock;\n\u25cf\nDisclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;\n\u25cf\nSend monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and\n\u25cf\nIn some circumstances, approve the purchaser's account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules.\nConsequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell the common stock and may affect the ability of holders to sell their common stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nOur 401(k) profit sharing plan results in new shares being issued each year, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nSubject to the annual approval of the Board of Directors, 100% of every pre-tax dollar an employee contributes, up to 6% of the employee\u2019s salary, and a portion of the Company\u2019s profits is matched by the Company. Employees are 100% vested in the Company\u2019s contributions immediately and our matching contribution, as approved by the Board of Directors is paid on an annual basis with common stock of the Company. Competitive retirement plans are a requirement for hiring and retention of employees in the Company\u2019s business segments. The Company\u2019s 401(k) profit sharing plan also encourages employee participation in the 401(k) plan and encourages overall loyalty to the Company. Matching employee contributions with common stock of the Company does lead to a dilution of outstanding common stock, which may result in a lower trading price of our common stock in the future. Historically the Company has attempted to mitigate this dilutive effect by repurchasing the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock through stock buy-back plans; however, the effectiveness of stock buy-back plans is limited due to volume and timing restrictions found in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. Stock repurchase plans are also subject to reauthorization by the Board of Directors from time to time and the Company\u2019s available cash flow.\nWe may conduct a reverse-stock split, which could expose us to certain risks.\nThe possibility of the Company undergoing a reverse-stock split has been discussed at prior annual meetings as a means to increase the common stock share price. We operate in competitive industries and the Company must consider all strategies to increase our common stock share price for stockholders. A reverse stock-split and subsequent increase in the common stock price could elicit a positive market reaction and attract new investors to the Company. There are also risks with a reverse stock-split. The market could react negatively to the consolidation and our common stock could come under renewed selling pressure, which would negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe face risks associated with having executive officers who are family members.\nOur executive team is made up of five (5) individuals who have extensive industry and general business experience. This includes Clark D. Stewart, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Clark\u2019s son, Craig D. Stewart, Vice President. Companies with multiple family members serving on the same executive team can be predisposed to unique internal conflicts, nepotism and/or strategic family alliances. In light of the family relationship within the executive officers of the Company, certain prospective investors may be unwilling to purchase our common stock, which may have a negative effect on our share price.\nWe face risks associated with the renewal of the Boot Hill Casino Management contracts.\nIn December 2009, the State of Kansas awarded the Company a fifteen (15) year term contract to manage the Boot Hill Casino in Dodge City, Kansas. The Company now manages the Boot Hill Casino under the terms of the Management Contract, which is set to expire in December 2024. We cannot guarantee the renewal of the contract and if the contract is renewed, it may be on new and/or different terms. Any decision by the State of Kansas not to renew the contact or to limit or reduce the scope of the contract could adversely affect our business. An inability to obtain a renewal of the Boot Hill Casino Management Contract or a renewal of the agreement on unfavorable terms, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow.\nChanges in governmental regulations of financial reporting could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company reports information to its stockholders and the general public pursuant to the regulations of various Federal and State Commissions and Agencies. These regulations require conformance by the Company to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, to pronouncements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\"PCAOB\"), and to accounting and reporting directives issued by the commissions and agencies. The political and regulatory environment in which the Company operates is dynamic and rapidly changing, and adoption and/or changes in regulations defining accounting procedures or reporting requirements could increase expenditures to report required financial information, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe face risks related to fluctuating fuel and energy costs.\nOur business depends on the use of aircraft fuel for business transportation, freight transportation, and special mission applications. Fluctuations in the global supply of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on aircraft fuel production make it impossible to predict the future availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel. Depending on various global factors that are out of our control, there could be reductions in the production or importation of crude oil and significant increases in the cost of aircraft fuel. This could deter our customers from purchasing fuel and/or inhibit their ability to pass on disproportionate costs to their customers. As a result, the use of business and military aircrafts, the value of aircraft related assets and the revenue related to aircraft equipment and aircraft modifications could decrease. These potential consequences from fluctuating fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur gaming business also depends on the use of automotive fuels for travel to our casino locations in agricultural communities. Increased fuel prices could cause our customers to determine that fuel is not available or too expensive to justify travel, which may cause our gaming business to be adversely affected.\nWe face risks due to our fixed-price contracts.\nWe sell certain products and services to commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed units prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The costs of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nDifficulties or delays in the development, production, testing and marketing of products, could adversely affect our business.\nOur Aerospace business is subject, in part, to regulatory procedures and administration enacted by and/or administered by the FAA. Accordingly, our business may be adversely affected in the event the Company is unable to comply with such regulations relative to its current products and/or if any new products and/or services to be offered by the Company are not formally approved by such agency. Our proposed aviation modification products depend upon the issuance by the FAA of a Supplemental Type Certificate with related parts manufacturing authority. Such certifications for future aircraft modification products may not be issued within our expected time frames or issued at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, the loss of one or more of our current licenses or certifications could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business requires financing and financing is dependent upon the stability of economic markets.\nThe Company depends upon financial institutions for financing to continue operations and to finance and develop new opportunities. The status of the national economy and its growth outlook could be affected by volatility and/or a disruption of capital and credit markets, which could negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to access credit financing. As a result, we may not be able to secure credit financing on terms attractive to us and if we are able to secure financing arrangements, the amount may be insufficient to meet all of our current and future needs to continue operations and finance and develop new opportunities.\nCyber-security threats or other disruptions to our technology infrastructure could harm our business.\nOur use of electronic data storage, automated systems and technology gives rise to cyber-security risks. Although we and our third-party providers have preventive systems and processes in place designed to protect against the risk of system failure and cyber-attacks, a security breach of our systems or those of our third-party providers may cause a disruption of our business or expose us to a loss of information or litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations.\nActs of terrorism and war could disrupt our business.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility create many economic and political uncertainties. We cannot predict the extent to which terrorism, security alerts, war, or hostilities throughout the world will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results. Because of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for certain insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. Given current conditions in the global insurance markets, we are substantially uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. If any such event were to affect our properties, it would likely adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nInclement weather, natural disasters and other conditions could seriously disrupt our business and operations.\nOur gaming operations are subject to the weather and other conditions that could disrupt or reduce the number of customers who visit our casino. If weather conditions limit consumer access to our casino or otherwise adversely impact our ability to operate our casino at full capacity, our revenue could suffer, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe also face risks that the weather and other conditions could adversely affect the local industries in Dodge City, Kansas, where the Boot Hill Casino is located. The local economy in Dodge City is primarily fueled by the agriculture and meat processing industries. In the event the weather and/or other conditions severely disrupt these industries, we could see a reduction in the number of customers who visit our casino, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results in operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nIn addition, natural disasters such as major fires, floods, tornados and earthquakes could also adversely impact our business and operating results. Such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of the facilities for which we provide management services for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely impacted.\nIn most situations, we have insurance that should provide coverage for portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, is beyond our control.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur inability to retain key personnel may be critical to our ability to achieve our objectives. Key personnel are particularly important in maintaining relationships with the operations related to the FAA and the State of Kansas. Loss of any such personnel could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of these key persons, whose knowledge, leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace, and on our ability to attract and retain experienced professional staff. While we currently have an employment agreement with our CEO, Clark D. Stewart, if we were to lose the services of Mr. Stewart or other key persons, our ability to execute our business plan would be harmed and we may be forced to cease operations until such time as we could hire suitable replacements.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with our international sales.\nOur international sales may be subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices which may differ from U.S. Federal Government regulation, including regulations related to products being installed on aircraft, exchange controls, as well to varying currency, geo-political and economic risks. We are also exposed to risks associated with any relationships with foreign representatives, consultants, partners and suppliers for international sales and operations. Our ability to arrange safe travel to visit our international customers may put our ability to sell such customers at risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nFuture acquisitions and investments may expose us to certain risks.\nWe continually review, evaluate and consider potential investments and acquisitions in pursuing our business strategy. In evaluating such transactions, we are making difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risk and cost of potential liabilities. Acquisitions and investments involve certain other risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses, the challenges in reaching our strategic objectives, benefits expected from acquisitions or investments, cost and revenue synergies, and risk that markets do not evolve as anticipated and the targeted opportunity or technology do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets. Other risks include the diversion of our attention and resources from our current operations, the potential of impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses.\nWe are subject to certain change of control restrictions, which could make it more difficult to be acquired.\nSome provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and our Shareholder Rights Agreement could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. This includes, but is not limited to, provisions that: provide for a classified Board of Directors, prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent, and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Kansas law K.S.A. 17-6427 that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. In light of the highly regulated nature of our business and the authority of the regulatory agencies that monitor business to monitor the composition of our shareholders, the Board has consistently believed these restrictions are appropriate. Nonetheless, these restrictions may result in missed opportunities for the Company and could result in a reduced share price of our common stock, which would harm our business.\nWe may be required in the future to record impairment losses related to assets we currently carry on our balance sheet.\nWe evaluate intangible assets, such as goodwill, for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and in any interim period in which circumstances arise that indicate our intangible asset may be impaired. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business and/or significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. No events occurred during the periods presented indicated the existence of an impairment with respect to our intangible assets. Preparation of forecasts for use in the long-range plan and the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments that we base primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders and general market conditions. Significant changes in these forecasts or the discount rate selected could affect the estimated fair value and could result in an impairment charge in a future period.\nWe are subject to extensive taxation policies, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe federal government has, from time to time, considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future. If such an increase were to be enacted, our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future to finance casino development projects could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees, in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time.\nBoot Hill Casino, pursuant to its Management Contract with the State of Kansas pays total taxes between 27% and 31% of gross gaming revenue, based on achievement of the following revenue levels: 27% on gross gaming revenue up to $180 million, 29% on amounts from $180 million to $220 million, and 31% on amounts above $220 million in gross gaming revenue. Boot Hill Casino is contractually obligated to pay its proportionate share of certain expenses incurred by the Kansas Lottery Commission and the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission, which amounted to $2.3 million during fiscal year ended April 30, 2019.", "PERMNO": 20002, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "BUKS"}
