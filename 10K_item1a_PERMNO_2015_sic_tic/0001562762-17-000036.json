{"cik": "1518222", "company": "Bankrate, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves risk. You should carefully consider the following risks as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes, before investing in our securities. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and cause the value of our securities to decline, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\ufeff\nOur success depends on revenue from online advertising and the sale of financial and senior care consumer inquiries.\nWe have historically derived, and we expect to continue to derive, the majority of our revenue through the monetization of consumer inquiries and the sale of advertising impressions on our online network. Any factors that reduce the amount our customers are willing to and do spend on advertising with us, or that limit their willingness to purchase consumer inquiries from us, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. These factors may include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain a significant number of unique website visitors, mobile visitors and application users;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness or interest of banks, credit card issuers, lenders, brokers, senior care providers and other advertisers in the business verticals in which we operate to advertise on our websites or mobile applications or purchase our leads, clicks, calls and referrals;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of conversion of visitors to some of our websites or mobile applications into credit card applicants and the rate at which credit card applications from consumers that come through our websites or mobile applications are approved by our credit card issuer customers;\n\u00b7\nchanges in law or regulation, or the enforcement of laws or regulations, including without limitation with respect to the advertising of personal financial services or senior care services, the provision of financial product consumer inquiries or senior care consumer inquiries, or privacy;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of conversion of consumers\u2019 visits to our websites or mobile applications into transaction fees and/or revenue from banks, mortgage brokers or other lenders;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of conversion of consumers\u2019 visits to our websites or mobile applications into senior care referrals and the rate at which those referrals result in move-ins with our senior care customers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to compete with alternative advertising sources;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain a significant number of sellable impressions generated from website visitors available to advertisers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to accurately assess the number and demographic characteristics of our visitors;\n\u00b7\nour ability to handle temporary high volume traffic spikes to our online network;\n\u00b7\nour ability to convince traditional media advertisers to advertise on our online network; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to increase traffic to our online network.\n\ufeff\nMost of our customer contracts are short-term and are subject to termination by the customer at any time and/or do not have any minimum purchase requirements. Customers who have longer-term contracts may fail to honor their existing contracts, choose not to renew their contracts or reduce their purchase volume under those contracts. If a significant number of customers or a few large customers decide not to continue advertising with us or purchasing our consumer inquiries, or materially reduce such activities, we could experience an immediate and substantial decline in our revenues and operating results over a relatively short period of time.\n\ufeff\nWe face intense competitive pressures that may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face intense competition in all our businesses, and we expect competition to remain intense in the future. We compete with, among others, search engines utilizing keyword cost-per-click advertising or comparison advertising sites/networks; lead aggregators and websites committed to specific personal finance or senior care products; numerous websites in each of our vertical categories competing for traffic and for advertisers; financial institutions, including mortgage lenders, deposit institutions, credit card issuers and other lenders, many of whom are also our customers; and traditional offline personal finance marketing channels, including direct mail, retail bank branch networks, television, radio, call centers and print advertising. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do and could use those resources to develop more directly competitive product offerings and editorial content and undertake advertising campaigns to promote those new offerings and content, which could result in diminished traffic to our online services and reduce our overall competitive and market position.\n\ufeff\nOur online competitors may adopt certain aspects of our business model or replicate the appearance and features of our online services, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our services. In addition, new competitors may enter this market as there are few barriers to entry. If one of these competitors is successful in such efforts, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results. For example, prior to Google\u2019s termination of its Google Compare product in early 2016, Google Compare presented prominent comparisons of credit cards through its search engine, and in certain markets presented prominent comparisons of mortgage rates through its search engine. This diverted consumers away from our online services, including consumers who would otherwise have found, been directed to or been linked to our online services through the Google search engine. This diversion adversely impacted our business and operating results. In the future Google may choose to reenter our business verticals, or make available new products that compete with other parts of our business such as deposit rates, auto loans, personal loans or other rate information and tools (e.g., mortgage calculators) with similar adverse effect.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical or marketing resources than us. Many competitors have complementary products or services that drive traffic to their online services. In the future, competitors could introduce superior products and services or reduce prices below ours. Increased competition could result in lower consumer traffic, advertising rate reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend upon Internet search engines to attract a significant portion of the visitors to our websites, and any change in the prominence of our websites in search result listings or changes the visual layout of those listings could cause the number of visitors and/or the quality of those visitors to our websites to decline and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe depend in significant part on various Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, and other search websites to direct a significant number of visitors to our websites to provide our online services to our clients. Search websites typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and paid listings. Algorithmic, or organic, listings are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by search companies. Paid listings can be purchased and then are displayed if particular words are included in a user\u2019s Internet search. Placement in paid listings is generally not determined solely on the bid price, but also takes into account the search engines\u2019 assessment of the quality of the website featured in the paid listing and other factors. We rely on both algorithmic and paid search results, as well as advertising on other websites, to direct a substantial share of the visitors to our websites.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to maintain the number of visitors to our websites from Internet search engines and other websites is not entirely within our control. Internet search engines frequently revise their algorithms in an attempt to optimize their search result listings or to implement their internal standards and strategies. Changes in the algorithms could cause our websites to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of users who visit our websites. We have experienced and continue to experience fluctuations in the search result rankings for a number of our websites. Even where our search result rankings do not fluctuate, an Internet search website could take other steps to displace the placement of our websites on a search results page or otherwise change the visual layout of the search results page, which can reduce the number of consumer visits to our websites and adversely affect our business and operating results. For example, in early 2016 Google increased the number of paid advertisements at the top of its search results, which adversely impacted the number of consumers that click through to the websites managed by our businesses and adversely affected our business and operating results.\nIn addition, the prominence of the placement of our advertisements is in part determined by the amount we are willing to pay for the advertisement. We bid against our competitors for the display of paid search engine advertisements and some of our competitors have greater resources with which to bid and better brand recognition than we have. If competition for the display of paid advertisements in response to search terms related to our online services increases, our online advertising expenses could rise significantly or we may be required to reduce the number of our paid search advertisements. If we were to reduce our advertising with search engines, our consumer traffic may significantly decline or we may be unable to maintain a cost-effective search engine marketing program.\n\ufeff\nOther factors, such as search engine technical difficulties, search engine technical changes and technical or presentation changes we make to our websites, could also cause our websites to be listed less prominently in algorithmic search results. In addition, search engines retain broad discretion to remove from search results any company whose marketing practices are deemed to be inconsistent with the search engine\u2019s guidelines. If our marketing practices do not comply with search engine guidelines, we may, without warning, not appear in search result listings at all. Any adverse effect on the placement of our websites in search engine results could reduce the number of users who visit our websites. In turn, any reduction in the number of visitors to our websites would negatively affect our ability to earn revenue. If visits to our websites decrease, our revenue may decline or we may need to resort to more costly sources to replace lost visitors, and such decreased revenue and/or increased expense could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nWe depend on third parties for a portion of our credit card, banking and senior care traffic and revenues, and any material decline in our relationships with these third parties, or increase in the price of consumer inquiries from these third parties, could have an adverse impact on our revenues or operating results.\nA portion of our revenue is attributable to consumer inquiries sourced from third parties, including but not limited to website publishers, lead aggregators and email marketers. In many instances, these third parties can change the inventory they make available to us at any time and, therefore, impact our revenue. If these third parties decide not to make inventory available to us, are purchased by one of our competitors or another company that decides to no longer make inventory available to us, or decides to demand a higher price for their products, we may not be able to find replacement inventory from other sources that satisfy our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues or operating results.\nIf we fail to keep pace with rapidly-changing technologies and industry standards, including without limitation the increasing shift by consumers to mobile devices from personal computers and the increasing use of social media channels, we could lose consumers, customers or advertising inventory and our results of operations may suffer.\nThe business lines in which we currently operate and compete are characterized by rapidly-changing Internet media and marketing standards, changing technologies and platforms, frequent new product and service introductions, and changing consumer and customer demands and modes of accessing and providing information. The number of individuals who access the Internet through devices other than a personal computer, such as tablets and smartphones, has increased dramatically. The introduction of new technologies and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technologies and services obsolete and unmarketable or require unanticipated investments in technology. If consumers find our online services difficult to access through alternative devices or our competitors develop product offerings that are better adapted to or more easily accessible through alternative devices, we may fail to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services and may fail to attract both advertisers and online traffic.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to these rapidly-changing digital media formats and platforms and other technologies and platforms, including without limitation new online and mobile technologies. We will need to enhance our existing technologies and services and develop and introduce new technologies and services to address our customers\u2019 changing demands and consumer expectations and the ways consumers access online information. For example, consumers are increasingly using online social media channels, such as Facebook, as a means to communicate and exchange information, including information and opinions regarding financial services and senior care. We believe this trend will continue and we will need to better develop our ability to attract new consumers and deploy effective advertising solutions using these social media channels or other new platforms that develop. In addition, we believe that successful execution on a social media strategy will be important to diversify away from our dependence on search engines. If we fail to adapt successfully to such developments in a timely manner or if the execution of our social media strategy is not successful, we could lose consumers and customers, our expenses could increase and we could lose advertising inventory, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew technologies that block online advertisements could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of advertisements and that provide tools to consumers to opt out of advertising products. A portion of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of advertisements on the web pages of our websites and those of our business partners or in connection with certain actions consumers take with respect to those advertisements. As a result, technologies that prevent or diminish our ability to display advertisements to consumers, or the ability of consumers to click on such advertisements tools could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur websites, applications, widgets and other products may encounter technical problems, service interruptions or security failures.\nIn the past, our websites have experienced significant increases in traffic and our applications and widgets have experienced significant increases in use in response to interest rate movements and other business or financial news events. The number of our visitors has continued to increase over time, and we are seeking to further increase our visitor traffic. As a result, our servers must accommodate spikes in demand for our web pages in addition to potential significant growth in traffic.\nOur websites, applications, widgets and other products have in the past, and may in the future, experience slower response times or interruptions as a result of increased traffic or for other reasons. These delays and interruptions may increase in the future if our servers and infrastructure are not able to accommodate potential significant traffic growth and spikes in demand. Delays and interruptions resulting from the failure to maintain service connections to our websites or applications could frustrate visitors and reduce future traffic on our online platforms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur principal communications, networking and operations equipment is located in commercial co-location data centers and through Amazon Web Services. Additional communications, networking and operations equipment is located at our office locations in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and Austin, Texas, as well as other of our locations. Multiple system or network failures or catastrophic loss of facility involving these locations, particularly data centers, could lead to interruptions or delays in service for our websites or applications, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, we are dependent on third-party providers and their ability to provide safe, effective and cost-efficient hardware and operating environments. Our operations are dependent upon our ability, and our third-party providers\u2019 ability, to protect our systems against damage from fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, acts of terrorism, hacker attacks and other events beyond our control. If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we maintain insurance to cover a variety of risks, the scope and amount of our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses resulting from system or security failures or other disruptions to our online operations.\nFraudulent Internet transactions, consumer identity theft, security breaches and privacy concerns could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation.\nIf consumers experience identity theft, data security breaches or fraud after clicking through one of our websites or mobile applications to apply for credit cards on the websites of credit card issuers, or mortgage or deposit products or other loan or banking products on the websites of brokers, lenders or banks, or following the completion of a lead form, or as a result of the use of our My.CreditCards, myBankrate, Quizzle, Score&Report, Wallaby or other platforms or services, we may be exposed to significant liability, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. Despite our implementation of security measures, our computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches. In addition, we depend on vendors to store or process certain information, some of which may be private or include personally-identifiable information. If these vendors fail to maintain adequate information security systems, or in the event they experience a breach of their networks, and consumer information is compromised, our business, reputation or results of operations could be significantly harmed. In addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or consumers to disclose information in order to gain access to consumer data. Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally-identifiable information of consumers using our services could significantly harm our reputation, impair our ability to attract consumers and attract and retain our advertisers, subject us to regulatory inquiry, investigation and claims, and subject us to private claims or litigation alleging damages suffered by consumers, any of which alone or together could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTo the extent that fraud or identity theft causes a general decline in consumer confidence in online financial transactions, our revenues could decline and our reputation could be damaged. If consumers are reluctant to use our services because of concerns over data privacy or fraud, our ability to generate revenues would be impaired. Our revenues would also decline if changes in industry standards, regulations or laws deterred people from using online services to conduct transactions, such as applying for credit cards, or from seeking information or services that involve the transmission of confidential information. In addition, if technology upgrades or other expenditures are required to prevent security breaches of our network, boost general consumer confidence in sharing information or conducting financial transactions using online services, or prevent fraud and identity theft, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources. Further, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we use to protect consumers\u2019 and customer companies\u2019 confidential information, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business depends on a strong brand and content, thus we will not be able to attract visitors and advertisers if we do not maintain and develop our brands and content.\nIt is critical for us to maintain and develop our brands and content so as to effectively expand our visitor base and our revenues. Our success in promoting and enhancing our brands, as well as our ability to remain relevant and competitive, depends on our success in offering high quality content, features, product offers, services and functionality. In addition, we may take actions that have the unintended consequence of harming our brand. If our actions cause consumers to question the value of our marketplace, our business and reputation may suffer. If we fail to promote our brands successfully or if visitors to our websites, users of our applications, or advertisers do not perceive our content and services to be of high quality, we may not be able to continue growing our business and attracting visitors and advertisers, which will in turn negatively impact our operating results.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate significantly.\nOur results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nchanges in fees paid by our customers or customer demand for our services;\n\u00b7\ntraffic levels on our websites and mobile applications, which can fluctuate significantly;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the demand for online products and services;\n\u00b7\nchanges in fee or revenue-sharing arrangements with our distribution partners;\n\u00b7\nchanges in application approval rates by our credit card issuer customers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enter into or renew key distribution agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new advertising services by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nfailure by advertisers or their agencies to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\u00b7\nfailure by our credit card customers to timely report, or to report at all, approved credit card applications for consumers that come through our websites;\n\u00b7\nfailure by our senior care customers to timely report, or to report at all, completed move-ins of the consumers that come through our websites;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our capital or operating expenses;\n\u00b7\nchanges in consumer confidence;\n\u00b7\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial services, senior care-related, or privacy laws or regulations, or other laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretations or enforcement by government regulators of such laws or regulations.\n\ufeff\nOur future revenue and results of operations are difficult to forecast due to these factors as well as other factors. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on past periods as indicators of future performance.\nFailure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over our financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.\nWe have concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and that, as a result, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at such date. See Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are in the process of implementing efforts to remediate the identified material weakness.\nThere can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that we will not experience any other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. Any such lapses or deficiencies could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. An inability to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, including litigation brought by private individuals, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and our stock price.\nOur visitor traffic can be impacted by interest rate volatility.\nWe provide interest rate information for credit cards, mortgages and other loans, and a variety of deposit accounts. Visitor traffic to our online platforms tends to increase with interest rate movements. Factors that have caused significant visitor fluctuations in the past have been Federal Reserve Board actions and general market conditions affecting home mortgage and deposit interest rates and access to credit. Additionally, the level of traffic to our websites can be dependent on interest rate levels as well as mortgage financing and refinancing activity. Accordingly, a slowdown in mortgage production or refinancing volumes could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Conversely, a sudden, significant change in interest rates could dramatically increase our page views such that we would be unable to sell sufficient advertisements to take full advantage of the spike in traffic.\nRisks associated with our strategic acquisitions or dispositions could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe have acquired a number of companies and assets of companies in the past and may make additional acquisitions, asset purchases and strategic investments in the future. For example, in April 2015 we completed the acquisition of Quizzle, LLC (owner of Quizzle.com) and in June 2016 we completed the acquisition of the NextAdvisor business. We will continue to consider acquisitions, asset purchases and joint ventures as a means of enhancing stockholder value. Our success in integrating our acquired businesses will depend upon our ability to retain key personnel, avoid diversion of management\u2019s attention from operational matters, integrate the technical operations and personnel of the acquired companies, and achieve the expected financial results, synergies and other benefits from our acquisitions.\nIn addition, future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs and contingent liabilities. Integration of acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated.\nIt is also possible that expected synergies and other benefits from our acquisitions may not materialize in full or at all. We may also incur costs and divert management attention through potential acquisitions that are never consummated. Future impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life recorded in connection with an acquisition, or restructuring charges, could also occur and negatively affect our results of operations.\nDespite our due diligence investigation of an acquisition target, there may be liabilities of the seller companies that we fail to or are unable to discover during the due diligence investigation and for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible and which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In connection with acquisitions, we generally seek to minimize the impact of these types of potential liabilities through the structure of the transaction or through indemnities and warranties from the seller, which may in some instances be supported by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price or use of an escrow. However, these indemnities and warranties, if obtained, may not fully cover the liabilities due to limitations in scope, amount or duration, financial limitations of the indemnitor or warrantor, or other reasons.\nIn connection with a disposition of assets or a business, we may provide a buyer with certain indemnities or warranties, such as was the case with the disposition of our Insurance business at the end of 2015. There may also be liabilities or obligations we retain with respect to the sold assets or business. Liability from these indemnities or warranties, or from any retained liabilities or obligations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as could any successful invocation by the buyer of contract provisions that permit post-closing adjustments to the purchase price.\nOur ability to consummate any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands, our resources and our ability to obtain financing.\nWe depend on attracting and retaining executive officers and personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our senior management team and other skilled employees. The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or of other key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our senior management team possesses valuable knowledge about our business and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Our success and the quality of our content also depend on the expertise of our writers and bloggers and on their relationships with consumers, the media, financial experts and other sources of information. For example, the performance of The Points Guy business has been driven by the ability of the founder of that business and his team to connect with and grow the target audience of that business. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIf our employees were to unionize, our operating costs would likely increase.\nNone of our employees are currently represented by a union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. However, we have no assurance that some or all of our employees will not unionize in the future, which could increase our operating costs, result in other business challenges, force us to alter our operating methods, and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are from time to time involved in, or may in the future be subject to, claims, suits, government inquiries or investigations, and other proceedings that may have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are from time to time involved in, or may in the future be subject to, claims, suits, government inquiries or investigations, and proceedings arising from our business or the fact that we are a public company, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, privacy, consumer protection, information security, securities laws and regulations, transactions in which we are involved, data protection or law enforcement matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial claims, as well as shareholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits, and other matters. We are also at risk where we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings or from direct harm, including without limitation in connection with the sale of our Insurance business. Such claims, suits, inquiries, investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Defense costs and any resulting damage awards or settlement amounts may not be fully covered by our insurance policies. Regardless of the outcome, any such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of attention of management and other personnel, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm, liability, penalties, or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices, products or technologies, which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, accounting rules may require us to record a liability related to a particular matter prior to its resolution if the incurrence of a loss related to such matter becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn addition to litigation in the ordinary course of business, we are currently involved in litigation in which it has been alleged that we have participated in anti-competitive conduct. See the description of the Banxcorp litigation in Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements in this report. Antitrust litigation is by its nature not in the ordinary course. Defending antitrust allegations, even if ultimately successful, can be costly and have a negative effect on our business. In addition, the relief sought by the plaintiffs in this case, if granted, could prevent Bankrate from continuing to pursue at least some aspects of its current business model, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results.\nWe make product and investment decisions that may have the effect of reducing our short-term revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions benefit the consumer experience, conversion rates and/or the pricing of our products or services, thereby ultimately improving our financial performance over the long-term. For example, we have reduced the cost-per-click pricing on certain of our rate tables at certain times to increase the number of advertisers and thereby increase the number of search results that appear in response to a consumer query. Any short-term reductions in revenue or profitability could be more severe than we anticipate or these decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our relationships with consumers and advertisers and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nInsurance coverage may not be available to cover all of our potential liability and available coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims that we may incur.\nOur ability to obtain liability insurance, its coverage levels, deductibles, premiums and exclusions are all dependent on market factors, our loss history and insurers\u2019 perception of our overall risk profile. We cannot ensure that our insurance will cover all claims or that insurance coverage will be available at economically acceptable rates. Significant uninsured liabilities could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are self-insured for our health benefits. We estimate future expenditures and establish accruals (reserves) based on the estimates. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to operational risk.\nWe are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. We are also exposed to operational risk through the aspects of our business that we outsource, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business. Although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone business opportunities, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe rely on the protection of our intellectual property.\nOur intellectual property includes our unique research and editorial content of our websites, our applications, our domain names, our URLs, our trade secrets and know-how, our registered and unregistered trademarks and our print publications. We rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, and our policy and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our websites, mobile applications or print publications without authorization. A failure to protect our intellectual property in a meaningful manner could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that we violated intellectual property rights of others, which even if unfounded or decided in our favor may be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to operate.\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may in the future receive notices that claim we have misappropriated or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held by others, including issued or pending patents and trademarks, that cover significant aspects of our technologies, content, branding or business methods.\nBecause we license some of our data and content from other parties, we may be exposed to infringement actions if such parties do not possess the necessary proprietary rights. Generally, we obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of licensed content and obtain indemnification to cover any breach of any of these representations. However, these representations may not be accurate and the indemnification may be limited or otherwise may not be sufficient to provide adequate compensation for any breach of these representations.\nAny future infringement or other claims or prosecutions related to our intellectual property could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Defending against any of these claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to introduce new content or trademarks, develop new technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. These royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may face liability for, and may be subject to claims related to, information on our websites or mobile applications, which even if unfounded or decided in our favor may be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to operate.\nMuch of the information published on our online platforms and in our print publications relates to the competitiveness of financial institutions\u2019 rates, products and services. We also publish editorial and other content designed to educate consumers about banking, personal finance and senior care products, and on certain of our websites provide a platform for user-generated content. If the information we provide is not accurate or is construed as misleading or outdated, consumers and others could lose confidence in our services and attempt to hold us liable for damages and government regulators could impose fines or penalties on us. We may be subjected to claims of violations of law or regulation, and claims for defamation, negligence, discrimination, invasion of personal privacy, fraud, deceptive practices, copyright or trademark infringement, conflicts of interest or other theories relating to the information we publish. We may also be exposed to similar liability in connection with content that users post to our websites through ratings, reviews, forums, blogs, comments, and other social media features. In addition, if there are errors or omissions in information we publish, consumers, individually or through consumer class actions, could seek damages from us for losses incurred if they relied on incorrect information we provided. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against providers of online services as well as print publications. The scope and amount of our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claims.\nWe may face liability for, and may be subject to claims related to, inaccurate advertising content provided to us, which even if unfounded or decided in our favor may be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to operate.\nMuch of the information on our online platforms that is provided by advertisers and collected from third parties relates to the rates, costs and features for various loan, depository, personal credit and investment products offered by financial institutions, mortgage companies, investment companies and others participating in the personal finance marketplace, and for providers of senior care facilities. We are exposed to the risk that some advertisers may provide us, or directly post on our websites or mobile applications, (i) inaccurate information about their product rates, costs and features, or (ii) rates, costs and features that are not available to all consumers. This could cause consumers to lose confidence in the information we provide, causing certain advertisers to become dissatisfied with our services, and result in lawsuits being filed or regulatory action against us which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The scope and amount of our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of lawsuits or actions.\nOur success depends on establishing and maintaining distribution arrangements.\nOur business strategy includes the distribution of our content through the establishment of co-branded web pages with high traffic business and personal finance sections of third party online services and websites. Providing access to these co-branded web pages is a significant part of the value we offer to our advertisers. We compete with other providers of services similar to ours to maintain our current relationships with these third party online operators and establish new relationships. In addition, as we expand our personal finance content or change our services, or as these third party online operators acquire or develop their own services, some of these third party online operators may perceive us as a competitor. As a result, they may be unwilling to promote distribution of our content or services. If our distribution arrangements do not attract a sufficient number of visitors to support our current advertising model, or if we do not establish and maintain distribution arrangements on favorable economic terms, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe do not have exclusive relationships or long-term contracts with the banks, credit card issuers, mortgage brokers and lenders, other lenders, or senior care companies that are our customers, which may limit our ability to retain these customers as participants in our marketplace and maintain the attractiveness of our services to consumers.\nWe do not have exclusive relationship with the banks, credit card issuers, mortgage brokers and lenders, other lenders, or senior care companies whose products are advertised on our online marketplace, and thus, consumers may obtain services or products from these companies without using our services. Many of our customers also offer their products directly to consumers through agents, mass marketing campaigns or other traditional methods of distribution. In many cases, our customers also offer their products and services online, either directly to consumers or through one or more of our online competitors, or both. An inability to retain these customers as participants in our marketplace could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues and results of operations.\nOur credit card and senior care revenue is concentrated among a small number of customers.\nA significant portion of the revenue in our credit card and senior care businesses is generated from a small number of trade customers. Our credit card business revenue is concentrated among six of the major credit card issuers and therefore the loss of any one of these issuers as a customer, or a significant reduction in business with an issuer, could meaningfully reduce our credit cards business revenue. We also expect that a meaningful portion of our senior care referral revenues will continue to depend on referral fees from a small group of customers. The loss of one of these customers, or a significant reduction in advertising spend with us by one of these customers, could meaningfully reduce our senior care referral revenue. Industry consolidation resulting in a combination of customers in either of these businesses could also result in the loss of a customer, or a significant reduction in business with a customer, which could meaningfully reduce our revenues. In addition, if a significant customer in either of these businesses experiences operating issues, regulatory issues, bad publicity or other problems, the fees we receive from that customer may be materially reduced.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired.\nWe are required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and may be tested at other times if a triggering event occurs. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include, among others, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, or a significant adverse change in the business environment or performance of the reporting unit. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined. This could adversely impact our results of operations. During the second quarter 2016 management noted that the operating results of its Banking reporting unit had begun to track below plan, primarily due to macroeconomic trends impacting its deposit and display advertising businesses. This triggering event resulted in impairment testing as of June 30, 2016 where it was concluded that the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill was impaired, and we recorded a $25.0 million expense for the impairment. In the third quarter 2016, as a result of management\u2019s revision of the strategy of its Quizzle reporting unit and integration of the Quizzle operations into the Banking segment, management determined that a triggering event for impairment testing at the pre-realigned Quizzle reporting unit had occurred. An estimated impairment of goodwill for the pre-realigned Quizzle reporting unit of $4.2 million was recorded as of September 30, 2016. The impairment analysis for Quizzle was completed in the fourth quarter 2016, and we recorded an additional $2.4 million impairment to goodwill and $7.5 million impairment to intangible assets for the pre-realigned Quizzle reporting unit. During the fourth quarter 2016, management noted that the operating results of its Senior Care reporting unit was tracking below plan, resulting in a triggering event for impairment testing as of December 31, 2016. It was concluded that the reporting unit goodwill was impaired and we recorded a $4.0 million expense for the impairment of goodwill.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by adverse tax events.\nNew sales or use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Such enactments could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us, or our conclusions regarding the applicability of existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances could be incorrect. These events could require us to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us to pay fees, penalties and/or interest for past amounts deemed to be due. In addition, our revenue may decline because we may have to charge more for our services which could reduce demand for those services.\nNew, changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could also increase our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our products or services. Further, these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business. Any or all of these events could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nUnfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect us.\nOur tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may expand to other international markets, in addition to our United Kingdom operations, in which we may have limited experience.\nWe have websites for consumers located in the United Kingdom. In the event that we expand into other international markets, we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services in those markets. Expansion into international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources, may require the attraction, retention and management of local offices or personnel, and requires us to tailor our services and information to the local market as well as to adapt to local cultures, languages, regulations and standards. Certain international markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting the Internet as an advertising and commerce medium or in developing telecommunications or online infrastructure and so our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment. In addition, international consumers may not adopt the Internet for personal finance content at all or as frequently as U.S. consumers.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nWe face certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ntrade barriers and changes in trade regulations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the use of or access to the Internet;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u00b7\ncredit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\npolitical or social unrest or economic instability;\n\u00b7\nseasonal volatility in business activity;\n\u00b7\nrisks related to compliance with applicable regulations, including but not limited to anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u00b7\nrisks related to government regulation or required compliance with local laws in certain jurisdictions, including labor laws; and\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nOne or more of these factors could harm our future international operations and consequently, could harm our brand, business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we fail to detect click-through fraud or other invalid clicks, other fraud on advertisements or unscrupulous advertisers, we could lose the confidence of our other advertisers or our customers and all or part of their business, thereby causing our business to suffer or resulting in adverse regulatory actions.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraudulent or other invalid clicks on our advertisements or actions with respect to our consumer inquiry sources. We may in the future have to refund revenue that our advertisers or customers have paid to us and that was later attributed to, or suspected to be caused by fraud or other invalid clicks. Fraudulent or other invalid clicks may result in us receiving advertising fees that are not the result of clicks generated by consumers. Click-through fraud occurs when a person or automated system clicks on an advertisement displayed on a website with the intent of generating the revenue share payment to the publisher rather than to view the underlying content. Action fraud occurs when on-line forms are completed with false or fictitious information in an effort to increase the compensable actions in respect of which the recipient of such information is to be compensated. We do not charge our advertisers or customers for fraudulent or certain other invalid clicks or actions when they are detected, and such fraudulent or invalid activities could negatively affect our profitability or harm our reputation. If fraudulent or other invalid clicks or actions are not detected, the affected advertisers or customers may experience a reduced return on their investment in our programs, which could lead the advertisers or customers to become dissatisfied with our campaigns, and in turn, lead to loss of advertisers or customers and the related revenue.\nWe are also exposed to the risk that advertisers who advertise on our website will advertise interest rates or other terms on a variety of financial products that they do not intend to honor. This \u201cbait and switch\u201d activity encourages consumers to contact fraudulent advertisers over legitimate advertisers because the fraudulent advertisers claim to offer better interest rates or other terms. Such activity could hurt our reputation and our brand and lead to our other advertisers becoming dissatisfied with our advertising programs, which could lead to loss of advertisers and revenue. It could also result in regulatory action against us, including without limitation by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) or the CFPB, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRegulation of the Internet is uncertain and subject to change.\nLaws and regulations that apply to online communications, commerce and advertising are continuously evolving and developing and the extent of future government regulation is uncertain. Federal and state laws and regulations govern various aspects of our online business, including intellectual property ownership and infringement, trade secrets, the distribution of electronic communications, marketing and advertising, sweepstakes and promotions, user privacy and data security, search engines and Internet tracking technologies. Additionally, taxation of online services or electronic commerce transactions may be imposed. Future laws, regulations or taxation, or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations, could result in a decline in the use of online services and the viability of Internet commerce, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nLaws and regulations may limit, restrict or place additional requirements on the way we operate our business or establish and maintain our online relationships, and may subject us to liabilities, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe market and provide services in heavily regulated industries through a number of different channels across the United States and abroad. As a result, our businesses have been and remain subject to a variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions in the United States as well as other countries, which are subject to change at any time. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, or to obtain and maintain required licenses, we could be subject to fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or private litigation, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal, state and foreign lending laws and regulations generally require accurate disclosure of the critical components of credit costs so that consumers can readily compare credit terms from various lenders. These laws and regulations also impose certain restrictions on the advertisement of these credit terms. Because we are an aggregator of rate and other information regarding many financial products, including mortgages, deposits and credit cards, we may be subject to some of these laws and regulations and we may be held liable under these laws and regulations for information provided through our online services.\nWe conduct marketing activities using the telephone, email and other online marketing channels to generate consumer inquiries for our business. The marketing industry is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, state telemarketing laws, federal and state privacy laws, the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d) and the Federal Trade Commission Act and its accompanying regulations and guidelines, among others. Foreign laws and regulations, such as the Canadian Anti-Spam Law (\u201cCASL\u201d), may also apply to our business activities to the extent we are doing business with or marketing to consumers in foreign jurisdictions.\nMost of the statutes and regulations in the United States (and certain foreign statutes and regulations, such as CASL) allow a private right of action for the recovery of damages or provide for enforcement by the FTC, CFPB, Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), other governmental bodies, state attorneys general or state agencies permitting the recovery of significant civil or criminal penalties, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees in the event that regulations are violated. We believe that we comply with all such applicable laws and regulations, and try to obtain assurances that our advertisers, third party partners, and third parties that we rely on for telemarketing, email marketing and other lead generation activities operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. However, we cannot ensure that the FTC, CFPB, FCC, other governmental bodies, state attorneys general, state agencies or private litigants will not take the position that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or that they will not attempt to hold us responsible for any unlawful acts conducted by our advertisers, third party partners, or third party vendors. It may also not be possible to successfully enforce or collect upon any indemnities provided to us by third parties. Penalties for failure to comply with certain of these statutes and regulations can become material quickly. For example, under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek injunctive relief and actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations.\nCertain states have enacted, or are considering enacting, legislation that places limitations and requirements on businesses that provide referrals for senior housing. Such legislation could make the provision of our senior care services more expensive and less profitable, or prohibit the operation of those services, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Federal and state fraud and abuse laws could be applied to senior care referral sources where referral fees are funded using government funds resulting in significant liability.\nWe believe that we have structured our business and our online services to comply with applicable laws and regulations as are currently in effect. Because of uncertainties as to the applicability of some of these laws and regulations to online services and, more specifically, to our type of business, and considering that our business has evolved and expanded in a relatively short period of time, and will continue to evolve and develop, we may not always have been, and may not always be, in compliance with all applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to administrative enforcement actions and fines, class action lawsuits, cease and desist orders, and civil and criminal liability. In addition, we could face the revocation of or inability to renew required licenses or registrations, and our advertisers and other business partners could terminate their commercial relationships with us. Liabilities resulting from our failure, or alleged failure, to comply with applicable laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, if applicable laws and regulations are changed or interpreted differently, or if new laws or regulations are enacted, these events could prohibit or substantially alter the content we provide on our websites and the operation of our business, and could result in our advertisers or other business partners ceasing or reducing the business they do with us. These events could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in general economic conditions and changes in market conditions may adversely affect the financial services industry and harm our revenue opportunities, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral shifts in economic trends, reduced availability of commercial credit and increasing unemployment negatively impact the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy in the past have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other. These macroeconomic conditions have affected and may in the future negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Economic pressure on consumers and businesses and declining confidence in the financial markets would likely cause a decrease in the demand for advertising financial products and services. Additionally, advertising expenditures tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Since we derive most of our revenues from advertising, changes in economic conditions could cause decreases in or delays in advertising spending and would be likely to reduce our revenue and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nRestrictive covenants in the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes, our revolving credit facility or other future indebtedness may limit our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe Indenture, dated as of August 7, 2013 (the \u201cSenior Notes Indenture\u201d), governing our 6.125% senior notes due 2018 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and our $70.0 million revolving facility (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) contain, and any future indebtedness may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest. The Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility limit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments (including redemptions of subordinated indebtedness);\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u00b7\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u00b7\nmerge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nmake investments; and\n\u00b7\nchange our business operations.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility or any agreement governing our future indebtedness could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our lenders and note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.\nThe restrictions contained in the Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u00b7\nfinance our operations;\n\u00b7\nmake needed or desired capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nmake strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic alliances;\n\u00b7\nwithstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u00b7\nengage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and\n\u00b7\nplan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nThese restrictions could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe have, and will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was $295.7 million, net of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs comprised of the Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had no loans outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our interest expense, including the amortization of original issue discount and deferred financing costs, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $21.5 million. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to invest in our business at an appropriate level, thereby making it more difficult to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have other important consequences to you and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to other contractual and commercial commitments;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u00b7\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, changes in government regulation and changes in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to, changing conditions;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u00b7\nexpose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of increases in interest rates; and\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on the Senior Notes and amounts outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn addition, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility each contain, and the agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful or if successful, could adversely impact our business.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Our debt service obligations are currently $18.6 million per year. In addition, if our Revolving Credit Facility is drawn in the future it would increase the amount of our current debt service obligations. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility each restrict, and any of our other future debt agreements may restrict, our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which may not be guarantors of the Senior Notes or guarantors of our other indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the Senior Notes, our obligations from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility or any future indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Senior Notes or under the Revolving Credit Facility or to make funds available for such purposes. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Although the Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility do, and other future debt agreements may, limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are, or in the case of future debt agreements may be, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, holders of Senior Notes or our other indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDespite restrictions in the Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, we may still be able to incur additional indebtedness. This could increase the risks associated with our leverage, including the ability to service our indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur additional indebtedness pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility in the future, including additional secured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, we were able to incur up to an additional $330.6 million of indebtedness, of which up to $100.0 million could be secured indebtedness, pursuant to the incurrence tests described in the Senior Notes Indenture and Revolving Credit Facility. Although covenants under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility limit our ability and the ability of our present and future subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility also allow us to incur certain additional secured and unsecured debt and allow our foreign restricted subsidiaries and our future unrestricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt, which would be structurally senior to the Senior Notes and amounts outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility do not prohibit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined therein. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risk associated with substantial additional indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt will increase.\nWe may not receive some or all of the purchase price in connection with the sale of our Insurance business, which could adversely affect our operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Equity Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with All Web Leads, Inc. provides that $25.0 million of the $165.0 million aggregate purchase price payable to us as consideration for the sale of our Insurance business to All Web Leads will be paid on the second anniversary of the closing date. Following the adjustment for closing working capital, that deferred consideration was reduced to $23.1 million. If All Web Leads is unable to pay the deferred payment amount in full on or before the second anniversary of the closing date as a result of restrictions under its Revolving Credit Facility, All Web Leads will pay us as much of the deferred payment amount as is permitted under its Revolving Credit Facility and deliver to us a subordinated promissory note in a principal amount equal to the unpaid portion of the deferred payment amount plus interest accrued at one-year LIBOR plus 8.0% per annum from the date of closing on such unpaid portion. The subordinated promissory note will have an interest rate of one-year LIBOR plus 8.0% per annum and will mature on the date that is six months after the maturity date of All Web Leads\u2019 credit facility. Both the deferred compensation payable under the Purchase Agreement and the obligations under promissory note, if it is issued in lieu of cash payment, will be subordinated to All Web Leads\u2019 senior indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nWe have no assurance that All Web Leads can or will perform its payment and other obligations with respect to the deferred compensation payable under the Purchase Agreement or under the promissory note, if it is issued in lieu of cash payment. If All Web Leads is unable to perform its obligations with respect to the deferred compensation payable under the Purchase Agreement or under the promissory note, if it is issued in lieu of cash payment, our receipt of the full amount of the deferred compensation payable under the Purchase Agreement may be delayed or may not be collectible at all. Additionally, we may incur significant legal fees in pursuing collection of the deferred compensation payable under the Purchase Agreement or under the promissory note, if it is issued in lieu of cash payment. Any such delay, additional costs, loss or nonpayment could adversely affect our ability to fund our remaining operations.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to our 2014 Restatement and Other Accounting Issues\nThe Company is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the DOJ. The DOJ investigation and its outcome could adversely affect the Company, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses (including settlement costs) or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nThe Company is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the DOJ, which is related to our amendment and restatement of our consolidated financial statements and other financial information (the \u201cRestatement\u201d). We could be subject to fines, settlement costs, penalties, or other sanctions as a result of this investigation. It is not possible to predict when the DOJ investigation will be completed, the final outcome of the investigation, and what if any actions may be taken by the DOJ.\n\ufeff\nOur indemnification obligations and advancement and reimbursement of expenses, and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance, could result in significant legal expenses or damages and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nCertain of our former employees have been sued by the SEC for alleged violations of the securities laws relating to accounting issues referenced above and may become defendants in future proceedings relating to such matters. Under Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and certain indemnification agreements, we may have indemnification obligations to these former employees in relation to these matters, and are advancing legal expenses to these former employees. These indemnity obligations and expense advancements have resulted and may continue to result in significant legal expenses or damages and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow to suffer. The former employees receiving expense advancement are obligated to reimburse us under certain circumstances. Those circumstances may not occur, however, or the individuals may refuse or be unable to provide such reimbursement.\nWhile we maintain director and officer liability insurance, following the insurance funding of the class action settlement described in Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements in this report we have exhausted the coverage available to us for the policy year applicable to the class action lawsuit and the SEC and DOJ investigations. As a result, further expenses or liabilities related to these matters, including indemnification and expense advancement obligations, will be borne by us and could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nThe DOJ investigation and the settled SEC investigation, and other issues in connection with the Restatement could have an adverse impact on our business relationships.\nOur operations and business rely on our reputation with consumers and relationships with our advertisers, co-brand partners, distribution partners, print partners and other business partners. The DOJ investigation and settled SEC investigation, and other issues in connection with the Restatement, could have an adverse impact on our business relationships with our partners. Among other outcomes, these partners may seek out new partners or rely on their other partners more heavily, and reduce or potentially become unwilling to do business with us, causing our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Shares of Our Securities\nThe Apax Holders (defined below) control a significant interest in us and their interests may conflict with or differ from stockholder interests.\nTo our knowledge, Ben Holding S.\u00e0 r.l., which is beneficially owned by Apax US VII, L.P., Apax Europe VII-A, L.P., Apax Europe VII-B, L.P. and Apax Europe VII-1, L.P. (the \u201cApax Holders\u201d), currently owns approximately 41.9% of our common stock. As a result of its ownership, the Apax Holders have the power, and pursuant to the stockholders agreement, their majority-owned subsidiary Ben Holding S.\u00e0 r.l. has the contractual right, to nominate a number of directors equal to 30% of the total number of directors. Accordingly, the Apax Holders have significant influence over any decision to approve or reject any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or our stockholders, including significant corporate transactions such as business combinations. In addition, following a reduction of the equity owned by the Apax Holders to below 30% of our outstanding common stock, the Apax Holders, through Ben Holding S.\u00e0 r.l., will retain the right to designate a certain number of designees for our board of directors until the Apax Holders\u2019 ownership percentage falls below 5%. The Apax Holders\u2019 ability to significantly influence our decisions will continue even after selling a portion of their interests in us.\nThe interests of the Apax Holders could conflict with or differ from other stockholder interests. For example, the concentration of ownership held by the Apax Holders could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the Company or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that other stockholders may otherwise support, or approve such transactions notwithstanding opposition from other stockholders. Additionally, Apax Partners is in the business of advising on investments in companies the Apax Holders hold, and they or other funds advised by Apax Partners may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. They may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 86895, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "RATE"}
