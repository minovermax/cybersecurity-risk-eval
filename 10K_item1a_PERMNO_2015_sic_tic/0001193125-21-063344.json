{"cik": "729986", "company": "UNITED BANKSHARES INC/WV", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nUnited is subject to risks inherent to the Company\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair United\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19\nPANDEMIC\nUnited\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe ongoing COVID-19\npandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, United\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic will continue to negatively affect United\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of United\u2019s business continuity plan, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on United\u2019s employees, customers, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19\npandemic has contributed to:\n\u2022\nIncreased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence and business generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures.\n\u2022\nRatings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries, including natural resources, hospitality, transportation and commercial real estate.\n\u2022\nA sudden and significant reduction in the valuation of the equity, fixed-income and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities, which may lead to decreased net interest income.\n\u2022\nIncreased demands on capital and liquidity.\n\u2022\nA reduction in the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others, affecting related fee income and demand for the Company\u2019s services.\n\u2022\nHeightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements.\nGovernmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on United\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. United also faces an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19\non market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.\nThe length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown. Until the pandemic subsides, the Company expects continued draws on lines of credit, reduced revenues in our trust operations and other businesses and increased customer and client defaults, including defaults in unsecured loans.\nEven after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may experience a recession, and United anticipates the Company\u2019s businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession.\nAs a participating lender in the PPP, United and United Bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from United Bank\u2019s customers or other parties regarding United Bank\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees.\nUnder the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. United Bank is participating as a lender in the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes United and United Bank to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. In addition, United Bank\u2019s participation in the PPP as a lender may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and results of operations depending on the timing and amount of forgiveness, if any, to which borrowers are entitled.\nSince the opening of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP and claims related to agent fees. United and United Bank may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers\nthat approached United Bank regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP, or litigation from agents with respect to agent fees. If any such litigation is filed against United or United Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to United or United Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect their reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnited Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by United Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a\nPPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by United Bank, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from United Bank. Additionally, if a borrower under the PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, United Bank is at the heightened risk of holding the loan at an unfavorable interest rate as compared to loans to customers that United Bank would have otherwise extended credit. Rules providing for forgiveness have been constantly evolving, including an automatic forgiveness if the amount of the PPP loan was not larger than a specified floor.\nCREDIT RISKS\nThere are no assurances as to adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.\nThe FASB\u2019s Accounting Standards Update 2016-13,\neffective for United as of January 1, 2020, substantially changes the accounting for credit losses on loans, leases and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The new standard requires the recognition of credit losses on loans, leases and other financial assets based on an entity\u2019s current estimate of expected losses over the lifetime of each loan, lease or other financial asset, referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model as opposed to the previous \u201cincurred loss\u201d model, which required recognition of losses on loans, leases and other financial assets only when those losses had incurred. Under the CECL model, United is required to present these certain financial assets, carried at amortized cost, at the net amount expected to be collected over the life of the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including credit quality, our historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts that may affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time a financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and at least quarterly thereafter.\nCECL also requires management judgment that is supported by new models and more data elements, including macroeconomic forecasts, than the previous allowance standard. This is expected to increase the complexity and associated risk, particularly in times of economic uncertainty or other unforeseen circumstances, which could impact United\u2019s results of operations and capital levels as well as place stress on our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators, as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions, periodically review United\u2019s allowance for credit losses on loans, and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Any increases in the allowance for credit losses on loans will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the section captioned \u201cProvision for Credit Losses\u201d in in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K\nfor further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses.\nUnited is subject to credit risk in its loan portfolio, which risk is increasing as result of the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral. United seeks to mitigate the risk inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to prudent loan approval practices. Although United believes that its loan approval criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans the Company makes, United may incur losses on loans that meet our loan approval criteria. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation or deflation, recession, unemployment, changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, acts of terrorism, or other factors beyond our control could cause our borrowers to default on their loan payments, and the collateral values securing such loans to decline and be insufficient to repay any outstanding indebtedness. In such events, we could experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs the overall economic climate in the U.S., generally, and in our market areas specifically, experience material disruption due to the COVID-19\npandemic, our borrowers may have difficulties in repaying their loans. Governmental actions providing payment relief to borrowers affected by COVID-19\ncould preclude our ability to initiate foreclosure proceedings in certain circumstances and, as a result, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of our nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for credit losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of certain commercial real estate and multifamily residential loans include the duration of state and local moratoriums on evictions for non-payment\nof rent or other fees. The payment on these loans that are secured by income producing properties are typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate property and may subject us to risks from adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy.\nBank regulatory agencies and various governmental authorities are urging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19.\nWe are actively working to support our borrowers to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on them and on our loan portfolio, including through loan modifications that defer payments for those who experienced a hardship as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. Although recent regulatory guidance provides that such loan modifications are exempt from the calculation and reporting of troubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and loan delinquencies, we cannot predict whether such loan modifications may ultimately have an adverse impact on our profitability in future periods. Our inability to successfully manage the increased credit risk caused by the COVID-19\npandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nUnited\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nUnited relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. In addition, as part of its business, United collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential client and customer information. United\u2019s facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While United has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Company\u2019s information systems could damage United\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject United to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a cyber-attack, other breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm our business.\nIn the normal course of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on our behalf and on behalf of other third parties. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and / or human errors, or other similar events.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, employees working from home and the increased sophistication and\nactivities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, designed to disrupt key business services such as customer-facing web sites. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types. Although we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, early detection may be thwarted by persistent sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.\nWe also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. We also rely on numerous other third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them. While we conduct security assessments on our higher risk third parties, we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nAny cyber-attack or other security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information could severely damage our reputation, erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnited\u2019s business continuity plans or data security systems could prove to be inadequate, resulting in a material interruption in, or disruption to, its business and a negative impact on results of operations.\nUnited relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems, whether due to severe weather, natural disasters, cyber-attack, acts of war or terrorism, criminal activity or other factors, could result in failures or disruptions in general ledger, deposit, loan, customer relationship management and other systems. While United has disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of United\u2019s information systems could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nThe negative economic effects caused by terrorist attacks, including cyber-attacks, potential attacks and other destabilizing events would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of United\u2019s loan portfolio and could reduce its customer base, level of deposits, and demand for its financial products such as loans.\nHigh inflation, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, including cyber-attacks, an escalation of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, and other factors could have a negative impact on the economy of the Mid-Atlantic\nand Southeast regions in which United operates. An additional economic downturn in its markets would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of United\u2019s loan portfolio by impacting the ability of its customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and may reduce the level of deposits in its bank and the stability of its deposit funding sources. An additional economic downturn could also have a significant impact on the demand for United\u2019s products and services. The cumulative effect of these matters on United\u2019s results of operations and financial condition would likely be adverse and material.\nLoss of United\u2019s Chief Executive Officer or other executive officers could adversely affect its business.\nUnited\u2019s success is dependent upon the continued service and skills of its executive officers and senior management. If United loses the services of these key personnel, it could have a negative impact on United\u2019s\nbusiness because of their skills, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. The services of Richard M. Adams, United\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, would be particularly difficult to replace. United and Mr. Adams are parties to an Employment Agreement providing for his continued employment by United through March 31, 2024.\nUnited\u2019s vendors could fail to fulfill their contractual obligations, resulting in a material interruption in, or disruption to, its business and a negative impact on results of operations.\nUnited is dependent upon third parties for certain information system, data management and processing services and to provide key components of its business infrastructure. United has entered into subcontracts for the supply of current and future services, such as data processing, mortgage loan processing and servicing, and certain property management functions. These services must be available on a continuous and timely basis and be in compliance with any regulatory requirements. Failure to do so could substantially harm United\u2019s business.\nUnited often purchases services from vendors under agreements that typically can be terminated on a periodic basis. There can be no assurance, however, that vendors will be able to meet their obligations under these agreements or that United will be able to compel them to do so. Risks of relying on vendors include the following:\n\u2022\nIf an existing agreement expires or a certain service is discontinued by a vendor, then United may not be able to continue to offer its customers the same breadth of products and its operating results would likely suffer unless it is able to find an alternate supply of a similar service.\n\u2022\nAgreements United may negotiate in the future may commit it to certain minimum spending obligations. It is possible United will not be able to create the market demand to meet such obligations.\n\u2022\nIf market demand for United\u2019s products increases suddenly, its current vendors might not be able to fulfill United\u2019s commercial needs, which would require it to seek new arrangements or new sources of supply, and may result in substantial delays in meeting market demand.\n\u2022\nUnited may not be able to control or adequately monitor the quality of services it receives from its vendors. Poor quality services could damage United\u2019s reputation with its customers.\nIn addition, these third party service providers are sources of operational and informational security risk to United, including risks associated with operational errors, information system interruptions or breaches, and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information. If third party service providers encounter any of these issues, or if United has difficulty communicating with them, United could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our business.\nPotential problems with vendors such as those discussed above could have a significant adverse effect on United\u2019s business, lead to higher costs and damage its reputation with its customers and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nMARKET AND INTEREST RATE RISKS\nChanges in economic and political conditions could adversely affect our earnings, as our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans decline\n.\nUnited\u2019s success depends, to a certain extent, upon local and national economic and political conditions, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as an economic recession, rising unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond its control may adversely affect United\u2019s and United Bank\u2019s asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, its earnings. Because United has a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which could have an adverse impact on our earnings. Consequently, declines in the economy in our market area could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines in value could have a materially adverse effect on future earnings and regulatory capital.\nContinued volatility in the fair value for certain investment securities, whether caused by changes in market conditions, interest rates, credit risk of the issuer, the expected yield of the security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could result in significant fluctuations in the value of the securities as well as any regulatory rulemaking such as the Volcker Rule which could exclude or limit the holdings of certain investment securities. This could have a material adverse impact on United\u2019s accumulated other comprehensive income and shareholders\u2019 equity depending on the direction of the fluctuations. Furthermore, future downgrades, defaults or prepayments, including the liquidation of the underlying collateral in certain securities, could result in the recording of an allowance for credit losses related to these securities. This could have a material impact on United\u2019s future earnings, although the impact on shareholders\u2019 equity will be offset by any amount already included in other comprehensive income.\nUnited operates in a highly competitive market.\nUnited faces a high degree of competition in all of the markets it serves. United faces strong competition in gathering deposits, making loans and obtaining client assets for management by its investment or trust operations. United considers all of West Virginia to be included in its market area. This area includes the five largest West Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Areas (\u201cMSA\u201d): the Parkersburg MSA, the Charleston MSA, the Huntington MSA, the Morgantown MSA and the Wheeling MSA. United serves the Ohio counties of Lawrence, Belmont, Jefferson and Washington and Fayette county in Pennsylvania primarily because of their close proximity to the Ohio and Pennsylvania borders and United banking offices located in those counties or in nearby West Virginia. United\u2019s Virginia markets include the Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. MSA, the Winchester MSA, the Harrisonburg MSA, and the Charlottesville MSA. Through its acquisition of Carolina Financial, United\u2019s market now also includes the Coastal, Midlands, and Upstate regions of South Carolina, including the Charleston (Charleston, Dorchester and Berkeley Counties), Myrtle Beach (Horry and Georgetown Counties), Columbia (Richland and Lexington Counties), and the Upstate (Greenville and Spartanburg Counties) areas as well as areas in North Carolina including Wilmington (New Hanover County), Raleigh-Durham (Durham and Wake Counties), Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia (NC and SC) and the southeastern coastal region of North Carolina (Bladen, Brunswick, Columbus, Cumberland, Duplin and Robeson Counties). United considers all of the above locations to be the primary market area for the business of its banking and mortgage banking subsidiaries.\nThere is a risk that aggressive competition could result in United controlling a smaller share of these markets. A decline in market share could lead to a decline in net income which would have a negative impact on stockholder value.\nUnited may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. United has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, or other institutional clients. Recent defaults by financial services institutions, and even rumors or questions about a financial institution or the financial services industry in general, have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by United or other institutions. Any such losses could adversely affect United\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect United\u2019s business.\nUnited\u2019s earnings, like most financial institutions, are significantly dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income United earns on loans and other assets which earn interest and the interest expense incurred to fund those assets, such as on savings deposits and borrowed money.\nTherefore, changes in general market interest rates, such as a change in the monetary policy of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or otherwise beyond those which are contemplated by United\u2019s interest rate risk model and policy, could have an effect on net interest income. For more information concerning United\u2019s interest rate risk model and policy, see the discussion in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in Part II, under Item 7A of this Form 10-K.\nInterest rates on United\u2019s outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences, which cannot be predicted. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Since then, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fall-back language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\u201cIBA\u201d), the benchmark administrator for the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) LIBOR announced a proposal to extend the publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023. However, banking regulators issued guidance strongly encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, interest rates on our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of LIBOR, announced that it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The outcome of such consultation and its impact on LIBOR could materially affect the economics as well as the timing of the transition away from LIBOR. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates.\nREGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS\nUnited is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.\nUnited is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect United\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth, among other things. These regulations also impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls, among other things, to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identities of United\u2019s customers. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect United in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products United may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. United expends substantial effort and incurs costs to improve its systems, audit capabilities, staffing and training in order to satisfy regulatory requirements, but the regulatory authorities may determine that such efforts are insufficient. Failure to comply with relevant laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nIn the normal course of business, United and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments that the Company has made and the businesses in which United has engaged. Recently, federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in the Company\u2019s favor, they could have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices. Compliance with any such change may impact the business\noperations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including United Bank\n.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The concept of what may be considered to be an \u201cabusive\u201d practice is relatively new under the law. Moreover, United Bank is supervised and examined by the CFPB for compliance with the CFPB\u2019s regulations and policies. The costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory reporting regimen have yet to be fully determined, although they may be material and the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon United Bank with respect to its consumer product offering and services may produce significant, material effects on United Bank (and United\u2019s) profitability.\nUnited is subject to higher regulatory capital requirements and failure to comply with these standards may impact dividend payments, equity repurchases and executive compensation.\nUnited and United Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve Board (the \u201cFRB\u201d). From time to time, the FRB changes these capital adequacy standards. In particular, the capital requirements applicable to United under the Basel III rules became fully effective on January 1, 2019. Under the Basel III rules, United is required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%, a total capital ratio of 8%, and a leverage ratio of 4%. In addition, United must maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of total risk weighted assets.\nBanking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios including the capital conservation buffer will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution\u2019s \u201celigible retained income\u201d (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income).\nThe Basel III changes have resulted in generally higher minimum capital ratios than in the past that requires United and its subsidiaries to maintain capital buffers above minimum requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and executive bonus payments. In addition, the application of more stringent capital requirements for United could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital and result in additional regulatory actions if United were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit United\u2019s ability to make distributions, including paying dividends.\nUnited\u2019s earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies\n.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve impact United significantly. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold. Those policies determine to a significant extent our cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Federal Reserve policies can also affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. For example, a tightening of the money supply by the Federal Reserve could reduce the demand for a borrower\u2019s products and services. This could adversely affect the borrower\u2019s earnings and ability to repay its loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnited may be terminated as a servicer of mortgage loans, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions\n.\nUnited, through its mortgage banking subsidiary, Crescent, acts as servicer for approximately $3.6 billion of mortgage loans owned by third parties as of December 31, 2020. As a servicer for those loans, United has certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales. If United commits a material breach of its obligations as servicer, United may be subject to termination as servicer if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing United to lose servicing income.\nIn some cases, United may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If United has increased repurchase obligations because of claims that United did not satisfy our obligations as a servicer, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, United may have a significant reduction to net servicing income within its mortgage banking noninterest income. United may incur costs if United is required to, or if United elects to, re-execute\nor re-file\ndocuments or take other action in its capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. United may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, United may have liability to the borrower and/or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to United. In addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective, United could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan. United may incur liability to securitization investors relating to delays or deficiencies in its processing of mortgage assignments or other documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosures. The fair value of United\u2019s mortgage servicing rights may be negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure costs. United may be subject to fines and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our foreclosure practices or in the foreclosure practices of other mortgage loan servicers. Any of these actions may harm United\u2019s reputation or negatively affect its home lending or servicing business.\nUnited may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm liquidity, results of operations and financial condition\n.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, United is required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the government sponsored enterprises, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnification of buyers against losses, in the event United breaches these representations or warranties. In addition, United may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. With respect to loans that are originated through United\u2019s broker or correspondent channels, the remedies available against the originating\nbroker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers, guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against United. United faces further risk that the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser, guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against United, it may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of United\u2019s provision for potential losses, its liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP RISKS\nUnited\u2019s stock price can be volatile\n.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for United shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive. United\u2019s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated negative variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nNegative recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nPoor operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to United;\n\u2022\nNews reports relating to negative trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nNegative perceptions in the marketplace regarding United and/or its competitors;\n\u2022\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in interest rates or a lending environment with prolonged low interest rates;\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in the real estate market;\n\u2022\nNegative economic news;\n\u2022\nFailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nAdverse changes in government regulations; and\n\u2022\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause United\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nDividend payments by United\u2019s subsidiaries to United and by United to its shareholders can be restricted.\nThe declaration and payment of future cash dividends will depend on, among other things, United\u2019s earnings, the general economic and regulatory climate, United\u2019s liquidity and capital requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by United\u2019s board of directors. Federal Reserve Board policy limits the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, without regulatory approval, and requires that a holding company serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.\nUnited\u2019s principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common stock is cash dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of these dividends by its subsidiaries is also restricted by federal and state banking laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $94.6 million was available for dividend payments from United Bank to United without regulatory approval.\nAn investment in United common stock is not an insured deposit.\nUnited common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in United common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this section and elsewhere in this prospectus and joint proxy statement and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, someone who acquires United common stock, could lose some or all of their investment.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair United\u2019s ability to accurately and timely report its financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting United\u2019s business and stock price\n.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. Management believes that United\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting are currently effective. Management will continually review and analyze the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting for Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. Any failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal control environment could impact United\u2019s ability to report its financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact United\u2019s business and stock price.\nCertain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult to be acquired by a third party, even if perceived to be beneficial to United\u2019s shareholders. These provisions effectively inhibit a non-negotiated\nmerger or other business combination, which could adversely affect the market price of United\u2019s common stock.\nGENERAL RISKS\nUnited may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but capital may not be available when it is needed.\nUnited is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, United may elect to raise additional capital to support the Company\u2019s business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or United may otherwise elect to raise additional capital. In that regard, a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital as a result of deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market, deteriorating economic conditions, declines in real estate values and other factors, which may diminish United\u2019s ability to raise additional capital.\nUnited\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on United\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, United cannot be assured of its ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If United cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNew accounting or tax pronouncements or interpretations may be issued by the accounting profession, regulators or other government bodies which could change existing accounting methods. Changes in accounting methods could negatively impact United\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrent accounting and tax rules, standards, policies and interpretations influence the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Events that may not have a direct impact on United, such as the bankruptcy of major U.S. companies, have resulted in legislators, regulators and authoritative bodies, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and various taxing authorities, responding by adopting and/or proposing substantive revision to laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting standards may adversely affect reported financial condition and results of operations.\nUnited could face unanticipated environmental liabilities or costs related to real property owned or acquired through foreclosure. Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those related to investigation and clean-up\nof contaminated sites, could have a negative effect on expenses and results of operations.\nA significant portion of United\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, United may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, United may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require United to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit United\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase exposure to environmental liability. Although United has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact United\u2019s ability to conduct business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could affect the stability of United\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, adversely impact United\u2019s employee base, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and / or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on United\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 11369, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "UBSI"}
