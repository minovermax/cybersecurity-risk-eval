If any of the risks described below actually occurs, our business, financial results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. The risks below are categorized by \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business,\u201d \u201cRisks Relating to International Operations,\u201d \u201cRisks Relating to our Recent Material Transactions,\u201d \u201cRisks Relating to Our Operation as an Independent, Publicly Traded Company,\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to Our Common Stock.\u201d Additional risk and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Acquisition by Sierra\nThe announcement and pendency of our proposed Merger with Sierra could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed acquisition of our company by Sierra could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations, regardless of whether the proposed Merger is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the proposed acquisition. We could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. In addition, we have\ndiverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources towards the completion of the transaction, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger as provided in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, certain restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses, sell, transfer or license our assets, amend our organizational documents, and incur indebtedness. These restrictions could result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities and may otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations.\nFailure to complete the proposed Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nThere is no assurance that the closing of the Merger will occur. Consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including, among other things, the absence of certain legal impediments; the expiration or termination of the required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; antitrust regulatory approval in certain other jurisdictions; certain other filings and approvals by governmental authorities in France; and approval by our stockholders. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of these conditions will be satisfied. Although there is not a financing contingency in the Merger Agreement, the Merger could fail if Sierra is unable to obtain the financing for the transaction, in which event we would likely be entitled to the reverse break-up fee. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors or a termination of the Merger Agreement by us to enter into an agreement for a \u201csuperior proposal.\u201d If the Merger is not consummated, our stock price will likely decline as our stock has recently traded based on the proposed per share price for the Merger. We will have incurred significant costs, including, among other things, the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the closing of the Merger does not occur. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price.\nRisk Relating to Our Business\nAlthough we experienced an increase in product bookings during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year, product bookings in the preceding years have decreased significantly. If product bookings do not continue to increase, our revenue, profitability and cash flows will likely be materially adversely affected and we may be required to implement certain measures to preserve or enhance our operating results and cash position.\nWe experienced an increase in product bookings in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. However, in the preceding years, product bookings decreased significantly, continuing an adverse business trend that began in 2008. Although product bookings are expected to increase in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017 (or fiscal 2016), we cannot assure you that we will achieve our targets and product bookings may decrease in fiscal 2016 and in future periods. If product bookings do not continue to increase, our revenue, profitability and cash flows will likely be materially adversely affected and we may be required to implement further cost reduction measures and other initiatives to preserve and enhance our operating results and cash position. Any such measures may limit or hinder our ability to execute our strategy and achieve our objectives, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, declines in customer order activity may result in reduced revenue in future periods and may require us to record non-cash expenses relating to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate customer demand for new products and solutions and to generate revenue from new products and technologies that exceed any declines in revenue we may experience from the sale of traditional products and solutions. Our advanced offerings may not be widely adopted by our existing and potential customers and increases in sales of our advanced offerings, if any, may not exceed or fully offset potential declines in sales of our traditional products and solutions.\nIn response to a rapidly evolving Digital Services market, we are engaged in the promotion of Digital Services advanced offerings, such as IP messaging, WebRTC, IP-SMS-Gateway, security solutions, mobile monetization, enterprise solutions, Rich Communication Solutions (or RCS), and Software as a Service (or SaaS) cloud-based solutions, in addition to our traditional VAS solutions, such as voicemail, SMS and MMS. While we believe demand for advanced offerings may grow due to the increasing deployment of smartphones and rollout of 4G/LTE networks by wireless CSPs, the implementation of a new services model poses challenges with respect to pricing and customer demand for and acceptance of new offerings.\nIt is unclear whether our advanced offerings will be widely adopted by existing and potential customers. Currently, we are unable to predict whether sales of advanced offerings will exceed or fully offset declines that we may experience in the sale of traditional VAS solutions in subsequent fiscal periods. If sales of advanced offerings do not increase or if increases in sales of advanced offerings do not exceed or fully offset any declines in sales of traditional VAS solutions, due to adverse market trends,\nchanges in consumer preferences or otherwise, our revenue, profitability and cash flows would likely be materially adversely affected.\nHistorically, we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from certain major customers, and our revenue, profitability and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or develop relationships with these customers, or if these customers reduce demand for our products.\nHistorically, we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers.\nFor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, one customer accounted for approximately 16%, 17%, and 30% of our revenue, respectively. We intend to establish long-term relationships with existing customers and continue to expand our customer base. While we diligently seek to become less dependent on any single customer, it is likely that one or more customers will continue to contribute a significant portion of our revenue in any given year for the foreseeable future. The loss of one or more of our significant customers, or reduced demand from one or more of our significant customers, would result in an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.\nProduct bookings are difficult to predict as a result of a high percentage of product bookings typically generated late in the fiscal quarter and in the fiscal year, lengthy and variable sales cycles, and a focus on large customers and projects.\nA high percentage of our product bookings has typically been generated late in fiscal quarters. This trend makes it difficult for us to forecast our annual product bookings and to implement effective measures to cover any shortfalls of prior fiscal quarters if product bookings for the fourth fiscal quarter fail to meet our expectations.\nFurthermore, we continue to emphasize large capacity systems in our product development and marketing strategies. Contracts for Digital Services installations typically involve a lengthy, complex and highly competitive bidding and selection process, and our ability to obtain particular contracts is inherently difficult to predict. A delay, cancellation or postponement of significant orders may cause us to miss our projections, which may not be discernible until the end of a financial reporting period.\nIt is difficult for us to forecast the timing of orders because our customers often need a significant amount of time to evaluate products before purchasing them. The period between initial customer contact and a purchase by a customer may vary from a few weeks to more than a year. During the evaluation period, customers may defer or scale down proposed orders of products for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in budgets and purchasing priorities;\n\u2022\nreduced need to upgrade existing systems;\n\u2022\ndeferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products;\n\u2022\nintroduction of products by competitors; and\n\u2022\nlower prices offered by competitors.\nWe have many significant customers and frequently receive multi-million dollar orders. The deferral or loss of one or more significant orders or customers, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future fiscal periods.\nWe base our current and future expense levels on internal operating plans and sales forecasts, and operating costs are, to a large extent, fixed. As a result, we may not be able to sufficiently reduce our operating costs in any period to compensate for an unexpected near-term shortfall in revenue.\nDecline or weakness in the global economy may result in reduced information technology spending and reduced demand for our products and services.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from CSPs. Historically, during times of weakness in the global economy, many of our customers experienced significant declines in revenue and profitability and some customers were required to reduce excessive debt levels. In response to these challenges, many of our customers implemented cost-cutting measures, and more closely managed their operating expenses and capital investment budgets. These responses resulted in reduced demand for our products, services and solutions, longer customer purchasing decisions and pricing pressures that adversely affected our revenue, profitability and cash flow. More specifically, adverse market conditions have had a negative impact on our business by reducing the number of contracts we were able to sign with new customers and the size of initial spending commitments, as well as decreasing the level of discretionary spending under contracts with existing customers. In addition, a slowdown in buying decisions of CSPs has in the past affected, and may affect our business by increasing the risks of credit or business failures of suppliers, customers or distributors, by customer requirements for extended payment terms, by delays and defaults in customer or distributor payments, and by price reductions instituted by competitors to retain or acquire market share. In response to these events we, similar to other companies, engaged in significant cost savings measures.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, the global economy continued to experience a modest recovery but was still subject to significant volatility and uncertainty. If the global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty or market conditions worsen, our existing and potential customers will likely reduce their spending, which, in turn, would reduce the demand for our products and services, and materially affect our business, including our revenue, profitability and cash flows. In addition, we would likely be required to again undertake significant cost-saving measures, which measures may negatively impact our ability to implement our strategies and obtain our objectives, particularly if we are not able to invest in our businesses as a result of a protracted economic downturn.\nConditions in the telecommunications industry have harmed and may continue to harm our business, including our revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nWe have experienced certain adverse conditions in the telecommunications industry, including the emergence of new, lower-cost competitors from emerging markets, continued pressure on both capital expenditure and operating budgets at CSPs due to reduced ARPU, the proliferation of alternative messaging applications and new over-the-top competitors to CSPs, the maturation of wireless services, the commoditization of some voice and SMS text message services, the increased dependence for growth on emerging markets with a lower average revenue per user, customer consolidation and changes in the regulatory environment at times. These conditions have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, including our revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nRestructuring initiatives to align operating costs and expenses with anticipated revenue could have an adverse impact on our product development, project deployment and the timely execution of our business strategy.\nIn recent years we have implemented certain initiatives to improve operating performance and cash flow from operations. We intend to continue to implement these initiatives, which we believe will enhance efficiency and result in significant reductions in costs and operating expenses, including realigning our cost structure to our current size and business environment by primarily reducing our selling, general and administrative expenses. We intend to continue to implement restructuring initiatives during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017 in connection with the sale of the BSS business to Amdocs, the acquisition of Acision and as part of our ongoing review of our operations. While restructuring our operations is designed to improve operational efficiency and business performance, there is a risk that such restructuring could have an adverse impact on our product development, project deployment and the timely execution of our business strategy. In addition, there is no assurance that these initiatives will reduce costs and the costs to implement them may offset any savings for a period of time.\nWe have engaged third parties to perform portions of our business operations, including research and development, project deployment, delivery, maintenance and support functions, and expect to use third parties for additional business operations which may limit our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of our reliance on third-party providers.\nWe use third-party subcontractors, also referred to as third-party providers, primarily for certain research and development, project deployment, delivery, maintenance and support, and general and administrative functions, primarily in India, Israel, China and the United States. As of January 31, 2016, we used approximately 850 independent subcontractors for such functions, including under our master services agreement with Tech Mahindra Limited (or Tech Mahindra). For more information about the agreement with Tech Mahindra, see \u201c\u2212Risks Related to Our Recent Material Transactions.\u201d\nWe use third-party providers to help provide flexibility to our cost structure as well as provide expertise in certain areas where the hiring of some skills in certain geographies may be difficult to obtain. While we utilize several companies to supply subcontractors and other services, we rely on a few for a large portion of these functions. For example, we expect to be dependent on Tech Mahindra for the provision of services related to our Digital Services business. To the extent we do not properly manage or supervise our third-party providers, or where we cannot find an adequate number of qualified third-party providers, we may experience delays and quality issues and ultimately cost overruns and losses on projects. In addition, any disputes or other interruptions in our relationships with such third-party providers may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, as we rely on third-party providers for more of our business operations, we are not able to directly control these activities. Our third-party providers may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of quality, performance, service, cost reductions or other metrics. Failure to meet key performance indicators may result in our being in default with our customers. In addition, we may rely on our third-party providers to secure materials from our suppliers with whom our third-party providers may not have existing relationships and we may be required to continue to manage these relationships even after we engage third-party providers to perform certain business operations.\nAs we engage third-party providers for business operations we become dependent on the IT systems of our third-party providers, including to transmit demand and purchase orders to suppliers, which can result in a delay in order placement. In addition, in an effort to reduce costs and limit their liabilities, our third-party providers may not have robust systems or make commitments in as timely a manner as we require.\nIn some cases the actions of our third-party providers may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations like import or export regulations. As many of our third-party providers operate outside of the U.S., our activity through third-party providers exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks. In addition, we are exposed to the financial viability of our third-party providers. Once a business activity is transitioned to a third-party provider we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within our company or move it to another third-party provider. The actions of our third-party providers could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur success depends on our ability to implement strategies for achieving growth by enhancing our existing products and developing and marketing new products in response to rapidly changing technology in our industries.\nThe software and high technology industry is subject to rapid change. The introduction of new technologies and new alternatives for the delivery of services are having, and can be expected to continue to have, a profound effect on competitive conditions in the market and our success. We have executed strategies to capitalize on growth opportunities in new and emerging products and technologies to offset such pressures. While certain of these new products and technologies have proven to initially be successful, it is unclear whether they will be widely adopted by our customers and potential customers. Any increases in revenue from these new products and technologies may not, however, exceed any declines in revenue we may experience from the sale of traditional products and technologies and our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to correctly anticipate technological trends, to react quickly and effectively to such trends and to enhance our existing products accordingly. Our success also depends, in part, on the development and introduction of new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, the acceptance of these new products by customers and consumers, and the corresponding risks associated with the development, marketing and adoption of these new products. As a result, the life cycle of our products is difficult to estimate. New product offerings may not enter the market in a timely manner for their acceptance or may not properly integrate into existing platforms. The failure of new product offerings to be accepted by the market could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected in the event that our customers reduce our actual and planned expenditures to expand or replace equipment or if we delay and reduce the deployment of new products.\nChanging industry and market conditions may dictate strategic decisions to restructure some business units and discontinue others. Discontinuing a business unit or a product line may require us to record accrued liabilities for restructuring expenses. These strategic decisions could result in changes to determinations regarding a product's useful life and the recoverability of the carrying basis of certain assets.\nWe must often establish and demonstrate the benefits of new and innovative products to customers.\nMany of our new and innovative products are complex. In many cases, it is necessary for us to educate existing and potential customers about the benefits and value of such new and innovative products, with no assurance that the customer will ultimately purchase them. The need to educate our customers increases the difficulty and time necessary to complete transactions, makes it more difficult to efficiently deploy limited resources, and creates risk that we will have invested in an opportunity that ultimately does not come to fruition. If we are unable to establish and demonstrate to customers the benefits and value of our new and innovative products and convert these efforts into sales, our business, including our revenue, profitability and cash flows, will be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the sale of large systems and large system installations.\nWe have historically derived a significant portion of our sales and operating profit from contracts for large system installations with major customers. We continue to emphasize large capacity systems in our product development and marketing strategies. Contracts for large capacity system installations typically involve a lengthy, complex and highly competitive bidding and selection process, and our ability to obtain particular contracts is inherently difficult to predict. The timing and scope of these opportunities and the pricing and margins associated with any eventual contract award are difficult to forecast, and may vary substantially from transaction to transaction. As a result, our future operating results may exhibit a high degree of volatility and may vary significantly from period to period. The degree of our dependence on large system orders, and the investment required to enable us to perform such orders, without assurance of continuing order flow from the same customers, increases the risk associated with our business. Furthermore, if our professional services employees do not provide installation services\neffectively and efficiently, our customers may not use our installation services or may stop using our software. This could adversely impact our revenue and harm our reputation.\nWe may incur significant fees, penalties and costs in respect of undetected defects, errors or operational problems in our complex products.\nOur products are complex and involve sophisticated technology that performs critical functions to highly demanding standards. Our existing and future products may develop operational problems and we may incur fees and penalties in connection with such problems. In addition, when we introduce products to the market or as we release new versions of existing products, the products may contain undetected defects or errors. We may not discover such defects, errors or other operational problems until after products have been released and used by the customer. We may incur significant costs to correct undetected defects, errors or operational problems in our products, including product liability claims. In addition, defects or errors in products also may result in questions regarding the integrity of the products, which could cause adverse publicity and impair their market acceptance, resulting in lost future sales.\nIf our products fail to function as promised, we may be subject to claims for substantial damages. Courts may not enforce provisions in contracts that would limit our liabilities or otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover claims against us. In addition, our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claim. If claims exceeding the available insurance coverage are successfully asserted against us, or our insurers impose premium increases, large deductibles or co-insurance requirements, our business, including our cash position and profitability, could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for certain components and are exposed to the risk that these suppliers and manufacturers will not be able to fill our orders on a timely basis and at the specifications we require.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for specific components and third-party software and may not be able to find alternate manufacturers or third-party software providers that meet our requirements. Existing or alternative sources may not be available on favorable terms and conditions, or at all. Thus, if there is a shortage of supply for these components or third-party software, we may experience an interruption in our product supply.\nIncreased competition could force us to lower our prices or take other actions to differentiate our products and changes in the competitive environment in the telecommunications industry worldwide could seriously affect our business.\nOur competitors may be able to develop more quickly or adapt faster to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. Some of our competitors have, relative to us, greater name recognition and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer service, public relations, distribution and other resources. We also experience competition from significantly larger network providers who, as a result of their size, may be able to put pressure on prices. Certain Asian competitors have cost structures and financing alternatives that allow them in certain locations to also put pressure on prices. In addition, our competitors that manufacture other network telecommunications equipment may derive a competitive advantage in selling systems to customers that are purchasing, or have previously purchased, other compatible network equipment from such manufacturers. Furthermore, due to competition and market trends we expect to provide an increased portion of our solutions as SaaS, which is expected to create further pricing pressures. In addition, some of our customers may in the future decide to develop their own solutions internally instead of purchasing them from us. Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or take other actions to differentiate our products.\nIn addition, the telecommunications industry in which we operate continues to undergo significant changes as a result of deregulation and privatization worldwide, reduced restrictions on competition in the industry and rapid and evolving technologies. The worldwide enhanced services industry is already highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify. In addition, as we enter new markets as a result of our own research and development efforts, acquisitions or changes in subscriber preferences, we are likely to encounter new competitors. Moreover, we face indirect competition from changing and evolving technology, which provides alternatives to our products and services. For example, the introduction of open access to web-based applications from wireless devices allows end users to utilize web-based services, such as Facebook, FaceTime, Google, WhatsApp, Line or Skype, to access, among other things, IP communications free of charge rather than use similar services provided by CSPs. This may reduce demand and the price of our products and services.\nOur compliance with telecommunications regulations and standards may be time-consuming, difficult and costly.\nIn order to maintain market acceptance, our products must continue to meet a significant number of regulations and standards. In the United States, our products must comply with various regulations defined by the Federal Communications\nCommission (or the FCC), as well as national and international standards. Internationally, our products must comply with standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries as well as with recommendations of the International Telecommunications Union. As these standards evolve and if new standards are implemented, we will be required to modify our products or develop and support new versions of our products, and this may negatively affect the sales of our products and increase our costs. The failure of our products to comply, or delays in compliance, with the various existing and evolving industry standards could prevent or delay introduction of our products, which could harm our business.\nGovernment regulatory policies are likely to continue to have an impact on product development costs and project spending costs and accordingly, on the pricing of existing as well as new public network services and, therefore, are expected to affect demand for such services and the communications products, including our products, which support these services. Tariff rates, the rates charged by service providers to their customers, whether determined by service providers or in response to regulatory directives, may affect the cost effectiveness of deploying and promoting certain public network services. Tariff policies are under continuous review and are subject to change. Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or the application of tariff requirements to additional services could adversely affect the sales of our products to certain customers.\nThere may be future changes in U.S. and international telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers' network infrastructure and materially adversely affect our business. User uncertainty regarding future policies may also affect demand for communications products, including our products. In addition, the convergence of circuit and packet networks could be subject to governmental regulation. Currently, few laws or regulations apply to the Internet and to matters such as voice over the Internet. Regulatory initiatives in this area could decrease demand for our products and increase the cost of our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.\nEnvironmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\nOur operations are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, labor and health and safety matters, including disclosure of the use of certain \u201cconflict minerals.\u201d Management believes that our business is operated in material compliance with all such regulations. However, violations may occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes, and any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a reporting company, we are required to comply with rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that require disclosure of the use of conflict minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products, particularly if the number of suppliers offering the minerals identified as conflict minerals sourced from locations other than the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries is limited.\nTo date, the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our expenditures, earnings or competitive position or that of our subsidiaries. We cannot, however, predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by us and could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information or those of our third-party providers, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in our data centers and on our networks, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business providers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. Further, we are dependent, in certain instances, upon our third-party providers and other third parties to adequately protect our sensitive data. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems or those of our third-party providers or other third parties and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential business information. In addition, an associate, contractor, or other third-party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Any such compromise of\nour data security and access or those of our third-party providers or other third parties with whom we may do business, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers\u2019 willingness to transact business with us, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, because we engage third-party providers for certain business operations, we are dependent on our third-party providers to protect certain of our sensitive data. Due to these relationships, the \u201cattack surface\u201d for us to protect against unauthorized access to such data is often extended to our third-party business providers and other third parties, and we may be dependent upon their cyber security capabilities as well as their willingness to exchange threat and response information with us.\nAlthough we have historically experienced actual or attempted breaches of our computer systems and none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation, there can be no assurance such will be the case in the future.\nFailure or delay by us to achieve interoperability of our products with the systems of our customers could impair our ability to sell our products.\nIn order to penetrate new target markets, it is important that we ensure the interoperability of our products with the operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning systems used by our customers. Failure or delay in achieving such interoperability could impair our ability to sell products to some segments of the communications market and would adversely affect our business, including our revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nMany of our sales are made by competitive bid or other competitive process which often require us to expend significant resources with no guaranty of recoupment.\nMany of our sales, particularly in larger installations, are made by competitive bid or other competitive process. Successfully competing in competitive bidding situations subjects us to risks associated with:\n\u2022\nthe frequent need to bid on programs in advance of the completion of our design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns;\n\u2022\nincurring research and development expenses to improve or refine products in advance of winning the bid; and\n\u2022\nthe substantial time, money, and effort, including design, development, and marketing activities, required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us.\nIf we do not ultimately win a bid, we may obtain little or no benefit from these expenditures and may not be able to recoup them on future projects.\nEven where we are not involved in a competitive bidding process, due to the intense competition in our markets and increasing customer demand for shorter delivery periods, we must, in some cases, begin implementation of a project before the corresponding order has been finalized, increasing the risk that we will have to write off expenses associated with pursuing opportunities that ultimately do not come to fruition.\nIn addition, we sell certain products as components in large bids submitted by third parties, including systems integrators. These third parties may not be able to win these bids for reasons unrelated to our products. Accordingly, we may lose potential business, which may be significant, for reasons beyond our control.\nThird parties may infringe upon our proprietary technology and we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark law and contractual non-disclosure and other provisions to protect our technology. These measures may not be sufficient to protect proprietary rights, and third parties may misappropriate our technologies and use for their own benefit. Also, most of these protections do not preclude competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features substantially equivalent or superior to our software. Any failure to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we regularly file patent applications, patents may not be issued on the basis of such applications and, if such patents are issued, they may not be sufficient to protect our technologies. In addition, any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technologies. Effectively policing the unauthorized use of our products is time-consuming and costly, and the steps taken by us may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies, particularly in foreign countries where in many instances the local laws or legal systems do not offer the same level of protection as in the United States.\nIf others claim that certain of our products infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be forced to seek expensive licenses, reengineer our products, engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation or stop marketing those products. We have been party to patent litigations. We attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development efforts. There are many issued patents as well as patent applications in the fields in which we are engaged. Because patent applications in the United States are not publicly disclosed until published or issued, applications may have been filed which relate to our software and products. If we were to discover that our products violated or potentially violated third-party proprietary rights, we might not be able to continue offering these products without obtaining licenses for those products or without substantial reengineering of the products. Any reengineering effort may not be successful and such licenses may not be available. Even if such licenses were available, they may not be offered to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nSubstantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in technology related industries, and our products may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of software products in different industry segments overlaps. In addition, we agreed to indemnify certain customers in certain situations should it be determined that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties and have received certain requests for indemnification from customers. Any third-party infringement claims could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, cause product and service delays or may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Any royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. A successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, including profitability and cash flows.\nUse of free or open source software could expose our products to unintended consequences, including causing code that we develop to become publicly available, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nSome of our products contain free or open source software, referred to collectively as \u201copen source software,\u201d and we anticipate we will make additional use of open source software in the future. Open source software is generally covered by license agreements that permit the user to use, copy, modify and distribute the software without cost, provided that the licensee abides by certain licensing requirements. For example, some open source software license agreements permit the licensee to distribute a derivative work (e.g., a combination of the open source software with other software), but only if the user makes the source code for the entire derivative works available to recipients of the derivative work. If we were required to make any of its proprietary source code available under an open source license, our customers, system integrators and others could have the right to maintain, modify and/or use such code without payment of any license, maintenance or other fees. In recent periods, we have taken steps to mitigate this risk; however, products delivered in the past are subject to greater exposure to open source licensing issues. Furthermore, the developers of open source software generally provide no warranties on such software, which exposes us to greater risk than if we had incorporated third-party commercial software into our products instead of open source software.\nCertain contractual obligations could expose us to uncapped or other significant liabilities.\nCertain contract provisions, principally confidentiality and indemnification obligations in certain of our license agreements, could expose us to risks of significant loss that, in some cases, are not limited by contract to a specified maximum amount. Even where we are able to negotiate limitation of liability provisions, these provisions may not always be enforced depending on the facts and circumstances of the case at hand. If we or our products fail to perform to the standards required by our contracts, we could be subject to uncapped or other significant liability for which we may or may not have adequate insurance and our business, financial condition and results of operations, including cash position and profitability, could be materially adversely affected.\nWe recently completed the acquisition of Acision and may continue to pursue mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments that present risks and may not be successful.\nWe have made acquisitions in the past and continue to examine opportunities for growth through mergers and acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions entail a number of risks including:\n\u2022\nthe impact of the assumption of known potential liabilities or unknown liabilities associated with the merged or acquired companies;\n\u2022\nfinancing the acquisition through the use of cash reserves, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity securities, which may be dilutive to our existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of assimilating the operations, personnel and customers of the acquired companies into our operations and business;\n\u2022\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of achieving the anticipated synergies from the combined businesses, including marketing, product integration, sales and distribution, product development and other synergies;\n\u2022\nthe failure to successfully develop acquired technology, resulting in the impairment of amounts capitalized as intangible assets at the date of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe potential for patent, trademark and other intellectual property infringement claims against the acquired company;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with customers and partners of the acquired companies or our customers and partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with employees of the acquired companies or our employees as a result of integration of new management personnel;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating the acquired company's accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems into existing administrative, financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, particularly in the case of large acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe need to implement required controls, procedures and policies at private companies which, prior to acquisition, lacked such controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, uncertainty regarding the impact of foreign laws and regulations, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries and the difficulty integrating operations and systems as a result of language, cultural, systems, accounting principles and operational differences;\n\u2022\nthe potential inheritance of the acquired companies' past financial statements with their associated risks; and\n\u2022\nthe potential need to write-down impaired goodwill associated with any such transaction in subsequent periods, resulting in expenses to operations.\nWe continue to make significant investments in our business and to examine opportunities for growth. These activities may involve significant expenditures and obligations that cannot readily be curtailed or reduced if anticipated demand for the associated products does not materialize or is delayed. The impact of these decisions on future financial results cannot be predicted with assurance, and our commitment to growth may increase our vulnerability to downturns in our markets, technology changes and shifts in competitive conditions.\nWe are dependent upon hiring and retaining highly qualified employees.\nWe believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified employees, including sales, technical and managerial personnel. Competition for highly qualified employees in our industry is significant. We believe that there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills to serve in many of our key positions and it is difficult to hire and retain those individuals. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees may have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new products and enhancements for existing products and to successfully market and sell those products.\nWe face certain risks associated with potential labor disruptions.\nOur employees based in certain countries, including Israel, France, Germany, Italy and Brazil, are represented by a representative organization and works councils, as applicable (referred to collectively as unions).\nWe conduct discussions with the unions on various matters. In August 2015, The Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel), the representative organization of our employees in Israel, following certain discussions with us, declared a labor dispute which was ultimately resolved and did not lead to a strike. However, if future negotiations of collective bargaining agreements or other discussions with the unions are not successful or become unproductive, the affected unions could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages or the possibility of such actions could delay or affect the transition process or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. We could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms.\nEnvironmental and other disasters may adversely impact our business.\nEnvironmental and other disasters, such as flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters, or a combination thereof, may negatively impact our business. Environmental and other disasters may cause disruption to our\noperations in the regions impacted by such disasters and impede our ability to sell our solutions and services. In addition, customers located in countries or regions impacted by environmental and other disasters, may decide to suspend or discontinue projects. The occurrence of any environmental and/or other material disasters may have an adverse impact on our business in the future.\nRisks Relating to International Operations\nGeopolitical, economic, security and military conditions in countries in which we and our third-party providers operate may adversely affect us.\nWe have significant operations outside the United States, including research and development, manufacturing, sales, and support. Geopolitical, economic, security and military conditions could directly affect our operations or those of our third-party providers. Recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, including terrorist activities, military actions or political unrest, instability marked by civil war, military actions and conflicts in or adjacent to countries in which we or our third-party providers operate and the nationalization of privately-owned telecommunications companies, may cause disruptions to our business. Adverse Geopolitical, economic, security and military conditions may result in delays in or disruption to our research and developments activities, project deployment, manufacture and shipments of products, service and support services and delays or cancellations of customer orders. If these risks were to materialize, our business, including revenue, profitability and cash flows, would likely be materially adversely affected. In addition, if these events result in restrictions on travel or unsafe travel conditions, our ability to service our existing clients on-site and secure new business from potential new clients would likely be adversely affected. In addition, employees of ours and our third-party providers in certain countries are required to perform annual mandatory military service and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances. The absence of these employees may have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our total revenue from customers outside the United States and have significant international operations, which subject us to risks inherent with foreign operations.\nFor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we derived approximately 70%, 69%, and 60% respectively, of our total revenue from customers outside of the United States. We maintain significant international operations in the Czech Republic, India, Israel and the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout the world, including with respect to business functions that we may engage third parties to operate. Approximately 89% of our employees and approximately 79% of our facilities were located outside the United States as of January 31, 2016. Conducting business internationally exposes us to particular risks inherent in doing business in international markets, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nlack of acceptance of non-localized products;\n\u2022\nlegal and cultural differences in the conduct of business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in hiring qualified foreign employees and staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and withholding taxes that limit the repatriation of cash;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade conditions;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nrapid and unforeseen changes in economic conditions in individual countries;\n\u2022\nincreased costs resulting from lack of proximity to customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with varied legal and regulatory requirements across jurisdictions, including tax laws, labor laws, employee benefits, customs requirements and currency restrictions;\n\u2022\ndifferent tax regimes and potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nimmigration regulations that limit our ability to deploy our employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with applicable export laws and regulations requiring licensure or authorization to sell products;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in repatriating cash held by our foreign subsidiaries on a tax efficient basis; and\n\u2022\nturbulence in foreign currency and credit markets.\nOne or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations.\nOur business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments, including with government owned or controlled CSPs, increase the risks associated with our international activities.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (or the FCPA) and other laws of the United States and other countries, including the UK Bribery Act 2010 (or the UK Bribery Act), that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, deal with customers and make sales in countries known to experience corruption. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors that could be in violation of various U.S. and local laws, including the FCPA and the UK Bribery Act, even though these parties are not always subject to our control.\nWe have implemented safeguards designed to eliminate improper practices by our employees, consultants, external sales agents and resellers. However, these safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, external sales agents or distributors may engage in the future in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA and other laws of the United States and other countries may result in significant civil and/or criminal penalties and other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, violations of these laws, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, may harm our reputation and deter governmental agencies and other existing or potential customers from buying our products and engaging our services.\nRules of the Authority for Technological Innovation (formerly known as the Office of the Chief Scientist) may limit our ability to transfer technology outside of Israel or engage in strategic transactions or require us to pay redemption fees in the event we engage in such transactions.\nHistorically, a portion of the research and development operations of our Israeli subsidiary benefited from financial incentives provided by government agencies to promote research and development activities performed in Israel. Our research and development activities included projects submitted for partial funding under a program administered by the Authority for Technological Innovation of the Israeli Ministry of the Economy, formerly known as the Office of the Chief Scientist (or the ATI), under which reimbursement of a portion of our research and development expenditures was made subject to final approval of project budgets. Although the Government of Israel does not own proprietary rights in the ATI-funded Products and there is no specific restriction by the ATI with regard to the export of the ATI-funded Products, under certain circumstances, there may be limitations on our ability to transfer technology, know-how and manufacturing of ATI-funded Products outside of Israel. Such limitations could result in the requirement to pay increased royalties or a redemption fee calculated according to the applicable regulations. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, we discontinued the practice of seeking funding from the ATI and accordingly, there were no new programs initiated with the ATI during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. In addition, we do not plan to submit any new applications for funding. However, the limitations on the transfer of technology, know-how and manufacturing of ATI-funded Products outside of Israel continue to apply. The difficulties in obtaining the approval of the ATI for the transfer of technology, know-how, manufacturing activities and/or manufacturing rights out of Israel could impair the ability of some of our subsidiaries to outsource manufacturing, enter into strategic alliances or engage in similar arrangements for those technologies, know-how or products or, if approved may require us to pay significant redemption fees. If we are restricted from engaging in such transactions or may be required to pay redemption fees, our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nCurrency exchange rates, fluctuations of currency exchange rates and limitations imposed by certain countries on the outflow of their currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAlthough partially mitigated by our hedging activities, we are impacted by currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof in a number of ways, including the fact that:\n\u2022\nA significant portion of our expenses, principally salaries and related personnel expenses, are incurred in new Israeli shekels (or NIS), whereas the currency we use to report our financial results is the U.S. dollar and most of our revenue is generated in U.S. dollars. A significant strengthening of the NIS against the U.S. dollar can considerably increase the U.S. dollar value of our expenses in Israel. Should the NIS strengthen in comparison to the U.S. dollar our results of operations will be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nA portion of our international sales is denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, such as the euro, thereby exposing us to gains and losses on non-U.S. currency transactions;\n\u2022\nA substantial portion of our international sales is denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, devaluation in the local currencies of our customers relative to the U.S. dollar may impair the purchasing power of our customers and could cause customers to decrease or cancel orders or default on payment, which could harm our results of operations; and\n\u2022\nWe translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our financial statements. During periods of a strengthening dollar, our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars.\nAs noted above, from time to time, we enter into hedging transactions to attempt to limit the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. However, such hedging transactions may not prevent all exchange rate-related losses and risks. Therefore, our business and profitability may be harmed by such exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, certain countries in which we operate, or in which we may operate, limit the outflow of their currencies to purchase products from foreign companies thus limiting the ability of existing or potential customers to purchase our products. As a result, these practices may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including revenue, profitability and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Recent Material Transactions\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties arising out of the MSA pursuant to which a substantial portion of the employee base was transferred to a third-party, Tech Mahindra, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations, and our stock price.\nOn June 1, 2015, Tech Mahindra began performing certain services for our business on a global basis. In connection with the master services agreement with Tech Mahindra, approximately 500 of our employees have been rehired by Tech Mahindra or its affiliates. Further, we are materially dependent on Tech Mahindra for certain critical functions and operations, including research and development, project deployment, delivery, maintenance, and support services. A significant portion of Tech Mahindra\u2019s employees that provide us services under the master services are located in Israel and are represented by a representative organization. As a result, Tech Mahindra may face labor disputes or experience strikes or work stoppages. Any failure on Tech Mahindra\u2019s part could materially affect our business and financial results and we may fail to achieve the cost savings and other benefits anticipated from the master services agreement.\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties arising out of the completed divestiture of our BSS Business, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations, and our stock price.\nWe completed the sale of our BSS Business on July 2, 2015. There may be delays in the realization of anticipated benefits of the sale. Following the closing of the sale of the BSS Business, the purchase price is subject to various post-closing adjustment provisions relating to compliance with our representations, warranties and covenants, including post-closing covenants relating to the procurement of various third-party consents, over which we will have no meaningful control.\nIn connection with the Asset Sale, we agreed to indemnify Amdocs for certain pre-closing liabilities and breaches of certain representations and warranties. Upon the closing, $26 million of the purchase price was deposited into escrow to fund potential indemnification claims and certain adjustments for a period of 12 months following the closing. In August 2015 and May 2016, we received various claims for indemnification against the escrow from Amdocs. We could receive additional claims in the future. While we continue to evaluate certain claims made, we believe several pending claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. Nonetheless, amounts held in escrow necessary to satisfy pending claims will remain unavailable to us until these claims are resolved. In addition, we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of these or future claims that Amdocs may assert against us in connection with the asset sale, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn connection with the divestiture of the BSS Business, certain previously allocated corporate overhead costs (indirect BSS costs) charged to the former BSS segment were excluded from discontinued operations and included in continuing operations. Following the closing of the sale of the BSS business, our efforts to reduce such costs and expenses, including through restructuring initiatives, may not be as successful as anticipated, or at all. We may encounter difficulties in implementing restructuring initiatives in certain countries in a timely manner, or at all, and restructuring costs may ultimately exceed our initial estimates. There is no assurance that these initiatives will reduce costs and the costs to implement them may not offset any savings for a period of time.\nThe failure to successfully integrate the Acision business and/or fully realize expected synergies from the acquisition in the expected timeframe or at all may adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe success of the Acision acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our business prior to the acquisition with the acquired business of Acision. Prior to the completion of the transaction, our business and the acquired Acision business operated independently. The integration process is ongoing and may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction. We have experienced and may experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Integration efforts between the two companies have and may continue to divert management attention and resources. These integration\nmatters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period. In addition, even if we successfully integrate business operations, we may not realize the full expected benefits of the transaction, including the synergies, cost savings, sales and growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nAlso, we have incurred acquisition-related and integration costs, including legal and accounting fees and expenses, and other related charges. We expect to incur additional integration costs, such as IT and financial reporting and controls integration expenses, retention costs and severance costs, which may be higher than expected. We also may incur unanticipated integration-related costs. As a result, we cannot assure you that the combination of our business and the acquired business of Acision will result in the realization of the full synergies and other benefits, or any of them, anticipated from the transaction.\nAcision\u2019s indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs.\nUpon the signing of the definitive documentation relating to the Acision acquisition, Acision, in consultation with us, entered into a consent, waiver and first amendment (referred to as the Amendment) to the Acision senior credit facility, which became effective concurrent with the completion of the Acision acquisition and pursuant to which Acision\u2019s debt under its senior credit facility remains in place. In connection with the Amendment, we have paid certain fees and costs imposed on Acision by its senior lenders as a condition to the effectiveness of the Amendment. The Acision senior credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative, restrictive and financial covenants, each of which may impose operating and financial restrictions on us and Acision, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our long-term best interests. These provisions, with certain exceptions, restrict Acision\u2019s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) create, incur, assume or permit to exist any liens, (iii) enter into mergers, consolidations or similar transactions, (iv) make investments and acquisitions, (v) make certain dispositions of assets, (vi) make dividends, distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness, and (vii) enter into certain transactions with affiliates. The Acision senior credit facility also contains customary events of default, including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, material adverse effect defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and material judgment default.\nThe operating restrictions and covenants in the Acision senior credit facility and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions. Acision\u2019s ability to comply with any such covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our and/or Acision\u2019s control, and Acision may be unable to satisfy any such requirements. If Acision fails to comply with any such covenants or any event of default occurs, Acision may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants or events of default from the lenders under its senior credit facility or we and/or Acision may seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce its expenditures. Acision may be unable to obtain such waivers or amendments or we and/or Acision may not be able to obtain such alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all, or on favorable terms.\nAcision is required to make periodic principal and interest payments and, in certain circumstances, mandatory prepayments pursuant to the terms of the Acision senior credit facility. If an event of default occurs, the interest rate on any amounts due will increase and the lenders under the Acision senior credit facility may declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees and costs, to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral provided by Acision and its subsidiaries as security. Acision may not be able to repay all amounts due under the Acision senior credit facility in the event these amounts are accelerated and declared due upon an event of default.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the Acision acquisition.\nUncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on our employees may have an adverse effect on the combined business. This uncertainty may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. If our key employees depart, we may incur costs in identifying, hiring, training and retaining replacements for departing employees, which could reduce our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nRisks Relating to our Operation as an Independent, Publicly-Traded Company\nWe have determined that material weaknesses exist in our internal control over financial reporting relative to our Acision subsidiary and tax accounting process that could, if not remediated, have a material adverse impact on our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements.\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 relative to our Acision subsidiary and tax accounting process, as described in Part II, Item 9A of this Annual Report. As a result of these material weaknesses, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2016. We originally identified the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting\nas of October 31, 2015 relative to our Acision subsidiary, as described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period then ended. As a result of such material weakness we were unable to timely file our Quarterly Report for the period ended October 31, 2015. The material weakness in our tax accounting process was identified during the three months ended January 31, 2016 and is being reported for the first time in this Annual Report.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are actively engaged in the planning for and implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses that we identified. Our remediation initiatives include (i) the strengthening of Acision\u2019s internal processes and our tax department, including training for personnel, ensuring account reconciliations are completed and reviewed properly on a timely basis; and (ii) accelerating movement of certain accounting transactions to Ra\u2019anana as appropriate while assessing and upgrading accounting resources as needed throughout our company to ensure reliable accounting processes and effectiveness of managerial reviews. While we have deployed additional resources and work processes at our recently-acquired Acision subsidiary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting, and undertaken a significant redesign of our financial reporting work processes to ensure that our disclosure controls and procedures, including at our Acision subsidiary, will be effective for subsequent fiscal periods, we are still in the process of implementing and testing these processes and procedures. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls has, and may continue to distract our officers and employees and entail material costs to implement new processes or modify our existing processes. Moreover, investors\u2019 perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm our stock price. We may conclude that additional measures are required to remediate the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures that may necessitate additional implementation and evaluation time. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely manner or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be a risk of future material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements and a potential material adverse effect on our ability to file our periodic reports timely.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will be exempt from certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nIn April 2012, President Obama signed into law the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for emerging growth companies, including certain requirements relating to accounting standards and executive compensation disclosure. We are classified as an emerging growth company, which is defined as a company with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion, that has been a public reporting company for a period of less than five years, and that does not have a public float of $700 million or more in securities held by non-affiliated holders. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, unless we elect not to take advantage of applicable JOBS Act provisions, we will not be required to (1) provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are also applicable to private companies under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, (3) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (4) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, (5) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or (6) hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs noted above, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of such extended transition period. Since we would then not be required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that comply with public company effective dates. If we were to elect to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.\nThe cost of compliance or failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may adversely affect our business.\nAs a new reporting company under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (or the Exchange Act), we are subject to certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which may result in higher compliance costs and may adversely affect our financial results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act affects corporate governance, securities disclosure, compliance practices, internal audits, disclosure controls and procedures, financial reporting and accounting systems. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,\nfor example, requires companies subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. We are required to provide our Section 404 evaluation with this annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. The failure to comply with Section 404 may result in investors losing confidence in the reliability of our financial statements (which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock), prevent us from providing the required financial information in a timely manner (which could materially and adversely impact our business, our financial condition, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital markets, if necessary), prevent us from otherwise complying with the standards applicable to us as an independent, publicly traded company and subject us to adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe may continue to incur significant expenses for professional fees in connection with the preparation of our periodic reports.\nWe have periodically engaged outside accounting consulting firms and other external consultants to assist our finance and accounting personnel in the preparation of financial statements and periodic reports and incurred significant expenses for their services. Although we expect these expenses to decline and be eliminated over time as we enhance our internal finance and accounting personnel to replace such external consultants and build these functions as an independent, publicly traded company, we may in the near term incur significant expenses relating to professional fees in connection with the preparation of periodic reports, which may materially adversely affect our financial position and cash flows.\nWe agreed to indemnify a subsidiary of Verint Systems Inc. (or Verint) as successor to CTI and its affiliates following the merger of CTI with and into a subsidiary of Verint (referred to as the Verint Merger) after the Verint Merger against certain claims or losses that may arise in connection with the Verint Merger and the Share Distribution.\nUnder the Distribution Agreement we and CTI entered into in connection with the Share Distribution, we have agreed to indemnify CTI and its affiliates (including Verint after the Verint Merger) against certain losses that may arise as a result of the Verint Merger and the Share Distribution. Certain of our indemnification obligations are capped at $25.0 million and certain are uncapped. Specifically, the capped indemnification obligations include indemnifying CTI and its affiliates (including Verint after the Verint Merger) against losses stemming from breaches by CTI of representations, warranties and covenants in the Verint Merger Agreement and for any liabilities of CTI that were known by CTI but not included on the net worth statement delivered by CTI at the closing of the Verint Merger. Our uncapped indemnification obligations include indemnifying CTI and its affiliates (including Verint after the Verint Merger) against liabilities relating to our business; claims by any shareholder or creditor of CTI related to the Share Distribution, the Verint Merger or related transactions or disclosure documents; certain claims made by employees or former employees of CTI and any claims made by employees and former employees of ours (including but not limited to the Israeli optionholder suits discussed in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report; any failure by us to perform under any of the agreements entered into in connection with the Share Distribution; claims related to CTI's ownership or operation of our company; claims related to the Starhome Disposition (as defined in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report); certain retained liabilities of CTI that are not reflected on or reserved against on the net worth statement delivered by CTI at the closing of the Verint Merger; and claims arising out of the exercise of appraisal rights by a CTI shareholder in connection with the Share Distribution.\nFuture changes in stock ownership could limit our use of net operating loss carryforwards.\nAs of January 31, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $369.0 million available to offset future federal taxable income. Similarly, we had net operating loss carryforwards to offset state taxable income in varying amounts. As a result of changes in stock ownership that may take place in the future, there may be limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards. Limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income could reduce the benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards by requiring us, as applicable, to pay federal and state income taxes earlier than otherwise would be required, and causing part of our net operating loss carryforwards to expire without having been fully utilized. These various limitations resulting from an ownership change could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations. We cannot predict the extent to which our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited or the ultimate impact of other limitations that may be caused by future changes in stock ownership, which will depend on various factors.\nWe may have significant liabilities for taxes of the CTI consolidated group for periods ended on or before the Share Distribution date, and may have an indemnity obligation to CTI for any tax on the Share Distribution.\nWe and our controlled domestic subsidiaries were members of CTI's consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Share Distribution was a taxable transaction and resulted in our deconsolidation from the CTI consolidated group. U.S. federal income tax law provides that each member of a consolidated group is jointly and severally liable for the consolidated group's entire federal income tax liability for periods when they are members of the same group. Similar principles\nmay apply for foreign, state or local tax purposes where CTI had previously filed or may be determined to have been required to file combined, consolidated or unitary returns with us or our subsidiaries for foreign, state or local tax purposes. In addition, as part of the Share Distribution, we have entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement with CTI, which sets out each party's rights and obligations with respect to deficiencies and refunds, if any, of federal, state, local or foreign taxes for periods before and after the Distribution and related matters such as the filing of tax returns and the conduct of IRS and other audits. Pursuant to the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, we are required to indemnify CTI for losses and tax liabilities of the CTI consolidated group for periods (or portions thereof) ending at or before the end of the day on the Share Distribution date. Also, since the Share Distribution was a taxable transaction, CTI will be treated as if it had sold the stock of our Company in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and pursuant to the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement we are required to indemnify CTI for any tax on the Share Distribution. Since we are required to indemnify CTI under any circumstance set forth in the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could have a material negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, which may make it difficult for stockholders to resell shares of common stock at times or prices that they find attractive.\nThe price of our common stock on NASDAQ constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations concerning our future financial performance and the future performance of the communication industry in general, including financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ndifferences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nstrategic moves by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory framework affecting our international operations; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nSubstantial sales of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nAll of our outstanding shares may be sold immediately in the public market. The sales of significant amounts of our common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in the lowering of the market price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may be adversely affected through dilution.\nWe may need to issue equity in order to fund working capital, capital expenditures and product development requirements or to make acquisitions and other investments. If we choose to raise funds or make acquisitions and other investments through the issuance of common equity, the issuance will dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will pay any dividends.\nWe do not currently plan to pay any dividends. We cannot provide assurance that we will pay any dividends in the future, continue to pay any dividends if we do commence the payment of dividends, or that if we do decide to pay dividends, what the amount of dividends will be or that we will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, or increases in reserves. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for you to receive a gain on your investment in us. This appreciation may not occur.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents, our stockholder rights plan, and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our charter, bylaws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable and diminish the opportunity for stockholders to participate in acquisition proposals at a price above the then-current market price of our common stock. For example, our charter and bylaws authorize our Board, without further stockholder approval, to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock and fix the powers, preferences, rights, and limitations of such class or series, which could adversely\naffect the voting power of your shares. In addition, our bylaws provide for an advance notice procedure for nomination of candidates to our Board that could have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change in control.\nWe also have adopted a stockholder rights plan as a deterrent against an \u201cownership change\u201d under federal tax law that would diminish our ability to utilize our significant net operating losses and other tax attributes. Although the rights plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us, we cannot assure that it would prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change. Further, because the rights plan may restrict a stockholder\u2019s ability to acquire our stock, the liquidity and market value of our stock might be adversely affected. The rights plan also may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that becomes an \"acquiring person\" under the plan and may discourage or delay a merger or acquisition that individual stockholders consider favorable or in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of the DGCL regarding \u201cbusiness combinations,\u201d which can deter attempted takeovers in certain situations. We may, in the future, consider adopting additional anti-takeover measures. The authority of our Board to issue undesignated preferred or other capital stock and the anti-takeover provisions of the DGCL, as well as other current and any future anti-takeover measures adopted by us, may, in certain circumstances, delay, deter, or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of us not approved by our Board.", "PERMNO": 13636, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MESG"}
