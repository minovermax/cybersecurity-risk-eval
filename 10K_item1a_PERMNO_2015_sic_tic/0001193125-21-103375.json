RISK FACTORS\nOur short and long-term success is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors that are difficult to predict or beyond our control. As a result, investing in the Company\u2019s common stock involves substantial risk. The Company\u2019s stockholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report, as well as the other information we file with the SEC from time to time. If any of these risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider to be immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly in light of the fast-changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures, the potential for future waves of outbreaks and the related impacts to the travel industry and on United, Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner. Certain statements made in this section constitute \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including those described in this section. For additional information, refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d within this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur current business is highly dependent on the United capacity purchase agreement because United is currently Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner.\nWe derive nearly all of our operating revenue from the United capacity purchase agreement because United is currently Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner. United accounted for approximately 99.9% of our operating revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The termination of the United capacity purchase agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United capacity purchase agreement expires in February 2023, unless United elects to exercise its option to extend the agreement. United is also permitted, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the agreement early in the event of Air Wisconsin\u2019s material breach of the agreement. The United capacity purchase agreement is also subject to termination prior to expiration in various circumstances, including if Air Wisconsin\u2019s controllable flight completion factor or departure performance falls below certain pre-determined levels, and in the event of a non-carrier-specific grounding of at least a specified number of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, in each case for a specified period of time. Disputes between United and Air Wisconsin have arisen in the past, and, while the prior disputes have been resolved, it is possible that new disputes may arise in the future. New disputes or disagreements with United could result in Air Wisconsin incurring negotiation or resolution costs or entering into litigation or other proceedings. Even if resolved in Air Wisconsin\u2019s favor, the existence of a dispute could harm Air Wisconsin\u2019s relationship with United.\nAir Wisconsin currently uses the systems, facilities and services of United to support a significant portion of its operations. If United were to cease to maintain any of these systems, close any of these facilities, or no longer provide these services to Air Wisconsin, whether due to termination of the United capacity purchase agreement, a strike or other labor interruption by United personnel, bankruptcy or other financial hardship experienced by United, or for any other reason, Air Wisconsin may not be able to obtain access to alternative systems, facilities or services on terms and conditions as favorable as those it currently receives, or at all. Upon certain termination events described in the United capacity purchase agreement, United could require Air Wisconsin to sell or assign to United certain facilities and assets that Air Wisconsin uses in connection with the services it provides. As a result, in order to offer airline service after termination of the United capacity purchase agreement, Air Wisconsin may have to replace these facilities, assets and services. Air Wisconsin may be unable to arrange such replacements on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nDelta Airlines has announced that it intends to retire the CRJ-200 aircraft in its fleet by 2023. If the United capacity purchase agreement were to be terminated, or if United chose to remove 50-seat aircraft, such as Air Wisconsin\u2019s CRJ-200 aircraft, from its fleet, or otherwise decided not to extend the agreement, our business would be significantly impacted, and it is unlikely we would have an immediate source of revenue or earnings to offset the financial impact. United is not under any obligation to extend the term of the United capacity purchase agreement, whether on similar terms or at all.\nThe United capacity purchase agreement permits United to terminate the agreement upon certain changes of control of Air Wisconsin, which could limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to pursue certain corporate transactions. A termination or expiration of this agreement would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to satisfy debt obligations, unless we are able to enter into satisfactory substitute arrangements for the utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft and spare engines. We may not be able to enter into substitute arrangements, and any arrangements we are able to secure may not be as favorable to us as the current agreement.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse impact on the business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity of United, which is Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner, and the duration and spread of the pandemic could result in additional adverse impacts to United, or cause it to declare bankruptcy, which may cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be negatively impacted.\nWe may be directly affected by the financial and operating performance of United, which is Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner. Any events that negatively impact the financial or operating performance of United, including the impact of the reduction in passenger flight demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other widespread outbreaks of communicable diseases, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, United experienced a significant decline in flight demand related to COVID-19 and a resulting material deterioration in its revenue. While there has been a modest demand recovery, this reduction in demand is expected to continue. United has indicated that it expects its results of operations to continue to be materially impacted through 2021.\nAs a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global passenger flight demand and United\u2019s financial and operational performance, United may be unable to make payments due to Air Wisconsin under the United capacity purchase agreement in a timely manner or at all. Any failure by United to make timely payments due to Air Wisconsin may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if United were to become bankrupt, the United capacity purchase agreement may not be assumed in bankruptcy and could be terminated, and such termination would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on United\u2019s operational and financial performance (and, therefore, on our operational and financial performance) will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of Air Wisconsin\u2019s control, including the effectiveness of United\u2019s mitigation strategies, the duration and spread of COVID-19 and resulting impact on the financial health and operations of United\u2019s and Air Wisconsin\u2019s business partners, changes in global and regional passenger flight demand, and future governmental actions in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIf United provides Air Wisconsin with inefficient flight schedules, or makes certain changes to the expected utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft under the United capacity purchase agreement, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the United capacity purchase agreement, United has the ability to schedule Air Wisconsin\u2019s flights in any manner that serves United\u2019s purposes, subject to certain reasonable operating constraints which do not prevent United from scheduling Air Wisconsin\u2019s flights in a manner Air Wisconsin deems inefficient. From time to time, United schedules Air Wisconsin\u2019s flights in a manner which creates operational inefficiencies for Air Wisconsin, such as by building in long crew layovers or overnights, or by providing Air Wisconsin with flight schedules that are inconsistent with Air Wisconsin\u2019s existing operational footprint. These actions have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have led, and may in the future lead, United to modify the anticipated utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft under the United capacity purchase agreement, some of which are beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control. Any factors that continue to cause United to schedule the utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft on routes or at frequencies materially different than we have forecasted could further reduce our ability to realize operating efficiencies, which would continue to negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. United has stated publicly that it does not expect recovery from COVID-19 to follow a linear path and, as such, the actual number of flights United schedules under the United capacity purchase agreement in any particular period may be significantly different from the number of flights we initially anticipated or which United initially communicated for the period.\nThe amounts Air Wisconsin receives under the United capacity purchase agreement may be less than the corresponding costs Air Wisconsin incurs.\nUnder the United capacity purchase agreement, a portion of the revenue Air Wisconsin receives is based upon predetermined rates calculated by reference to certain factors, such as the number of covered aircraft, the number of block hours flown and the number of departures. The primary operating costs intended to be compensated by the predetermined rates include salaries and benefits, training costs, crew room costs, maintenance expenses, simulator and spare parts costs and overhead costs. If Air Wisconsin\u2019s costs for those items exceed the compensation paid at the rates set in the agreement, our financial position and operating results will be negatively affected.\nAir Wisconsin\u2019s current growth opportunities, strategic operating plan and future growth opportunities may be limited by the United capacity purchase agreement or a number of factors impacting the airline industry, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGrowth opportunities within United\u2019s current flight network may be limited by various factors, including \u201cscope\u201d clauses in United\u2019s current collective bargaining agreements with its pilots that restrict the number and size of regional aircraft that may be operated in its flight systems that are not flown by its pilots. Although United has significant room under its scope clauses with respect to 50-seat aircraft, which comprise Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet, these clauses could limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to operate larger aircraft for United which would limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s expansion opportunities. United is under no obligation to provide Air Wisconsin with an opportunity to fly additional aircraft within its system or to otherwise expand its relationship with Air Wisconsin.\nFurther, Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to expand its operations in the future may be limited by a number of factors impacting the airline industry, including access to airport terminals and facilities, terms of United\u2019s collective bargaining agreements limiting the usage of regional carriers, capital expenditures required to maintain or expand fleet operations, significant changes in variable costs, regulatory changes, changes in the availability of necessary parts and equipment, and intense competition and pricing pressure. Given the competitive nature of the airline industry, and the excess capacity in the industry due to the significantly depressed passenger demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe limited growth opportunities exist. To take advantage of these opportunities, to the extent and in the event that passenger demand for air travel rebounds, Air Wisconsin may be required to accept less favorable contract terms in order to secure new or additional flying opportunities. Due to the significant decline in passenger demand for air travel and the resulting economic disruption, there may not be any new or additional flying opportunities available to Air Wisconsin. In addition, even if Air Wisconsin is offered these growth opportunities in the future, they may involve economic terms or financing commitments that are unfavorable to Air Wisconsin or do not result in profitable operations.\nAir Wisconsin currently operates only one aircraft type, and relies on one aircraft manufacturer and one engine manufacturer, and any operating restrictions or safety concerns applicable to this aircraft or engine type, or any failure to receive sufficient maintenance and support services from these manufacturers, would negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nAir Wisconsin currently relies on a single aircraft type, the CRJ-200 regional jet, and a single engine type, the General Electric (\u201cGE\u201d) CF34-3B1 engine. The issuance of Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) or manufacturer directives restricting or prohibiting the use of this aircraft type or engine type, or Air Wisconsin\u2019s inability to obtain necessary goods and services related to this aircraft type or engine type, would negatively impact our business and financial results. In addition, any concerns raised regarding the safety or reliability of the CRJ-200 regional jet or the GE CF34-3B1 engine, whether or not directly associated with Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet, could result in concerns about Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet that could negatively impact our business.\nAir Wisconsin has been highly dependent upon Bombardier, Inc. (\u201cBombardier\u201d), as the sole manufacturer of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, and GE, as the sole manufacturer of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft engines, to provide sufficient parts or related maintenance and support services to it in a timely manner. In June 2020, Bombardier consummated an agreement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd (\u201cMitsubishi\u201d), pursuant to which Mitsubishi purchased Bombardier\u2019s regional jet program, including all aspects of the CRJ-200 regional jet, such as type certificates, maintenance, support,\nrefurbishment, marketing and sales activities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, the closing of this transaction may have on Mitsubishi\u2019s continued support of the CRJ-200 regional jet or Air Wisconsin\u2019s continued ability to obtain required parts and services. Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations could be materially and adversely affected by the failure or inability of Mitsubishi or GE to provide required maintenance or support services, or the interruption of Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations as a result of unscheduled or unanticipated maintenance requirements for Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft or engines.\nAir Wisconsin has a significant amount of debt and other contractual obligations that could impair its liquidity and ability to obtain additional financing and, in the event Air Wisconsin is unable to repay its debt and other contractual obligations, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nThe airline business is capital intensive and, as a result, Air Wisconsin is highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2020, Air Wisconsin had approximately $117.8 million (including capitalized interest of $10.9 million) in total third-party debt, which was incurred primarily in connection with the acquisition of aircraft, and most of which is secured by substantially all of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, engines and parts.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to various covenants under its financing agreements. Air Wisconsin\u2019s failure to comply with obligations under these credit facilities, which may be affected by factors beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control, could result in an event of default under the facilities. A default, if not cured or waived, could permit the lender to accelerate payment of the loans. In addition, the lender would have the right to proceed against the collateral security granted to a trustee for its benefit, which consists of substantially all of the aircraft, engines and parts owned by Air Wisconsin. If this debt is accelerated, we cannot be certain that Air Wisconsin will have funds available to pay the debt or that it will have the ability to refinance the debt on terms favorable to it, or at all. If Air Wisconsin could not repay or refinance the accelerated debt, it could be insolvent and could seek to file for bankruptcy protection.\nIn addition, the Payroll Support Program Agreement (the \u201cPSP-1 Agreement\u201d) that Air Wisconsin entered into in April 2020 with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\u201cTreasury\u201d) pursuant to the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) and the Payroll Support Program Extension Agreement (the \u201cPSP-2 Agreement\u201d) that Air Wisconsin entered into in March 2021 with the Treasury pursuant to Subtitle A of Title IV of Division N of the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the \u201cPSP Extension Law\u201d) contain various covenants. If Air Wisconsin fails to comply with its obligations under those agreements or other agreements Air Wisconsin may enter into with the Treasury for additional payroll support, it may be required to repay the funds provided to it under those agreements. Any such default, acceleration, insolvency or failure to comply would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot be certain Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations will generate sufficient cash flow to make its required payments under its debt and other contractual arrangements. Air Wisconsin does not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of its outstanding debt in full if such debt were accelerated. If Air Wisconsin is unable to pay its debts as they come due, or is unable to obtain waivers or extensions of time for such payments, its secured lenders could foreclose on any of Air Wisconsin\u2019s assets securing such debt. Additionally, a failure to pay Air Wisconsin\u2019s property leases, debt or other fixed cost obligations, or a breach of its other contractual obligations, could result in a variety of further adverse consequences, including the exercise of remedies by its creditors and lessors, such as acceleration. In such a situation, Air Wisconsin may not be able to cure its breach, fulfill its contractual obligations, make required lease payments or otherwise cover its fixed costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf Air Wisconsin is unable to source financing on acceptable terms, or at all, our business could be materially adversely affected. To the extent Air Wisconsin finances its activities with additional debt, it would become subject to additional debt service obligations, as well as additional covenants that may restrict its ability to pursue its business strategy or otherwise constrain its growth and operations. Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to pay the high level of fixed costs associated with operating a regional airline will therefore depend on its operating performance, cash flows and ability to secure adequate financing, which will in turn depend on, among other things, the success of its current business strategy, availability and cost of financing, as well as general economic and political conditions and other factors that may be beyond its control.\nA significant portion of Air Wisconsin\u2019s workforce is represented by labor unions and the terms of Air Wisconsin\u2019s collective bargaining agreements may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 841 of Air Wisconsin\u2019s employees were represented by labor unions, including the Air Line Pilots Association, International (\u201cALPA\u201d), the Association of Flight Attendants (\u201cAFA\u201d), the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers AFL-CIO (\u201cIAMAW\u201d), and the Transport Workers Union of America (\u201cTWU\u201d). The terms and conditions of future collective bargaining agreements may be affected by the results of collective bargaining negotiations at other airlines that may have a greater ability, due to larger scale, greater efficiency, or other factors, to bear higher costs than Air Wisconsin, which may result in higher industry wages and increased pressure on Air Wisconsin to increase the wages and benefits of its employees. Future agreements may be on terms that are less favorable to Air Wisconsin than its current agreements or not comparable to agreements entered into by its competitors. Moreover, we cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements. Any agreements reached in collective bargaining may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our financial results. If Air Wisconsin is unable to reach agreement with any of its unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, it may be subject to work interruptions, stoppages or shortages.\nMaintenance costs will likely increase as the age of Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet increases.\nThe average age of Air Wisconsin\u2019s CRJ-200 regional jets as of December 31, 2020 was more than 18 years. As Air Wisconsin\u2019s fleet continues to age, its maintenance costs may increase, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of its operating expenses, and may result in out-of-service periods during which aircraft are dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable for flying under the United capacity purchase agreement. Any unexpected increase in Air Wisconsin\u2019s maintenance costs as its fleet ages, or decreased revenue resulting from out-of-service periods, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe loss of key personnel upon whom Air Wisconsin depends to operate its business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Among other things, the agreements that Air Wisconsin has entered into, and expects to enter into, with the Treasury in connection with the Treasury provided payroll support impose significant restrictions on Air Wisconsin\u2019s executive compensation. Such restrictions, over time, will likely result in lower executive compensation in the airline industry than is prevailing in other industries, which may present retention challenges in the case of executives presented with alternative, non-airline opportunities. Any inability to attract or retain qualified management personnel and other employees would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nShould the passenger demand for air travel rebound following the COVID-19 pandemic, Air Wisconsin may experience difficulty hiring, training and retaining a sufficient number of qualified pilots, which may negatively affect our operations and financial condition.\nHistorically, the supply of qualified pilots to the airline industry has been limited, which created difficulty hiring, training and retaining a sufficient number of qualified pilots. In July 2013, the FAA issued stringent pilot qualification and crew member flight training standards, which increased the required training time for new airline pilots (the \u201cFAA Qualification Standards\u201d), and the FAA also mandated stricter rules to minimize pilot fatigue, increasing the number of pilots required to be employed for Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations as they existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and correspondingly increasing Air Wisconsin\u2019s labor costs. As a result of the significant decline in passenger demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no current shortage of qualified pilots in the airline industry. But if passenger demand for air travel increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, Air Wisconsin may again experience challenges in hiring and maintaining sufficient numbers of qualified pilots due to a number of factors, including the increased flight hour requirements under the FAA Qualification Standards, the statutory mandatory retirement age of 65, and attrition resulting from the hiring needs of other airlines. Air Wisconsin has historically also experienced increases in time and resources required to train pilots due to several factors, including limited availability of flight simulators and instructors. If future pilot attrition rates outpace Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to hire and retain qualified pilots, Air Wisconsin may be unable to fly the number of flights required under the United capacity purchase agreement, which may result in penalties under the agreement that would negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nInformation technology security breaches, hardware or software failures or other information technology infrastructure disruptions may negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nThe performance and reliability of Air Wisconsin\u2019s technology, the technology of United, and the technology of our third-party service providers, are critical to Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to compete effectively. Any internal technological error or failure or large-scale external interruption in the technological infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt Air Wisconsin\u2019s internal network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of Air Wisconsin\u2019s technology, or that of United or our third-party service providers, could impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to conduct its business, lower the utilization of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft and result in increased costs. Air Wisconsin\u2019s technological systems, software and related data, those of United, and those supplied by our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption or exploitation due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues.\nIn addition, as a part of Air Wisconsin\u2019s ordinary business operations, it collects and stores sensitive data, including personal information of its employees and information of United. Air Wisconsin\u2019s information systems are subject to an increasing threat of evolving cybersecurity attacks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to Air Wisconsin\u2019s systems or information through fraud or other means of deception. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. Air Wisconsin may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of Air Wisconsin\u2019s technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, employees\u2019, passengers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information and disruption to its operations, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe duration and spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the outbreak of any other disease or similar public health threat that we may face in the future, could result in additional adverse effects on the business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity of Air Wisconsin and United.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, and the U.S. Department of State issued a Level 4 \u201cdo not travel\u201d advisory for all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19. Air Wisconsin\u2019s amount of flying remains significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. United, Air Wisconsin\u2019s sole airline partner, began experiencing a significant decline in domestic and international demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the first quarter of 2020, resulting in a first quarter net loss. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report, United expects demand will remain suppressed in 2021. As a result of lowered demand, United has made significant cuts to its scheduled capacity since June 2020.\nSince March 2020, United has significantly reduced the number of Air Wisconsin\u2019s scheduled departures and block hours flown, and United may impose continued reductions.\nThe severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on global and financial health are difficult to predict; thus, the magnitude and scope of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and future results of operations are highly uncertain and subject to change.\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control, including the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies employed by United, the duration and spread of COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial health and operations and those of United, United\u2019s compliance with the United capacity purchase agreement, and future governmental actions, all of\nwhich are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. A long-term continuation of reduced passenger demand for air travel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Moreover, to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth herein.\nWorldwide, several regional and larger carriers have ceased operations as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2020, United announced that it was terminating its flying agreement with ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (\u201cExpressJet\u201d). In September 2020, ExpressJet ceased operations. As of the date of this filing, in addition to ExpressJet, Miami Air International, Trans States Airlines and Compass Airlines, each of which are domestic regional or charter airlines, have either filed for Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy or ceased operations as a result, at least in part, due to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on their business. In addition, a further outbreak of COVID-19, an outbreak of another disease or similar public health threat, or any other event that would affect travel demand, travel behavior or travel restrictions, including the material decline in passenger demand for air travel, and the significant risks and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results and those of United.\nThe airline industry is often negatively impacted by numerous factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe business of airlines is affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control, including air traffic congestion at airports, air traffic control inefficiencies, facility disruptions, acts of war or terrorism, increased security measures, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and the outbreak of disease. Factors that cause flight delays frustrate passengers and increase operating costs and decrease revenue, which in turn could adversely affect profitability. Because Air Wisconsin\u2019s revenue (other than the portion of its revenue based on the number of aircraft covered under the United capacity purchase agreement) depends primarily on Air Wisconsin\u2019s completion of flights, and secondarily on service factors such as timeliness of departure and arrival, customer satisfaction, cancellations or delays, any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to the factors noted above, while Air Wisconsin is to some extent protected from certain market conditions under the United capacity purchase agreement, its operations and our financial condition are currently affected, and may in the future be affected, by many other industry factors and conditions beyond Air Wisconsin\u2019s control, including, among others:\n\u2022\nactual or potential changes in economic conditions, including disruptions in the credit markets, recession, inflation, increased interest rates or fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nactual or potential changes in political conditions, including wars, outbreak of hostilities, terrorism or other political instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for airline travel or tourism and changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, discretionary spending or demographic trends;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive environment due to pricing, industry consolidation or other factors; and\n\u2022\nlabor disputes, strikes, work stoppages, or similar matters impacting employees.\nThe effect of any of the foregoing factors or conditions on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations is difficult to forecast; however, the occurrence of any or all of such factors or conditions could materially and adversely affect its operations and our financial condition.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and has undergone a period of consolidation and transition leaving fewer potential major airline partners.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive. Air Wisconsin competes primarily with other regional airlines, some of which are owned or operated by major airlines. The airline industry has undergone substantial consolidation, including the mergers between Alaska Airlines and Virgin America, American Airlines and US Airways, Southwest and AirTran Airways, United and Continental Airlines and Delta and Northwest Airlines. Any additional consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry could further limit the number of potential partners with whom Air Wisconsin could enter into capacity purchase agreements. In addition, any further consolidation activity involving United, or reduction in the size of its network, could alter its business strategy or its perception of the value of its relationship with Air Wisconsin, which could limit opportunities for Air Wisconsin to provide additional service to United. Similarly, any further consolidation or restructuring of any major air carrier\u2019s regional jet programs could negatively impact Air Wisconsin\u2019s future growth opportunities.\nIn the course of consolidation, major airlines may also make other strategic changes, such as relocating or consolidating hubs. For example, in May 2020, United temporarily ceased Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations at Washington-Dulles and significantly reduced Air Wisconsin\u2019s average daily scheduled departures. Air Wisconsin resumed operations at Washington-Dulles in August, but we cannot be certain United will not make future changes to Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations. If United were to make changes such as these in its strategy and operations, or otherwise decide to reduce the size of its network, Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and our financial results could be adversely impacted.\nTerrorist activities or warnings have dramatically impacted the airline industry and will likely continue to do so.\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath negatively impacted the airline industry in general. If additional terrorist attacks are launched, there may be lasting consequences, which may include loss of life, property damage, increased security measures, higher insurance costs, increased concerns about future terrorist attacks and additional government regulation, among other factors. Additional terrorist attacks, and warnings that such attacks may occur, could negatively impact the airline industry, and result in decreased passenger traffic, increased flight delays or cancellations, as well as increased security, fuel and other costs. A terrorist attack, whether or not involving Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.\nThe occurrence of an aviation accident or incident involving Air Wisconsin or its aircraft type could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.\nAn accident or incident involving Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft could result in significant potential claims of injured passengers and others, as well as negative impacts on its operations resulting from the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service. If substantial claims resulting from an accident are made in excess of our related liability insurance coverage, then our operational and financial results would be harmed. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured, could cause a public perception that Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations are less safe or reliable than other airlines, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, given that Air Wisconsin currently operates a single aircraft type, any accident or incident involving the CRJ-200 regional jet aircraft type, whether or not operated by Air Wisconsin, may result in Air Wisconsin temporarily or permanently suspending service on all or a large portion of its fleet. Any grounding of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft could have an adverse impact on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations, its relationship with United, and our financial results. In addition, any accident or incident involving a CRJ-200 regional jet, regardless of the operator or geographic location of the incident, could cause a public perception that the aircraft type is less safe and reliable than other aircraft types, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to significant governmental regulation and potential regulatory changes.\nAll air carriers, including Air Wisconsin, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d), the FAA and other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements. We cannot predict whether the cost of continued compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations. A decision by the FAA to ground, or require time consuming inspections of or maintenance on, all or any of Air Wisconsin\u2019s aircraft for\nany reason may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Air Wisconsin incurs substantial costs complying with applicable governmental regulations, and Air Wisconsin\u2019s business may also be subject to additional costs as a result of potential regulatory changes, which additional costs could have an adverse effect on Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and our financial results. In addition to state and federal regulation, airports and municipalities enact rules and regulations that affect Air Wisconsin\u2019s operations and require that it incur substantial ongoing costs.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to various environmental and noise laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAir Wisconsin is subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and noise, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water and the use, management, disposal and release of, and exposure to, hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. Certain legislative bodies and regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on climate change and have taken actions to implement additional laws, regulations, and programs intended to protect the environment. For example, the federal government, as well as several state and local governments, have implemented legislative and regulatory proposals and voluntary measures intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with laws, regulations, and other programs intended to reduce emissions or otherwise protect the environment may require Air Wisconsin to reduce its emissions, secure carbon offset credits or otherwise pay for emissions, or make capital investments to modify certain aspects of its operations to reduce emissions. Future policy, legal, and regulatory developments relating to the protection of the environment could have a direct effect on its operations (or an indirect effect through its third-party providers of goods or services or airport facilities at which it operates) and increase its costs and have a material adverse effect on its operations. Any such laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAir Wisconsin is also subject to environmental laws and regulations that require it to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under certain laws, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict and joint and several, meaning that Air Wisconsin could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to it, which liability could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe requirement that Air Wisconsin remain a citizen of the United States limits the potential purchasers of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nUnder DOT regulations and federal law, Air Wisconsin must be owned and controlled by citizens of the United States as that term is defined in the Federal Aviation Act and interpreted by the DOT. The restrictions imposed by federal law and regulations limit who can purchase Air Wisconsin\u2019s equity securities in the following ways:\n\u2022\nat least 75% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s voting equity securities must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by persons or entities who are citizens of the United States;\n\u2022\nat least 51% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s total outstanding equity securities must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens and no more than 49% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s equity securities may be held, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have entered into \u201copen skies\u201d air transport agreements with the U.S. which allow unrestricted access on air service routes between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country; and\n\u2022\ncitizens of foreign countries that have not entered into \u201copen skies\u201d air transport agreements with the U.S. may hold no more than 25% of Air Wisconsin\u2019s total outstanding equity securities.\nThe restrictions on foreign ownership of Air Wisconsin\u2019s equity securities may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder of the Company and may adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell the Company\u2019s common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nBecause there is no active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock, the common stock may continue to be illiquid.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is traded under the symbol \u201cHRBR\u201d on the OTC Market, the trading volume for the common stock has historically been very limited. The Company has not listed, and does not currently intend to list, the Company\u2019s common stock for trading on any national securities exchange. Accordingly, we expect the common stock to continue to be illiquid for the foreseeable future. Investors should be aware that an active trading market for the common stock may never develop or be sustained.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock has been volatile. We believe the Company\u2019s stock price will be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics and widespread outbreaks of communicable diseases on passenger demand for air travel, tourism, discretionary spending, consumer behavior and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results from period to period;\n\u2022\nthe repayment, restructuring or refinancing of Air Wisconsin\u2019s debt obligations and our actual or perceived need for additional capital;\n\u2022\nthe illiquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock and the lack of publicly available historical financial information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions about our financial stability generally, and relative to our competitors, and perceptions about the financial stability of Air Wisconsin\u2019s business partners;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions regarding Air Wisconsin\u2019s operating performance, reliability and customer service, and the operating performance, reliability and customer service of its partners and competitors;\n\u2022\nfactors and perceptions impacting the airline industry generally, including future passenger demand for air travel;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant contracts, acquisitions or divestitures by us or Air Wisconsin\u2019s competitors, including any new or amended capacity purchase agreement with United;\n\u2022\nbankruptcies or other financial issues impacting Air Wisconsin\u2019s partners or competitors;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock by the Company or its principal stockholders pursuant to the Company\u2019s publicly announced stock repurchase program or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment impacting Air Wisconsin\u2019s business and industry;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading practices of the Company\u2019s stockholders and other market participants;\n\u2022\nperceptions about securities that are traded on the OTC Market;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the application of accounting guidance; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political or economic conditions.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies across many industries. These changes may occur without regard to the financial condition or operating performance of the affected companies. Accordingly, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with the Company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe concentration of ownership of the Company\u2019s capital stock among a small number of stockholders could allow such stockholders to exert significant influence over the Company\u2019s business plans and strategic objectives, control all matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval, or deter a change in control transaction, any of which could negatively affect the trading price or trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had 54,863,305 shares of common stock outstanding. As of the same date, Amun LLC (\u201cAmun\u201d) held 20,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, representing approximately 28.0% of the fully diluted shares of capital stock of the Company, and Southshore Aircraft Holdings, LLC, through its affiliates (together, \u201cSouthshore\u201d), held shares of the Company\u2019s Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries C Preferred\u201d), which were convertible into 16,500,000 shares of common stock, representing approximately 23.1% of the fully diluted shares of capital stock of the Company (in each case assuming the full conversion of the Series C Preferred into common stock). Following the adjustment of the conversion price of the Series C Preferred effective as of January 7, 2021, pursuant to limitations set forth in the Certificate of Designations, Preferences, and Rights of Series C Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (\u201cCertificate of Designations\u201d), the Series C Preferred remains convertible into an aggregate of 16,500,000 shares of common stock as of the date of filing this Annual Report.\nThe shares of Series C Preferred are generally authorized to vote with the Company\u2019s common stock. As a result, Amun and Southshore collectively control a majority of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock and, therefore, are able to exercise significant influence over the establishment and implementation of the Company\u2019s business plans and strategic objectives, as well as to control all matters submitted to the Company\u2019s stockholders for approval. These stockholders may manage the Company\u2019s business in ways in which certain investors disagree and may be adverse to their interests. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control transaction, depriving the Company\u2019s stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock, or otherwise negatively affecting the trading price or trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nMr. Bartlett, one of the Company\u2019s directors, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock held by Amun due to his status as a member of the board of managers of Amun, and his indirect ownership of 19.6% of the outstanding equity of Amun. In addition, Mr. Bartlett may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares of the Series C Preferred held by Southshore due to his status as a member of the board of managers of Southshore, and his direct or indirect ownership of 19.6% of the outstanding equity of Southshore. Accordingly, Mr. Bartlett may be able to exercise influence over decisions involving the voting or disposition of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. However, Mr. Bartlett does not control voting or investment decisions made by either Amun or Southshore.\nThe Company may suspend its obligation to comply with SEC filing requirements in future periods, and thereby cease filing reports and other information with the SEC, which could have the effect of reducing the trading volume and trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn February 2012, the Company\u2019s predecessor, Harbor Biosciences, Inc., filed a Form 15 with the SEC to deregister its common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. The filing of the Form 15 had the effect of suspending the Company\u2019s obligation, pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, to file reports and other information with the SEC. As a result, prior to the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, the last periodic report filed by the Company was the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. As of January 1, 2020, the Company no longer met the eligibility criteria under Rule 12h-3 of the Exchange Act to suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, requiring the Company to resume filing reports and other information with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.\nThe Company has incurred significant direct and indirect costs, and diversion of management time and resources, as a result of the requirement to comply with certain reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, including those incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, the audit of the financial statements contained within our 2019 Annual Report and this Annual Report in accordance with SEC rules and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) standards, and compliance with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company expects to incur significant additional costs relating to its public reporting obligations, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company would again become eligible to suspend its public reporting obligations if it (i) determines in accordance with applicable SEC rules it has fewer than 300 stockholders of record as of certain points in time, (ii) does not file registration statements pursuant to the Securities Act, and (iii) meets certain other requirements under applicable SEC rules. If the Company becomes eligible to suspend its public reporting obligations in future periods, it may elect to take the actions necessary to suspend those obligations, which would result in the Company no longer being required to file SEC reports. If the Company ceases filing reports and other information with the SEC, it would significantly reduce the amount of publicly available information about the Company and its subsidiaries, which could have the effect of reducing the trading volume and price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn addition, notwithstanding that the Company is currently required to file certain reports and information with the SEC pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company does not have a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company is not required to comply with, and does not intend to follow, certain disclosure requirements typically applicable to public reporting companies, including the requirement to file proxy statements, information statements, tender offer disclosures, and beneficial ownership filings. Accordingly, there may be significantly less information available about the Company, including its governance policies and ownership structure, than is available for other public reporting companies, which could have the effect of further reducing demand for the Company\u2019s common stock and the trading price.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s charter documents and the United capacity purchase agreement might deter acquisition bids, which could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that, among other things:\n\u2022\nprohibit the transfer of any shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock that would result in (i) any person or entity becoming a \u201cFive-Percent Stockholder\u201d (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-T(g)) of the Company\u2019s then-outstanding capital stock, or (ii) an increase in the percentage ownership of any person or entity who is already a \u201cFive-Percent Stockholder\u201d of the Company\u2019s then-outstanding capital stock;\n\u2022\nauthorize the Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to authorize and issue preferred stock with powers, preferences and rights that may be senior to the Company\u2019s common stock, that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock and could also have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the Board of Directors and propose matters to be brought before an annual or special meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company;\n\u2022\ngive the Board of Directors exclusive authority to set the number of directors and increase or decrease the number of directors by one or more resolutions, which may prevent stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize a majority of the Board of Directors to appoint a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which may prevent stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nrestrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders.\nIn addition, the United capacity purchase agreement provides that a change of control of Air Wisconsin results in a termination event under the agreement, pursuant to which United may terminate its relationship with Air Wisconsin.\nThese provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur, or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial, any of which could also adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, limit certain transfers of the Company\u2019s stock in order to preserve the Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, which could have an effect on the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nTo reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes, the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, prohibit certain transfers of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock that could result in adverse tax consequences by impairing the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards. These transfer restrictions are subject to a number of rules and exceptions, and generally may only be repealed or amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. These transfer restrictions apply to the beneficial owners of the shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. The Board of Directors also has the ability to grant certain waivers and to modify certain terms with respect to transfers of the Company\u2019s stock that would otherwise be prohibited. The transfer restrictions contained in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, may limit demand for the Company\u2019s common stock, which may adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur, or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial, any of which could also adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company currently does not intend to pay dividends on its common stock and, consequently, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock may be the appreciation in value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company has not historically paid dividends on shares of its common stock and does not expect to pay dividends on such shares in the foreseeable future. The United capacity purchase agreement, Air Wisconsin\u2019s credit agreements and the agreements with the Treasury for payroll support all contain restrictions that limit Air Wisconsin\u2019s ability to pay, or prohibit it from paying, dividends to the Company. Thus, the source of any future dividends may be limited to cash available from the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions contained in current or future credit agreements or capacity purchase agreements, business prospects and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Consequently, investors should consider that their only opportunity to achieve a positive return on their investment in the Company\u2019s common stock may be the appreciation in value of the Company\u2019s common stock. However, as a result of numerous risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock may not appreciate and may decline significantly.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company may avail itself of reduced disclosure requirements, which may make the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations, and it will continue to be a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as either (i) the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates as of the end of its most recently completed second quarter is less than $250 million or (ii) the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and the annual revenue of the Company is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the Company has relied on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public reporting companies. These exemptions include reduced financial disclosure and disclosure regarding executive compensation. Investors may find the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive because it relies on these exemptions, which could lead to a less active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock and negatively impact the trading price.\nComplying with the requirements of public reporting companies under the Exchange Act, including the requirement for management to assess our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, will increase our operating costs and divert management\u2019s attention from executing our business strategy.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with the SEC with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these various reporting and compliance obligations has substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some of our business activities more difficult or costly, and increased demand on our management team. Significant additional resources and management oversight may be required to maintain and, as required, enhance our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nFurther, the Company\u2019s status as a public reporting company has significantly increased the cost of its director and officer liability insurance, and the Company may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs in the future to obtain similar coverage. These factors, or other risks associated with being a public reporting company, could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of the Board of Directors and executive officers, and it may increase the cost of their services.\nWe have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we could identify additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in future periods.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements included within the 2019 Annual Report, we identified multiple material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWhile we have remediated the previously identified material weaknesses, we may identify additional material weaknesses in future periods, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in preventing or remediating future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. We expect to continue to incur significant costs and diversion of management resources in an effort to enhance our controls and procedures. In addition, these efforts may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our results of operations. Any newly identified material weaknesses could result in material misstatements of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Any such misstatements of our financial statements could lead to restatements of our financial statements, which could result in an adverse impact to our financial results and a decline in the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nShare repurchases could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock, and we cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nThe Company\u2019s board of directors has adopted a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time. Although the Company\u2019s board of directors has authorized the repurchase program, it does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time and for any reason. The number of shares to be repurchased, and the timing of any such repurchases, will depend on a number of factors, including the trading price of the common stock, the Company\u2019s financial performance and liquidity position, general market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. Our ability to repurchase shares may also be limited by restrictive covenants in future borrowing arrangements we may enter into from time to time.\nRepurchases of the Company\u2019s common stock could increase the volatility of the trading price, which could have a negative impact on the trading price. Similarly, the future announcement of the termination or suspension of the repurchase program, or our decision not to utilize the full authorized repurchase amount under the repurchase program, could result in a decrease in the trading price. There can be no assurance that any repurchases we do elect to make will enhance stockholder value because the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares. Although the repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, we cannot guarantee that it will do so.\nThe Company may be at increased risk of securities class action and other litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the price of a company\u2019s securities. If the Company faces such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our compliance with Exchange Act reporting obligations, a significant amount of information regarding our business and operations, including our financial condition and operating results, will become publicly available, which may result in threatened or actual litigation or other disputes with our key constituents. If such claims are successful, our business and results of operations could suffer and, even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish reports about our business, an active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock may not develop.\nThe extent of any trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will depend, in part, on any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We are not currently aware of any analysts who cover the Company nor do we expect any analysts to commence coverage in the foreseeable future. Investors should not purchase the Company\u2019s common stock with the expectation that we will have analyst coverage, or that an active trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will be developed or sustained.", "PERMNO": 85376, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HRBR"}
