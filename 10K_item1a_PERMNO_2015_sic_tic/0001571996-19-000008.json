{"cik": "1571996", "company": "Dell Technologies Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects are subject to a variety of significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ substantially from those Dell Technologies currently expect or seek. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. There are additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that Dell Technologies currently deem to be immaterial that also may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry\nCompetitive pressures may adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 industry unit share position, revenue, and profitability.\nDell Technologies operates in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings. As a result, Dell Technologies faces aggressive product and price competition from both branded and generic competitors. Dell Technologies competes based on its ability to offer to its customers competitive integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features. There is a risk that Dell Technologies\u2019 competitors may provide products that are less costly, perform better or include additional features that are not available with Dell Technologies\u2019 products. There also is a risk that Dell Technologies\u2019 product portfolios may quickly become outdated or that Dell Technologies\u2019 market share may quickly erode. Further, efforts to balance the mix of products and services in order to optimize profitability, liquidity, and growth may put pressure on Dell Technologies\u2019 industry position.\nAs the technology industry continues to expand globally, there may be new and increased competition in different geographic regions. The generally low barriers to entry in the technology industry increase the potential for challenges from new industry competitors. There also may be increased competition from new types of products as the options for mobile and cloud computing solutions increase. In addition, companies with which Dell Technologies has strategic alliances may become competitors in other product areas or current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, all of which may further increase the competitive pressures on Dell Technologies.\nReliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost.\nDell Technologies maintains several single-source or limited-source supplier relationships, including relationships with third-party software providers, either because multiple sources are not readily available or because the relationships are advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. A delay in the supply of a critical single- or limited-source product or component may prevent the timely shipment of the related product in desired quantities or configurations. In addition, Dell Technologies may not be able to replace the functionality provided by third-party software currently offered with its products if that software becomes obsolete, defective, or incompatible with future product versions or is not adequately maintained or updated. Even where multiple sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 operating results.\nDell Technologies obtains many of its products and all of its components from third-party vendors, many of which are located outside of the United States. In addition, significant portions of Dell Technologies\u2019 products are assembled by contract manufacturers, primarily in various locations in Asia. A significant concentration of such outsourced manufacturing currently is performed by only a few of Dell Technologies\u2019 contract manufacturers, often in single locations. Dell Technologies sells components to these contract manufacturers and generates large non-trade accounts receivables, an arrangement that would present a risk of uncollectibility if the financial condition of a contract manufacturer should deteriorate.\nAlthough these relationships generate cost efficiencies, they limit Dell Technologies\u2019 direct control over production. The increasing reliance on vendors subjects Dell Technologies to a greater risk of shortages and reduced control over delivery schedules of components and products, as well as a greater risk of increases in product and component costs. Because Dell Technologies maintains minimal levels of component and product inventories, a disruption in component or product availability could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to satisfy customer needs. In addition, defective parts and products from these vendors could reduce product reliability and harm Dell Technologies\u2019 reputation.\nIf Dell Technologies fails to achieve favorable pricing from vendors, its profitability could be adversely affected.\nDell Technologies\u2019 profitability is affected by its ability to achieve favorable pricing from vendors and contract manufacturers, including through negotiations for vendor rebates, marketing funds, and other vendor funding received in the normal course of business. Because these supplier negotiations are continuous and reflect the evolving competitive environment, the variability in timing and amount of incremental vendor discounts and rebates can affect Dell Technologies\u2019 profitability. The vendor programs may change periodically, potentially resulting in adverse profitability trends if Dell Technologies cannot adjust pricing or variable costs. An inability to establish a cost and product advantage, or determine alternative means to deliver value to customers, may adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 revenue and profitability.\nAdverse global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business and result in reduced net revenue and profitability.\nAs a global company with customers operating in a broad range of businesses and industries, Dell Technologies\u2019 performance is affected by global economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions may negatively affect customer demand for Dell Technologies\u2019 products and services. Such economic conditions could result in postponed or decreased spending amid customer concerns over unemployment, reduced asset values, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, local and state governments, and sovereign nations. Weak or unstable global economic conditions, including due to international trade protection measures, also could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business by contributing to product shortages or delays, insolvency of key suppliers, customer and counterparty insolvencies, increased product costs and associated price increases, reduced global sales and increased challenges in managing Dell Technologies\u2019 operations. Any such effects could have a negative impact on Dell Technologies\u2019 net revenue and profitability.\nDell Technologies\u2019 results of operations may be adversely affected if it fails to successfully execute its growth strategy.\nDell Technologies\u2019 growth strategy involves reaching more customers through direct sales, new distribution channels, expanding relationships with resellers, and augmenting select business areas through targeted acquisitions and other commercial arrangements. As more customers are reached through new distribution channels and expanded reseller relationships, Dell Technologies may fail to manage effectively the increasingly difficult tasks of inventory management and demand forecasting. The ability to implement this growth strategy depends on a successful transitioning of sales capabilities, the successful addition to the breadth of Dell Technologies\u2019 solutions capabilities through selective acquisitions of other businesses, and the effective management of the consequences of these strategic initiatives. If Dell Technologies is unable to meet these challenges, its results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDell Technologies faces risks and challenges in connection with its goal of becoming the leading and essential infrastructure solutions provider and its business strategy.\nDell Technologies expects it will take more time and investment to become the leading and essential infrastructure solutions provider, and the investments it must make are likely to result in lower gross margins and raise its operating expenses and capital expenditures.\nFor Fiscal 2019, Dell Technologies\u2019 Client Solutions business generated approximately 48% of Dell Technologies\u2019 net revenue, and largely relied on PC sales. Revenue from Client Solutions absorbs Dell Technologies\u2019 significant overhead costs and allows for scaled procurement. As a result, Client Solutions remains an important component in Dell Technologies\u2019 ongoing growth strategy. Although Dell Technologies continues to rely on Client Solutions as a critical element of its business, Dell Technologies also anticipates an increasingly challenging demand environment in Client Solutions and intensifying market competition. Current challenges in Client Solutions stem from fundamental changes in the PC market, including a decline in worldwide revenues for desktop and laptop PCs, and lower shipment forecasts for PC products due to a general lengthening of the replacement cycle for PC products and increasing interest in alternative mobile solutions. PC shipments worldwide declined during calendar year 2017, and further deterioration in the PC market may occur. Other challenges include declining margins as demand for PC products shifts from higher-margin premium products to lower-cost and lower-margin products, particularly in emerging markets, and significant and increasing competition from efficient and low-cost manufacturers and from manufacturers of innovative and higher-margin PC products.\nThe challenges Dell Technologies faces include low operating margins for the Infrastructure Solutions Group and, although Client Solutions drives pull-through revenue and cross-selling of ISG solutions, the potential for further margin erosion remains due to intense competition, including emerging competitive pressure from cloud services. Improving the integration of Dell Technologies\u2019 product and service offerings as well as its ability to cross-sell remain a work in progress, as Dell Technologies is in the early stages of integrating its products into solutions and thus far has limited overlap in the base of large customers for the Client Solutions business and the ISG business. In addition, returns from Dell Technologies\u2019 prior acquisitions have been mixed and will require additional investments to reposition the business for growth. As a result of the foregoing challenges, Dell Technologies\u2019 business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nDell Technologies may not successfully implement its acquisition strategy, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and increased costs.\nDell Technologies makes strategic acquisitions of other companies as part of its growth strategy. Dell Technologies could experience unforeseen operating difficulties in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, services, products, personnel, or operations of acquired companies, especially if Dell Technologies is unable to retain the key personnel of an acquired company. Further, future acquisitions may result in a delay or reduction of sales for both Dell Technologies and the acquired company because of customer uncertainty about the continuity and effectiveness of solutions offered by either company and may disrupt Dell Technologies\u2019 existing business by diverting resources and significant management attention that otherwise would be focused on development of the existing business. Acquisitions also may negatively affect Dell Technologies\u2019 relationships with strategic partners if the acquisitions are seen as bringing Dell Technologies into competition with such partners.\nTo complete an acquisition, Dell Technologies may be required to use substantial amounts of cash, engage in equity or debt financings, or enter into credit agreements to secure additional funds. Such debt financings could involve restrictive covenants that might limit Dell Technologies\u2019 capital-raising activities and operating flexibility. Further, an acquisition may negatively affect Dell Technologies\u2019 results of operations because it may expose Dell Technologies to unexpected liabilities, require the incurrence of charges and substantial indebtedness or other liabilities, have adverse tax consequences, result in acquired in-process research and development expenses, or in the future require the amortization, write-down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, or fail to generate a financial return sufficient to offset acquisition costs.\nIn addition, Dell Technologies periodically divests businesses, including businesses that are no longer a part of its strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt Dell Technologies\u2019 business and distract management from other responsibilities, and may result in losses on disposition or continued financial involvement in the divested business, including through indemnification or other financial arrangements, for a period following the transaction, which could adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 financial results.\nIf its cost efficiency measures are not successful, Dell Technologies may become less competitive.\nDell Technologies continues to focus on minimizing operating expenses through cost improvements and simplification of its corporate structure. Certain factors may prevent the achievement of these goals, which may negatively affect Dell Technologies\u2019 competitive position. For example, Dell Technologies may experience delays or unanticipated costs in implementing its cost efficiency plans, which could prevent the timely or full achievement of expected cost efficiencies.\nDell Technologies\u2019 inability to manage solutions and product and services transitions in an effective manner could reduce the demand for Dell Technologies\u2019 solutions, products, and services, and the profitability of Dell Technologies\u2019 operations.\nContinuing improvements in technology result in the frequent introduction of new solutions, products, and services, improvements in product performance characteristics, and short product life cycles. If Dell Technologies fails to manage in an effective manner transitions to new solutions and offerings, the products and services associated with such offerings and customer demand for Dell Technologies\u2019 solutions, products and services could diminish, and Dell Technologies\u2019 profitability could suffer.\nDell Technologies is increasingly sourcing new products and transitioning existing products through its contract manufacturers and manufacturing outsourcing relationships in order to generate cost efficiencies and better serve its customers. The success of product transitions depends on a number of factors, including the availability of sufficient quantities of components at attractive costs. Product transitions also present execution challenges and risks, including the risk that new or upgraded products may have quality issues or other defects.\nFailure to deliver high-quality hardware, software, and services could lead to loss of customers and diminished profitability.\nDell Technologies must identify and address quality issues associated with its hardware, software, and services, many of which include third-party components. Although quality testing is performed regularly to detect quality problems and implement required solutions, failure to identify and correct significant product quality issues before the sale of such products to customers could result in lower sales, increased warranty or replacement expenses and reduced customer confidence, which could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 operating results.\nDell Technologies\u2019 ability to generate substantial non-U.S. net revenue is subject to additional risks and uncertainties.\nSales outside the United States accounted for approximately half of Dell Technologies\u2019 consolidated net revenue for Fiscal 2019. Dell Technologies\u2019 future growth rates and success are substantially dependent on the continued growth of Dell Technologies\u2019 business outside of the United States. Dell Technologies\u2019 international operations face many risks and uncertainties, including varied local economic and labor conditions; political instability; changes in the U.S. and international regulatory environments; the impacts of trade protection measures, including increases in tariffs and trade barriers due to the current geopolitical climate and changes and instability in government policies and international trade arrangements, which could adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to conduct business in non-U.S. markets; tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign operations); copyright levies; and foreign currency exchange rates. Dell Technologies\u2019 international operations could suffer as a result of the process initiated by the United Kingdom to negotiate its exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Depending on the terms of Brexit, Dell Technologies could incur additional operating costs, sustain supply chain disruption, and face new regulatory impediments as the laws and regulations in the United Kingdom diverge from those in the European Union. Any of these factors could negatively affect Dell Technologies\u2019 international business results and prospects for growth.\nDell Technologies\u2019 profitability may be adversely affected by product, customer, and geographic sales mix, and seasonal sales trends.\nDell Technologies\u2019 overall profitability for any period may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of products, customers, and geographic markets reflected in sales for that period, and by seasonal trends. Profit margins vary among products, services, customers, and geographic markets. For instance, services offerings generally have a higher profit margin than consumer products. In addition, parts of Dell Technologies\u2019 business are subject to seasonal sales trends. Among the trends with the most significant impact on Dell Technologies\u2019 operating results, sales to government customers (particularly the U.S. federal government) are typically stronger in Dell Technologies\u2019 third fiscal quarter, sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are often weaker in Dell Technologies\u2019 third fiscal quarter, and sales to consumers are typically strongest during Dell Technologies\u2019 fourth fiscal quarter.\nDell Technologies may lose revenue opportunities and experience gross margin pressure if sales channel participants fail to perform as expected.\nDell Technologies relies on third-party value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, retailers, and other sales channels to complement its direct sales organization in order to reach more end-users globally. Future operating results depend on the performance of sales channel participants and on Dell Technologies\u2019 success in maintaining and developing these relationships. Revenue and gross margins could be negatively affected if the financial condition or operations of channel participants weaken as a result of adverse economic conditions or other business challenges, or if uncertainty regarding the demand for Dell Technologies\u2019 products causes channel participants to reduce their orders for these products. Further, some channel participants may consider the expansion of Dell Technologies\u2019 direct sales initiatives to conflict with their business interests as distributors or resellers of Dell Technologies\u2019 products, which could lead them to reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of such products, or to cease all sales of Dell Technologies\u2019 products.\nDell Technologies\u2019 financial performance could suffer from reduced access to the capital markets by Dell Technologies or some of its customers.\nDell Technologies may access debt and capital sources to provide financing for customers and to obtain funds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and funding of customer receivables. In addition, Dell Technologies maintains customer financing relationships with some companies that rely on access to the debt and capital markets to meet significant funding needs. Any inability of these companies to access such markets could compel Dell Technologies to self-fund transactions with such companies or to forgo customer financing opportunities, which could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 financial performance. The debt and capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption from time to time in the future, which could result in higher credit spreads in such markets and higher funding costs for Dell Technologies. Deterioration in Dell Technologies\u2019 business performance, a credit rating downgrade, volatility in the securitization markets, changes in financial services regulation, or adverse changes in the economy could lead to reductions in the availability of debt financing. In addition, these events could limit Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to continue asset securitizations or other forms of financing from debt or capital sources, reduce the amount of financing receivables that Dell Technologies originates, or negatively affect the costs or terms on which Dell Technologies may be able to obtain capital. Any of these developments could adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 net revenue, profitability, and cash flows.\nWeak economic conditions and additional regulation could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 financial services activities.\nDell Technologies\u2019 financial services activities are negatively affected by adverse economic conditions that contribute to loan delinquencies and defaults. An increase in loan delinquencies and defaults would result in greater net credit losses, which may require Dell Technologies to increase its reserves for customer receivables.\nIn addition, the implementation of new financial services regulation, or the application of existing financial services regulation in countries where Dell Technologies expands its financial services and related supporting activities, could unfavorably affect the profitability and cash flows of Dell Technologies\u2019 consumer financing activities.\nDell Technologies is subject to counterparty default risks.\nDell Technologies has numerous arrangements with financial institutions that include cash and investment deposits, interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts. As a result, Dell Technologies is subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the terms of the arrangement. In times of market distress, a counterparty may default rapidly and without notice, and Dell Technologies may be unable to take action to cover its exposure, either because of lack of contractual ability to do so or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. If one of Dell Technologies\u2019 counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, Dell Technologies\u2019 ability eventually to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty\u2019s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of such a default, Dell Technologies could incur significant losses, which could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe exercise by customers of certain rights under their services contracts with Dell Technologies, or Dell Technologies\u2019 failure to perform as it anticipates at the time it enters into services contracts, could adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 revenue and profitability.\nMany of Dell Technologies\u2019 services contracts allow customers to take actions that may adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 revenue and profitability. These actions include terminating a contract if Dell Technologies\u2019 performance does not meet specified service levels, requesting rate reductions or contract termination, reducing the use of Dell Technologies\u2019 services or terminating a contract early upon payment of agreed fees. In addition, Dell Technologies estimates the costs of delivering the services at the outset of the contract. If Dell Technologies fails to estimate such costs accurately and actual costs significantly exceed estimates, Dell Technologies may incur losses on the services contracts.\nLoss of government contracts could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business.\nContracts with U.S. federal, state, and local governments and with foreign governments are subject to future funding that may affect the extension or termination of programs and to the right of such governments to terminate contracts for convenience or non-appropriation. There is pressure on governments, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Funding reductions or delays could adversely affect public sector demand for Dell Technologies\u2019 products and services. In addition, if Dell Technologies violates legal or regulatory requirements, the applicable government could suspend or disbar Dell Technologies as a contractor, which would unfavorably affect Dell Technologies\u2019 net revenue and profitability.\nDell Technologies\u2019 business could suffer if Dell Technologies does not develop and protect its proprietary intellectual property or obtain or protect licenses to intellectual property developed by others on commercially reasonable and competitive terms.\nIf Dell Technologies or its suppliers are unable to develop or protect desirable technology or technology licenses, Dell Technologies may be prevented from marketing products, may have to market products without desirable features, or may incur substantial costs to redesign products. Dell Technologies also may have to defend or enforce legal actions or pay damages if Dell Technologies is found to have violated the intellectual property of other parties. Although Dell Technologies\u2019 suppliers might be contractually obligated to obtain or protect such licenses and indemnify Dell Technologies against related expenses, those suppliers could be unable to meet their obligations. Although Dell Technologies invests in research and development and obtains additional intellectual property through acquisitions, those activities do not guarantee that Dell Technologies will develop or obtain intellectual property necessary for profitable operations. Costs involved in developing and protecting rights in intellectual property may have a negative impact on Dell Technologies\u2019 business. In addition, Dell Technologies\u2019 operating costs could increase because of copyright levies or similar fees by rights holders and collection agencies in European and other countries.\nInfrastructure disruptions could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business.\nDell Technologies depends on its information technology and manufacturing infrastructure to achieve its business objectives. Natural disasters, manufacturing failures, telecommunications system failures, or defective or improperly installed new or upgraded business management systems could lead to disruptions in this infrastructure. Portions of Dell Technologies\u2019 IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service, or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work. Such disruptions may adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to receive or process orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner or otherwise conduct business in the normal course. Further, portions of Dell Technologies\u2019 services business involve the processing, storage and transmission of data, which also would be negatively affected by such an event. Disruptions in Dell Technologies\u2019 infrastructure could lead to loss of customers and revenue, particularly during a period of heavy demand for Dell Technologies\u2019 products and services. Dell Technologies also could incur significant expense in repairing system damage and taking other remedial measures.\nCyber attacks or other security incidents that disrupt Dell Technologies\u2019 operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary or confidential information about Dell Technologies or Dell Technologies\u2019 workforce, customers or other third parties could disrupt Dell Technologies\u2019 business, harm its reputation, cause Dell Technologies to lose clients and expose Dell Technologies to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation.\nDell Technologies manages, stores, and otherwise processes various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to its operations. In addition, Dell Technologies\u2019 businesses routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data, including sensitive and personally identifiable information, for Dell Technologies\u2019 customers. Criminal or other actors may be able to penetrate Dell Technologies\u2019 security and misappropriate or compromise Dell Technologies\u2019 confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Dell Technologies may experience breaches or other compromises of its information technology systems. Dell reported in November 2018 that it had detected and disrupted unauthorized activity on its network attempting to extract Dell.com customer information. Further, hardware and operating system software and applications that Dell Technologies produces or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of such systems.\nThe costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a security incident could be significant. Remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede Dell Technologies\u2019 sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Dell Technologies could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in Dell Technologies\u2019 products. In addition, breaches of Dell Technologies\u2019 security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about Dell Technologies or its customers or other third parties could expose Dell Technologies, its customers or other third parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory enforcement, litigation and potential liability for Dell Technologies, damage Dell Technologies\u2019 brand and reputation or otherwise harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business. Further, Dell Technologies relies on third-party data management providers and other vendors whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on Dell Technologies.\nDell Technologies is subject to laws, rules and regulations in the United States and other countries relating to the collection, use and security of user and other data. Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting its business subjects it to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require Dell Technologies to notify regulators and customers, employees, or other individuals of a security breach, including in the European Union under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018. Dell Technologies has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations, but despite such expenditures may face regulatory and other legal actions in the event of a data breach or perceived or actual non-compliance with such requirements.\nFailure to hedge effectively Dell Technologies\u2019 exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nDell Technologies utilizes derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Some of these instruments and contracts may involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in Dell Technologies\u2019 financial statements. If Dell Technologies is not successful in monitoring its foreign exchange exposures and conducting an effective hedging program, Dell Technologies\u2019 foreign currency hedging activities may not offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its future results of operations and financial position.\nAdverse legislative or regulatory tax changes, the expiration of tax holidays or favorable tax rate structures, or unfavorable outcomes in tax audits and other tax compliance matters could result in an increase in Dell Technologies\u2019 tax expense or its effective income tax rate.\nChanges in tax laws (including any future Treasury notices or regulations related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017) could adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 operations and profitability. In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial, and administrative changes have been made to tax laws applicable to Dell Technologies and companies similar to Dell Technologies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the \u201cOECD\u201d), an international association of 36 countries, including the United States, has issued guidelines that change long-standing tax principles. This may introduce tax uncertainty as countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to occur, and such changes may adversely affect Dell Technologies\u2019 tax liability.\nPortions of Dell Technologies\u2019 operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time. Many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met, or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays are not extended, or if Dell Technologies fails to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, its effective tax rate would be affected. Dell Technologies\u2019 effective tax rate also could be impacted if Dell Technologies\u2019 geographic sales mix changes. In addition, any actions by Dell Technologies to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which it has not previously provided for U.S. taxes may affect the effective tax rate.\nDell Technologies is continually under audit in various tax jurisdictions. Dell Technologies may not be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits. An unfavorable outcome in certain of these matters could result in a substantial increase in Dell Technologies\u2019 tax expense. In addition, Dell Technologies\u2019 provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nDell Technologies\u2019 profitability could suffer from any impairment of its portfolio investments.\nDell Technologies invests a significant portion of its available funds in a portfolio consisting primarily of debt securities of various types and maturities pending the deployment of these funds in Dell Technologies\u2019 business. Dell Technologies\u2019 earnings performance could suffer from any impairment of its investments. Dell Technologies\u2019 portfolio securities generally are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded in Dell Technologies\u2019 financial statements at fair value. If any such investments experience declines in market price and it is determined that such declines are other than temporary, Dell Technologies may have to recognize in earnings the decline in the fair market value of such investments below their cost or carrying value.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business and result in substantial costs.\nDell Technologies is involved in various claims, suits, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, as well as those that arose in connection with the Class V transaction, including those described elsewhere in this report. Additional legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve stockholder, consumer, regulatory, compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax and other issues on a global basis. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to Dell Technologies\u2019 business. Dell Technologies could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could adversely affect its operating results or cash flows in a particular period. In addition, Dell Technologies\u2019 business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against it by any third party is successful, or if Dell Technologies fails to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions.\nDell Technologies is incurring increased costs and is subject to additional regulations and requirements as a public company, and Dell Technologies\u2019 management is required to devote substantial time to compliance matters, which could lower Dell Technologies\u2019 profits or make it more difficult to run its business.\nSince it became a public company in June 2016, Dell Technologies has been incurring significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that it had not incurred as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements and costs of recruiting and retaining non-executive directors. Dell Technologies also is incurring costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for financial reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. The increased Dell Technologies\u2019 legal and financial compliance costs have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. Dell Technologies\u2019 management has to devote substantial time to ensuring that it complies with all of these requirements. Laws and regulations affecting public company directors and executive officers could make it more difficult for Dell Technologies to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors or its board committees or as its executive officers. Further, if Dell Technologies is unable to satisfy its obligations as a public company, the Class C Common Stock could be subject to delisting from the NYSE and Dell Technologies could be subject to fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nCompliance requirements of current or future environmental and safety laws, or other laws, may increase costs, expose Dell Technologies to potential liability and otherwise harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business.\nDell Technologies\u2019 operations are subject to environmental and safety regulations in all areas in which Dell Technologies conducts business. Product design and procurement operations must comply with new and future requirements relating to climate change laws and regulations, materials composition, sourcing, energy efficiency and collection, recycling, treatment, transportation, and disposal of electronics products, including restrictions on mercury, lead, cadmium, lithium metal, lithium ion and other substances. If Dell Technologies fails to comply with applicable rules and regulations regarding the transportation, source, use and sale of such regulated substances, Dell Technologies could be subject to liability. The costs and timing of costs under environmental and safety laws are difficult to predict, but could have an adverse impact on Dell Technologies\u2019 business.\nIn addition, Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and are also subject to export controls, customs and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws or export control, customs or economic sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDell Technologies also is subject to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. Dell Technologies will incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in Dell Technologies\u2019 products. Further, Dell Technologies may face reputational harm if its customers or other Dell Technologies stakeholders conclude that Dell Technologies is unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in its products.\nArmed hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters, or public health issues could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business.\nArmed hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters or public health issues, whether in the United States or abroad, could cause damage or disruption to Dell Technologies or Dell Technologies\u2019 suppliers and customers, or could create political or economic instability, any of which could harm Dell Technologies\u2019 business. For example, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and severe flooding in Thailand which occurred during fiscal year 2012 caused damage to infrastructure and factories that disrupted the supply chain for a variety of components used in Dell\u2019s products. Any such future events could cause a decrease in demand for Dell Technologies\u2019 products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products or for suppliers to deliver components, and create delays and inefficiencies in Dell Technologies\u2019 supply chain.\nDell Technologies is highly dependent on the services of Michael S. Dell, its Chief Executive Officer, and its success depends on the ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees.\nDell Technologies is highly dependent on the services of Michael S. Dell, its Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder. If Dell Technologies loses the services of Mr. Dell, Dell Technologies may not be able to locate a suitable or qualified replacement, and Dell Technologies may incur additional expenses to recruit a replacement, which could severely disrupt Dell Technologies\u2019 business and growth. Further, Dell Technologies relies on key personnel, including other members of its executive leadership team, to support its business and increasingly complex product and services offerings. Dell Technologies may not be able to attract, retain and motivate the key professional, technical, marketing and staff resources needed.\nDell Technologies\u2019 substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition.\nDell Technologies and its subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which require significant interest and other debt service payments. As of February 1, 2019, Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries had approximately $54.2 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness. As of the same date, Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries also had an additional $5.6 billion available for borrowing under its revolving credit facilities.\nDell Technologies\u2019 substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nDell Technologies must use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on its senior credit facilities, its senior secured and senior unsecured notes, and its other indebtedness, which reduces funds available to Dell Technologies for other purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions;\n\u2022\nDell Technologies\u2019 ability to refinance such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nDell Technologies is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because Dell Technologies\u2019 senior credit facilities have variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nDell Technologies\u2019 leverage may be greater than that of some of its competitors, which may put Dell Technologies at a competitive disadvantage and reduce Dell Technologies\u2019 flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions; and\n\u2022\nDell Technologies may be unable to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in its senior credit facilities, the notes, and other indebtedness that limit Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to incur additional debt, make investments and sell assets, which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have an adverse effect on Dell Technologies\u2019 business and prospects and could force it into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDell Technologies and its subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in Dell Technologies\u2019 and its subsidiaries\u2019 credit facilities and the indentures that govern the notes. If new indebtedness is added to the debt levels of Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries, the related risks that Dell Technologies now faces could intensify. Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to access additional funding under its revolving credit facilities will depend upon, among other factors, the absence of a default under either such facility, including any default arising from a failure to comply with the related covenants. If Dell Technologies is unable to comply with its covenants under its revolving credit facilities, Dell Technologies\u2019 liquidity may be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, when it believes it is advantageous to do so, Dell Technologies may seek to reduce its leverage by repaying certain of its indebtedness before the maturity dates of such indebtedness. Dell Technologies may be unable to generate operating cash flows and other cash necessary to achieve a level of debt reduction that will significantly enhance its credit quality and reduce the risks associated with its substantial indebtedness.\nAs of February 1, 2019, approximately $17.9 billion of Dell Technologies\u2019 debt was variable-rate debt and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $179 million in annual interest expense on such debt. Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to meet its expenses, to remain in compliance with its covenants under its debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of its debt depends on, among other factors, Dell Technologies\u2019 operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. Dell Technologies is not able to control many of these factors. Given current industry and economic conditions, Dell Technologies\u2019 cash flow may not be sufficient to allow Dell Technologies to pay principal and interest on its debt and meet its other obligations.\nThe financial performance of Dell Technologies is affected by the financial performance of VMware, Inc.\nBecause Dell Technologies consolidates the financial results of VMware, Inc. in its results of operations, its financial performance is affected by the financial performance of VMware, Inc. VMware, Inc.\u2019s financial performance may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand, adoption rates, sales cycles (which have been increasing in length), and pricing levels for VMware, Inc.\u2019s products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and in the timing of its purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognizing revenues in any given quarter, which can be affected by a number of factors, including product announcements, beta programs and product promotions that can cause revenue recognition of certain orders to be deferred until future products to which customers are entitled become available;\n\u2022\nthe timing of announcements or releases of new or upgraded products and services by VMware, Inc. or by its competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of business realignment plans and restructuring charges;\n\u2022\nVMware, Inc.\u2019s ability to maintain scalable internal systems for reporting, order processing, license fulfillment, product delivery, purchasing, billing and general accounting, among other functions;\n\u2022\nVMware, Inc.\u2019s ability to control costs, including its operating expenses;\n\u2022\ncredit risks of VMware, Inc.\u2019s distributors, who account for a significant portion of VMware, Inc.\u2019s product revenues and accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nVMware, Inc.\u2019s ability to process sales at the end of the quarter;\n\u2022\nseasonal factors, such as the end of fiscal period budget expenditures by VMware, Inc.\u2019s customers and the timing of holiday and vacation periods;\n\u2022\nrenewal rates and the amounts of the renewals for enterprise agreements, as the original terms of such agreements expire;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of software development costs that may be capitalized;\n\u2022\nunplanned events that could affect market perception of the quality or cost-effectiveness of VMware, Inc.\u2019s products and solutions; and\n\u2022\nVMware, Inc.\u2019s ability to predict accurately the degree to which customers will elect to purchase its subscription-based offerings in place of licenses to its on-premises offerings.\nDell Technologies\u2019 pension plan assets are subject to market volatility.\nThrough the EMC merger, Dell Technologies assumed a noncontributory defined pension plan, which was originally part of the EMC legacy acquisition of Data General. The plan\u2019s assets are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. As of February 1, 2019 the expected long-term rate of return on the plan\u2019s assets was 5.75%, which represented the average of the expected long-term rates of return weighted by the plan\u2019s assets as of February 1, 2019. As market conditions permit, Dell Technologies expects to continue to shift the asset allocation to lower the percentage of investments in equities and increase the percentage of investments in long-duration fixed-income securities. The effect of such a change could result in a reduction in the long-term rate of return on plan assets and an increase in future pension expense. As of February 1, 2019, the ten-year historical rate of return on plan assets was 10.66%, and the inception-to-date return on plan assets was 9.40%. Should Dell Technologies not achieve the expected rate of return on the plan\u2019s assets or if the plan experiences a decline in the fair value of its assets, Dell Technologies may be required to contribute assets to the plan, which could materially adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Class C Common Stock\nThe price of Dell Technologies\u2019 Class C Common Stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in the Class C Common Stock to decline.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies historically have experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of Dell Technologies\u2019 Class C Common Stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of the following factors, among others:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by Dell Technologies or its competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in how customers perceive the effectiveness of Dell Technologies\u2019 products, services or technologies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in Dell Technologies\u2019 quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in Dell Technologies\u2019 financial guidance or estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in the information technology industry in particular;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of the Class C Common Stock or the size of the trading market for the Class C Common Stock held by non-affiliates;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving Dell Technologies, its industry, or both, including disputes or other developments relating to Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to obtain patent protection for its processes and technologies and protect its other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and other jurisdictions in which Dell Technologies operates;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political factors, including market conditions in Dell Technologies\u2019 industry or the industries of its clients;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of the Class C Common Stock; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key employees.\nIn addition, if the market for stock of companies in the technology industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of the Class C Common Stock could decline for reasons unrelated to Dell Technologies\u2019 business, results of operations or financial condition. The market price of the Class C Common Stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in Dell Technologies\u2019 industry, even if these events do not directly affect Dell Technologies.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation often has been brought against that company. If Dell Technologies\u2019 stock price is volatile, Dell Technologies may become the target of securities litigation, which could cause it to incur substantial costs and divert its management\u2019s attention and resources from Dell Technologies\u2019 business.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports or cease to publish research reports about Dell Technologies and its business or prospects, the market price or trading volume of the Class C Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for the Class C Common Stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about Dell Technologies and its business or prospects. Dell Technologies does not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts covering Dell Technologies downgrades the Class C Common Stock, expresses an adverse change of opinion regarding the Class C Common Stock or publishes inaccurate research about Dell Technologies, the market price of the Class C Common Stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of Dell Technologies or fails to publish reports on it on a regular basis, Dell Technologies could lose following in the financial markets, which could cause the market price or trading volume of the Class C Common Stock to decline.\nDell Technologies\u2019 multi-class common stock structure with different voting rights may adversely affect the trading price of the Class C Common Stock.\nEach share of Dell Technologies\u2019 Class A Common Stock and each share of Dell Technologies\u2019 Class B Common Stock has ten votes, while each share of Dell Technologies\u2019 Class C Common Stock has one vote. Based on their ownership of Dell Technologies\u2019 common stock as of February 1, 2019, because of these disparate voting rights, the MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders and the SLP stockholders collectively held common stock representing approximately 96.4% of the total voting power of Dell Technologies\u2019 outstanding common stock. The limited ability of holders of the Class C Common Stock to influence matters requiring stockholder approval may adversely affect the market price of the Class C Common Stock.\nIn addition, in 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones changed their eligibility criteria to exclude new companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to certain indices. FTSE Russell instituted a requirement that new and, beginning in September 2022, existing constituents of its indices have greater than 5% of their voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, whereas S&P Dow Jones announced that companies with multiple share classes, such as ours, will not be eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Other stock indices might adopt similar requirements in the future. Under the current criteria, Dell Technologies\u2019 multi-class capital structure makes it ineligible for inclusion in any of these indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that track these indices will not invest in the Class C Common Stock. It is unclear what effect, if any, exclusion from the indices will have on the valuations of the affected publicly-traded companies. It is possible that such policies may depress the valuations of public companies excluded from these indices compared to valuations of companies that are included.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of a substantial amount of shares of the Class C Common Stock could depress the trading price of the Class C Common Stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of the Class C Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of the Class C Common Stock, which could make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares of Class C Common Stock at a time and price that they consider appropriate. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also could impair Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price Dell Technologies deems appropriate, and Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to use Class C Common Stock as consideration for acquisitions of other businesses, investments, or other corporate purposes. As of February 1, 2019, Dell Technologies had a total of approximately 172 million shares of Class C Common Stock outstanding.\nAs of February 1, 2019, the 406,290,710 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock held by the MD stockholders and the MSD Partners stockholders, and the 136,986,858 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock held by the SLP stockholders were convertible into shares of Class C Common Stock at any time on a one-to-one basis. Although the MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and SLP stockholders generally are subject to transfer restrictions that prevent their sale or other transfer of common stock until June 27, 2019, thereafter such shares, upon any conversion into shares of Class C Common Stock, will be eligible for resale in the public market pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, subject to volume, manner of sale, and other limitations under Rule 144.\nIn addition, as of February 1, 2019, Dell Technologies had entered into a registration rights agreement with holders of 406,483,978 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (which are convertible into shares of Class C Common Stock), holders of all of the 136,986,858 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (which are convertible into shares of Class C Common Stock) and holders of 18,181,818 outstanding shares of Class C Common Stock, pursuant to which Dell Technologies has granted such holders and their permitted transferees shelf, demand and/or piggyback registration rights with respect to such shares. Registration of those shares under the Securities Act would permit such holders to sell the shares into the public market.\nFurther, as of February 1, 2019, Dell Technologies had 45,097,158 shares of Class C Common Stock that may be issued upon the exercise, vesting or settlement of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units or deferred stock units under Dell Technologies\u2019 stock incentive plans, all of which would have been, upon issuance, eligible for sale in the public market, subject to expiration or waiver of applicable contractual transfer restrictions that, subject to certain exceptions, are scheduled to expire beginning on June 27, 2019, and to terminate on December 27, 2020, and an additional 32,050,556 shares of Class C Common Stock that have been authorized and reserved for issuance in relation to potential future awards under the stock incentive plans. Dell Technologies also may issue additional options in the future that may be exercised for additional shares of Class C Common Stock and additional restricted stock units or deferred stock units that may vest. Dell Technologies expects that all shares of Class C Common Stock issuable with respect to such awards will be registered under one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and available for sale in the open market.\nDell Technologies\u2019 issuance of additional Class C Common Stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, its stock incentive plans, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nThe Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation authorizes Dell Technologies to issue up to 7,900,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock and up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by Dell Technologies\u2019 board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable law, Dell Technologies may issue shares of Class C Common Stock or securities convertible into Class C Common Stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, Dell Technologies\u2019 stock incentive plans, or otherwise. Dell Technologies may issue additional shares of Class C Common Stock from time to time at a discount to the market price of the Class C Common Stock at the time of issuance. Any issuance of Class C Common Stock could result in substantial dilution to Dell Technologies\u2019 existing stockholders and cause the market price of the Class C Common Stock to decline.\nDell Technologies does not presently intend to pay any dividends on the Class C Common Stock.\nDell Technologies does not presently intend to pay cash dividends on the Class C Common Stock. Accordingly, investors may have to rely on sales of the Class C Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any gains on their investment in the Class C Common Stock.\nDell Technologies\u2019 operations are conducted almost entirely through its subsidiaries and its ability to generate cash to make future dividend payments, if any, is highly dependent on the cash flows and the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. To the extent that Dell Technologies determines in the future to pay dividends on the Class C Common Stock, the terms of existing and future agreements governing Dell Technologies\u2019 or its subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness, including the existing credit facilities of, and existing senior notes issued by, subsidiaries of Dell Technologies, may significantly restrict the ability of Dell Technologies\u2019 subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make distributions or transfer assets to Dell Technologies, as well as the ability of Dell Technologies to pay dividends to holders of its common stock. In addition, Delaware law imposes requirements that may restrict Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to pay dividends to holders of its common stock.\nProvisions of Dell Technologies\u2019 organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire Dell Technologies even if doing so may be beneficial to Dell Technologies\u2019 stockholders.\nCertain provisions of Dell Technologies\u2019 certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of Dell Technologies that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nlimitations on who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors and for proposals for other businesses;\n\u2022\nthe existence of authorized and unissued stock, including \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by the board of directors without approval of the holders of the common stock to persons friendly to Dell Technologies\u2019 management, thereby protecting the continuity of Dell Technologies\u2019 management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of Dell Technologies;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that any stockholder written consent be signed by holders of a majority of Dell Technologies\u2019 common stock beneficially owned by the MD stockholders and holders of a majority of Dell Technologies\u2019 common stock beneficially owned by the SLP stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that (1) the holders of the Class A Common Stock, voting separately as a series, (2) the holders of the Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a series, and (3) the MD stockholders and SLP stockholders, in each case, so long as they own any common stock, approve amendments to certain provisions of Dell Technologies\u2019 certificate of incorporation, including provisions related to authorized capital stock and the size and structure of the board of directors.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, Dell Technologies is subject to provisions of Delaware law that may deter a takeover attempt that its stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of Dell Technologies, including actions that its stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of its common stock, including the Class C Common Stock. These provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for Dell Technologies\u2019 stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause Dell Technologies to take other corporate actions that may be supported by its stockholders.\nDell Technologies\u2019 board of directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of preferred stock in additional series without stockholder approval.\nThe Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors, without the approval of Dell Technologies\u2019 stockholders, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, subject to limitations prescribed by applicable law, rules, and regulations and the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, as shares of preferred stock in series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof. The powers, preferences, and rights of these additional series of preferred stock may be senior to or on parity with Dell Technologies\u2019 series of common stock, including the Class C Common Stock, which may reduce the value of the Class C Common Stock.\nDell Technologies is controlled by the MD stockholders, and the MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders collectively own a substantial majority of its common stock.\nBy reason of their ownership of Class A Common Stock possessing a majority of the aggregate votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares of Dell Technologies\u2019 common stock voting together as a single class, the MD stockholders have the ability to approve any matter submitted to the vote of all of the outstanding shares of the common stock voting together as a single class.\nThrough their control of Dell Technologies, the MD stockholders are able to control actions to be taken by Dell Technologies, including actions related to the election of directors of Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries (including VMware, Inc. and its subsidiaries), amendments to Dell Technologies\u2019 organizational documents and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers, sales of substantially all of Dell Technologies\u2019 assets, distributions of Dell Technologies\u2019 assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, and any incurrence of liens on Dell Technologies\u2019 assets. For example, although the Dell Technologies bylaws provide that the number of directors will be fixed by resolution of the board of directors, the stockholders of Dell Technologies may adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws in accordance with Section 109 of the Delaware General Corporation. Through their control of Dell Technologies, the MD stockholders may therefore amend the bylaws to change the number of directors (within the limits of the certificate of incorporation), notwithstanding any determination by the board of directors regarding board size.\nFurther, as of February 1, 2019, the MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders collectively beneficially owned 76.4% of Dell Technologies\u2019 outstanding common stock. This concentration of ownership together with the disparate voting rights of Dell Technologies\u2019 common stock may delay or deter possible changes in control of Dell Technologies, which may reduce the value of an investment in the Class C Common Stock. So long as the MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders continue to own common stock representing a significant amount of the combined voting power of Dell Technologies\u2019 outstanding common stock, even if such amount is, individually or in the aggregate, less than 50%, such stockholders will continue to be able to strongly influence Dell Technologies\u2019 decisions. Further, the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders, respectively, have the right to nominate a number of individuals for election as Group I Directors which is equal to the percentage of the total voting power for the regular election of directors beneficially owned by the MD stockholders or by the SLP stockholders multiplied by the number of directors then on the board of directors who are not members of the audit committee, rounded up to the nearest whole number. In addition, so long as the MD stockholders or the SLP stockholders each beneficially own at least 5% of all outstanding shares of the common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, each of the MD stockholders or the SLP stockholders, as applicable, are entitled to nominate at least one individual for election as a Group I Director.\nThe MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders and their respective affiliates may have interests that conflict with the interests of other stockholders or those of Dell Technologies.\nIn the ordinary course of their business activities, the MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders and their respective affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with interests of other stockholders or those of Dell Technologies. The Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation provides that none of the MD stockholders, MSD Partners, L.P., the MSD Partners stockholders, Silver Lake Partners III, L.P. and the SLP stockholders, any of their respective affiliates or any director or officer of the Company who is also a director, officer, employee, managing director or other affiliate of MSD Partners, L.P. or Silver Lake Partners III, L.P. (other than Michael Dell) have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which Dell Technologies operates. The MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to Dell Technologies\u2019 business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to Dell Technologies. In addition, such stockholders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance the value of their investment in Dell Technologies, even though such transactions might involve risks to other stockholders.\nBecause Dell Technologies is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NYSE rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and relies on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, holders of Class C Common Stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nDell Technologies is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NYSE rules because the MD stockholders hold common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power in the election of directors. As a controlled company, Dell Technologies may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements under NYSE rules, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\nDell Technologies have a board that is composed of a majority of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under NYSE rules;\n\u2022\nDell Technologies have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nDell Technologies have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nDell Technologies is utilizing these exemptions and expects to continue to utilize the exemptions. As a result, a majority of the directors on the board of directors are not independent directors as defined under NYSE rules and none of the committees of the board of directors, other than the audit committee, consists entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, holders of Class C Common Stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE\u2019s corporate governance requirements.\nThe Dell Technologies board of directors has formed an executive committee of the board consisting entirely of directors designated by the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders, and has delegated a substantial portion of the power and authority of the board of directors to the executive committee.\nThe board of directors has formed an executive committee of the board consisting entirely of directors designated by the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders (none of whom have been affirmatively determined by the board of directors to be independent directors), and has delegated a substantial portion of the power and authority of the board of directors to the executive committee. The executive committee has been delegated the board\u2019s power and authority, subject to specified limits, to review and approve, with respect to Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries, among other matters, acquisitions and dispositions, the annual budget and business plan, the incurrence of indebtedness, entry into material commercial agreements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, and the commencement and settlement of material litigation. In addition, as of the date of this report, the executive committee acted as the compensation committee of the board of directors. The interests of the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders with respect to the foregoing matters may differ materially from the interests of the holders of Class C Common Stock.\nThe Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation designates a state court of the State of Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by Dell Technologies\u2019 stockholders, which could limit the ability of the holders of Class C Common Stock to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Dell Technologies or with directors, officers, or the controlling stockholders of Dell Technologies.\nUnder the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation, unless Dell Technologies consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum will be a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Dell Technologies;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or stockholder of Dell Technologies to Dell Technologies or Dell Technologies\u2019 stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against Dell Technologies or any director or officer or stockholder of Dell Technologies arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Dell Technologies; or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against Dell Technologies or any director or officer or stockholder of Dell Technologies governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThese provisions of the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation could limit the ability of the holders of the Class C Common Stock to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Dell Technologies or with directors, officers, or the controlling stockholders of Dell Technologies, which may discourage such lawsuits against Dell Technologies and its directors, officers, and stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of its organizational documents inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, Dell Technologies may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The exclusive forum provisions of the certificate of incorporation are not intended to apply to claims under the federal securities laws.\nDell Technologies is obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to do so may adversely affect investor confidence in Dell Technologies and, as a result, the value of the Class C Common Stock.\nDell Technologies is required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to furnish an annual report by management on, among other matters, its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by Dell Technologies\u2019 management in its report. Dell Technologies also is required to disclose significant changes made in its internal control over financial reporting. In addition, Dell Technologies\u2019 independent registered public accounting firm is required to express an opinion each year as to the effectiveness of Dell Technologies\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. The process of designing, implementing, and testing internal control over financial reporting is time-consuming, costly, and complicated.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process of its internal controls, if Dell Technologies identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, Dell Technologies will be unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective. Dell Technologies may experience material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit Dell Technologies\u2019 ability to issue accurate reports of its financial condition or results of operations. If Dell Technologies is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if Dell Technologies\u2019 independent registered public accounting firm determines that Dell Technologies has a material weakness or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of Dell Technologies\u2019 financial reports, the market price of the Class C Common Stock could decline and Dell Technologies could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in Dell Technologies\u2019 internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, also could restrict future access to the capital markets by Dell Technologies or its subsidiaries.", "PERMNO": 18267, "SIC": 3571, "TIC": "DELL"}
