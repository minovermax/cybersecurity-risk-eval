{"cik": "1640384", "company": "LM FUNDING AMERICA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline.\nBecause of the nature of our business, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our results may fluctuate as a result of the following factors:\n(i)\nthe timing and amount of collections on our Account portfolio;\n(ii)\nour inability to identify and acquire additional Accounts;\n(iii)\na decline in the value of our Account portfolio recoveries;\n(iv)\na decline in the number of travel insurance policies sold;\n(v)\nan increase in the underwriting costs associated with underwriting travel insurance policies;\n(vi)\nincreases in operating expenses associated with the growth of our operations; and\n(vii)\ngeneral, economic and real estate market conditions.\nAny future acquisitions that we make may prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources.\nWe may seek to grow through acquisitions of related businesses. Such acquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance, including:\n(i)\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our everyday business activities;\n(ii)\nthe assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n(iii)\nthe contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of, and other unanticipated problems arising in, the acquired business; and\n(iv)\nthe need to expand our management, administration and operational systems to accommodate such acquired business.\nIf we make such acquisitions we cannot predict whether:\n(i)\nwe will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses into our business;\n(ii)\nwe will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions; or\n(iii)\nthere will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with such acquisitions.\nIn addition, future acquisitions by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of additional debt, and the recognition of significant charges for depreciation and amortization related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAlthough we have no definitive plans or intentions to make acquisitions of related businesses, we continuously evaluate such potential acquisitions. However, we have not reached any agreement or arrangement with respect to any particular acquisition and we may not be able to complete any acquisitions on favorable terms or at all.\nThe recent coronavirus outbreak could have an adverse effect on our business.\nConcerns are rapidly growing about the global outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). The virus has spread rapidly across the globe, including the U.S. The pandemic is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy as federal, state and local governments react to this public health crisis, which has created significant uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the potential adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy, our customers and the legal system which we use to collect for our customers.\nWe believe that the wide-spread unemployment crisis will impact the ability of community associations to pay vendors and provide basic services and amenities to their residents. Our funding products fill the void created when homeowners do not pay their dues. We are then able to work with delinquent homeowners to establish payment plans to save their homes from foreclosure. Homeowners\u2019 inability to pay their associations creates an opportunity to sell our products. However, homeowners\u2019 continued inability to pay their associations\u2019 assessments due to unemployment resulting from a pandemic could adversely affect our revenues and profitability until unemployment subsides.\nAs the pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine may continue. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak within the U.S., the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nOur investments in other businesses and entry into new business ventures may adversely affect our operations.\nWe have made and may continue to make investments in companies or commence operations in businesses and industries that are not identical to those with which we have historically been successful. If these investments or arrangements are not successful, our earnings could be materially adversely affected by increased expenses and decreased revenues.\nOur organizational documents and Delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our Board of Directors and management.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock. Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. In addition, our directors serve staggered terms of one to three years each and, as such, at any given annual meeting of our stockholders, only a portion of our Board of Directors may be considered for election, which may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our Board of Directors at certain annual meetings and may entrench our management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals. The ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current Board of Directors.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. We had 3,320,261 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of April 15, 2020. We may issue additional shares in connection with our business and may grant stock options to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our stock option plans or warrants to third parties. If a significant portion of these shares were sold in the public market, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nCraven House Capital North America, LLC owns 25% of our company and may exert significant influence over our company, reducing the influence of our other stockholders.\nAs of April 14, 2020, Craven House Capital North America, LLC (\u201cCraven\u201d) beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, Craven may be able to influence the actions that require stockholder approval, including the election of a majority of our directors and the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval. In addition, Craven\u2019s influence could deter or preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and consequently materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Specialty Finance Business\nWe may not be able to purchase Accounts at favorable prices, or on sufficiently favorable terms, or at all.\nOur success depends upon the continued availability of Association Accounts. The availability of Accounts at favorable prices and on terms acceptable to us depends on a number of factors outside our control, including:\n(i)\nthe status of the economy and real estate market in markets which we have operations may become so strong that delinquent Accounts do not occur in sufficient quantities to efficiently acquire them;\n(ii)\nthe perceived need of Associations to sell their Accounts to us as opposed to taking other measures to solve budget problems such as increasing assessments; and\n(iii)\ncompetitive pressures from law firms, collections agencies, and others to produce more revenue for Associations than we can provide through the purchase of Accounts.\nIn addition, our ability to purchase Accounts, in particular with respect to our original product, is reliant on state statutes allowing for a Super Lien Amount to protect our principal investment; any change of those statutes and elimination of the priority of the Super Lien Amount, particularly in Florida, could have an adverse effect on our ability to purchase Accounts. If we were unable to purchase Accounts at favorable prices or on terms acceptable to us, or at all, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to recover sufficient amounts on our Accounts to recover charges to the Accounts for interest and late fees necessary to fund our operations.\nWe acquire and collect on the delinquent receivables of Associations. Since Account debtors are third parties that we have little to no information about, we cannot predict when any given Account will pay off or how much it will yield. In order to operate profitably over the long term, we must continually purchase and collect on a sufficient volume of Accounts to generate revenue that exceeds our costs.\nWe are subject to intense competition seeking to provide a collection solution to Associations for delinquent Accounts.\nLawyers, collection agencies, and other direct and indirect competitors vying to collect on Accounts all propose to solve the problem delinquent Accounts pose to Associations. Additionally, Associations and their management companies sometimes try to solve their delinquent Account problems in house, without the assistance of third-party collection agencies. An Account that an Association attempts to collect through any of these other options is an Account we cannot purchase and collect. We compete on the basis of reputation, industry experience, performance and financing dollars. Some of these competitors have greater contacts with Associations, greater financial resources and access to capital, more personnel, wider geographic presence and greater resources than we have. In addition, we expect the entry of new competitors in the future given the relatively new nature of the market in which we operate. Aggressive pricing by our competitors could raise the price of acquiring and purchasing Accounts above levels that we are willing to pay, which could reduce the number of Accounts suitable for us to purchase or if purchased by us, reduce the profits, if any, generated by such Accounts. If we are unable to purchase Accounts at favorable prices or at all, the revenues generated by us and our earnings could be materially reduced.\nWe are dependent upon third-party law firms to service our Accounts.\nAlthough we utilize our proprietary software and in-house staff to track, monitor, and direct the collection of our Accounts, we depend upon third-party law firms to perform the collection work. As a result, we are dependent upon the efforts of our third-party law firms, particularly Business Law Group, P.A. (\u201cBLG\u201d) to service and collect our Accounts. As of December 31, 2019, BLG was responsible for servicing over 98% of our Accounts. Our revenues and profitability could be materially affected if:\n(i)\nour agreements with the third-party law firms we use are terminated and we are not able to secure replacement law firms or direct payments from Account debtors to our replacement law firms;\n(ii)\nour relationships with our law firms adversely change;\n(iii)\nour law firms fail to adequately perform their obligations; or\n(iv)\ninternal changes at such law firms occur, such as loss of staff who service us.\nIf we are unable to access external sources of financing, we may not be able to fund and grow our operations.\nWe depend upon loans from external sources from time to time to fund and expand our operations. Our ability to grow our business is dependent on our access to additional financing and capital resources. The failure to obtain financing and capital as needed would limit our ability to purchase Accounts and achieve our growth plans.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness from time to time in connection with the purchase of Accounts and could be subject to risks associated with incurring such indebtedness.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness from time to time in connection with the purchase of Accounts and could be subject to risks associated with incurring such indebtedness, including:\n(i)\nwe could be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs and, as a result, we would have less funds available for operations, future acquisitions of Accounts, and other purposes;\n(ii)\nit may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds through financings, if such funds are available at all;\n(iii)\nwe could be more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general economic conditions; and\n(iv)\nif we default under any of our existing credit facilities or if our creditors demand payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments.\nWe may encounter difficulties managing changes in our business including cyclical growth and declines, which could disrupt our operations, and there is no assurance that any such growth (if experienced) can be sustained.\nFrom time to time since our inception, we have experienced periods of significant growth and declines. Although there is no assurance that we will again experience periods of significant growth or continued declines in the future, if we do, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our changing operations effectively or that we will be able to maintain or accelerate our growth, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and control expenses. Future growth will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n(i)\nthe effective and timely initiation and development of relationships with law firms, management companies, accounting firms and other trusted advisors of Associations willing to sell Accounts;\n(ii)\nour ability to continue to develop our proprietary software for use in other markets and with different products;\n(iii)\nour ability to maintain the collection of Accounts efficiently;\n(iv)\nthe recruitment, motivation and retention of qualified personnel both in our principal office and in new markets;\n(v)\nour ability to successfully implement our business strategy in states outside of the state of Florida; and\n(vi)\nour successful implementation of enhancements to our operational and financial systems.\nDue to our limited financial resources and the limited experience and size of our management team, we may not be able to effectively manage the growth of our business. Significant growth may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business strategy or disrupt our operations.\nGovernment regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our Accounts.\nFederal, state and municipal laws, rules, rules, regulations and ordinances may limit our ability to recover and enforce our rights with respect to the Accounts acquired by us. These laws include, but are not limited to, the following federal statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder and comparable statutes in states where Account debtors reside and/or located:\n(i)\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act;\n(ii)\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act;\n(iii)\nthe Truth-In-Lending Act;\n(iv)\nthe Fair Credit Billing Act;\n(v)\nthe Dodd-Frank Act;\n(vi)\nthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act; and\n(vii)\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act.\nWe may be precluded from collecting Accounts we purchase where the Association or its prior legal counsel, management company, or collection agency failed to comply with applicable laws in charging the account debtor or prosecuting the collection of the Account. Laws relating to the collection of consumer debt also directly apply to our business. Our failure to comply with any laws applicable to us, including state licensing laws, could limit our ability to recover our Accounts and could subject us to fines and penalties, which could reduce our revenues.\nWe may become regulated under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and have not developed compliance standards for such oversight.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010), or Dodd-Frank Act, represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the U.S. The Dodd-Frank Act allows consumers free access to their credit score if their score negatively affects them in a financial transaction or a hiring decision, and also gives consumers access to credit score disclosures as part of an adverse action and risk-based pricing notice. Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, within the Federal Reserve Board, and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. Significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act related to the CFPB became effective on July 21, 2011. The CFPB has broad powers to promulgate, administer and enforce consumer financial regulations, including those applicable to us and possibly our funded Associations. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB is the principal supervisor and enforcer of federal consumer financial protection laws with respect to nondepository institutions, or \u201cnonbanks\u201d, including, without limitation, any \u201ccovered person\u201d who is a \u201clarger participant\u201d in a market for other consumer financial products or services. We do not know if our unique business model makes us a covered person.\nThe CFPB has started to exercise authority to define unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and to require reports and conduct examinations of these entities for purposes of (i) assessing compliance with federal consumer financial protections laws; (ii) obtaining information about the activities and compliance systems or procedures of such entities; and (iii) detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services. The exercise of this supervisory authority must be risk-based, meaning that the CFPB will identify nonbanks for examination based on the risk they pose to consumers, including consideration of the entity\u2019s asset size, transaction volume, risk to consumers, existing oversight by state authorities and any other factors that the CFPB determines to be relevant. When a nonbank is in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws, including the CFPB\u2019s own rules, the CFPB may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce those laws and rules. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders, which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief, and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial protection laws to $25,000 per day for reckless violations and $1 million per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations under Title X, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties). If the CFPB or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws, they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAt this time, we cannot predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting rules and regulations, including those of the CFPB, will impact the U.S. economy and our products and services. Compliance with these new laws and regulations may require changes in the way we conduct our business and could result in additional compliance costs, which could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nCurrent and new laws may adversely affect our ability to collect our Accounts, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nBecause our Accounts are generally originated and collected pursuant to a variety of federal and state laws by a variety of third parties and may involve consumers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, there can be no assurance that all Associations and their management companies, legal counsel, collections agencies and others have at all times been in compliance with all applicable laws relating to the collection of Accounts. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we or our law firms have been or will continue to be at all times in compliance with all applicable laws. Failure to comply with applicable laws could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our Accounts and could subject us to increased costs, fines, and penalties. Furthermore, changes in state law regarding the lien priority status of delinquent Association assessments could materially and adversely affect our business.\nClass action suits and other litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention from operating our business, increase our expenses, and otherwise harm our business.\nCertain originators and servicers involved in consumer credit collection and related businesses have been subject to class actions and other litigation. Claims include failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations such as usury and improper or deceptive origination and collection practices. From time to time we are a party to such litigation, and as a result, our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our everyday business activities and implementing our business strategy, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by, among other things, legal expenses and challenges to our business model in connection with such litigation.\nIf our technology and software systems are not operational or are subject to cybersecurity incidents, our operations could be disrupted and our ability to successfully acquire and collect Accounts could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary software. We must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly track, monitor and collect our Accounts. Any failure of our information systems and their backup systems, including by means of cybersecurity attacks, breaches or other incidents, would interrupt our operations. We may not have adequate backup arrangements for all of our operations and we may incur significant losses if an outage occurs. In addition, we rely on third-party law firms who also may be adversely affected in the event of a cybersecurity breach or attack or other outage in which the third-party servicer does not have adequate backup arrangements. Any interruption in our operations or our third-party law firms\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Accounts\nInsolvency of BLG could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur primary Account servicer, BLG, deposits collections on the Accounts in its Interest on Lawyers Trust Account (\u201cIOLTA Trust Account\u201d) and then distributes the proceeds to itself, us and the Associations pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreements with the Associations and applicable law. We do not have a perfected security interest in the amounts BLG collects on the Accounts while such amounts are held in the IOLTA Trust Account. BLG has agreed to promptly remit to us all amounts collected on the Accounts that are owed to us. If, however, BLG were to become subject to any insolvency law and a creditor or trustee-in-bankruptcy of BLG were to take the position that proceeds of the Accounts held in BLG\u2019s IOLTA Trust Account should be treated as assets of BLG, an Association or another third party, delays in payments from collections on the Accounts held by BLG could occur or reductions in the amounts of payments to be remitted by BLG to us could result, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAssociations do not make any guarantee with respect to the validity, enforceability or collectability of the Accounts acquired by us.\nAssociations do not make any representations, warranties or covenants with respect to the validity, enforceability or collectability of Accounts in their assignments of Accounts to us. If an Account proves to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise generally uncollectible, we will not have any recourse against the respective Association. If a significant number of our Accounts are later held to be invalid, unenforceable or are otherwise uncollectible, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAll of our Accounts are located in Florida, and any adverse conditions affecting Florida could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur primary business relates to revenues from Accounts purchased by us, which are all based in Florida, and our primary source of revenue consists of payments made by condominium and home owners to satisfy the liens against their condominiums and homes. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Florida represented 100% of our Accounts. An economic recession, adverse market conditions in Florida, and/or significant property damage caused by hurricanes, tornadoes or other inclement weather could adversely affect the ability of these condominium and home owners to satisfy the liens against their condominiums and homes, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nForeclosure on an Association\u2019s lien may not result in our company recouping the amount that we invested in the related Account.\nAll of the Accounts purchased by us are in default. The Accounts are secured by liens held by Associations, which we have an option to foreclose upon on behalf of the Associations. Should we foreclose upon such a lien on behalf of an Association, we are generally entitled pursuant to our contractual arrangements with the Association to have the Association quitclaim its interests in the condominium unit or home to us. In the event that any Association quitclaims its interests in a condominium unit or home to us, we will be relying on the short-term rental prospects, to the extent permitted under bylaws and rules applicable to the Association, and value of its interest in the underlying property, which value may be affected by numerous risks, including:\n(i)\nchanges in general or local economic conditions;\n(ii)\nneighborhood values;\n(iii)\ninterest rates;\n(iv)\nreal estate tax rates and other operating expenses;\n(v)\nthe possibility of overbuilding of similar properties and of the inability to obtain or maintain full occupancy of the properties;\n(vi)\ngovernmental rules and fiscal policies;\n(vii)\nacts of God; and\n(viii)\nother factors which are beyond our control.\nIt is possible that as a result of a decrease in the value of the property or any of the other factors referred to in this paragraph, the amount realized from the sale of such property after taking title through a lien foreclosure may be less than our total investment in the Account. If this occurs with regard to a substantial number of Accounts, the amount expected to be realized from the Accounts will decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf Account debtors or their agents make payments on the Accounts to or negotiate reductions in the Accounts with an Association, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time Account debtors and/or their agents may make payments on the Accounts directly to the Association or its management company. Our sole recourse in this instance is to recover these misapplied payments through set-offs of payments later collected for that Association by our third-party law firms. A significant number of misapplied or reduced payments could hinder our cash flows and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccount debtors are subject to a variety of factors that may adversely affect their payment ability.\nCollections on the Accounts have varied and may in the future vary greatly in both timing and amount from the payments actually due on the Accounts due to a variety of economic, social and other factors. Failures by Account debtors to timely pay off their Accounts could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDefaults on the Accounts could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe take assignments of the lien foreclosure rights of Associations against delinquent units owned by Account debtors who are responsible for payment of the Accounts. The payoff of the Accounts is dependent upon the ability and willingness of the condominium and home owners to pay such obligations. If an owner fails to pay off the Account relating to his, her or its unit or home, only net amounts recovered, if any, will be available with respect to that Account. Foreclosures by holders of first mortgages generally result in our receipt of reduced recoveries from Accounts. In addition, foreclosure actions by any holder of a tax lien may result in us receiving no recovery from an Account to the extent excess proceeds from such tax lien foreclosure are insufficient to provide for payment to us. If, at any time, (i) we experience an increase in mortgage foreclosures or tax lien foreclosures or (ii) we experience a decrease in owner payments, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on the skill and diligence of third parties to collect the Accounts.\nBecause the collection of Accounts requires special skill and diligence, any failure of BLG, or any other law firm utilized by us, to diligently collect the Accounts could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe payoff amounts received by us from Accounts may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors beyond our control.\nSeveral factors may reduce the amount that can be collected on any individual Account. The delinquent assessments that are the subject of the Accounts and related charges are included within an Association\u2019s claim of lien under the applicable statute. In Florida, Association liens are recorded in the official county records and hold first priority status with respect to a first mortgage holder for an amount equal to the Super Lien Amount. Associations have assigned to us the right to direct law firms to collect on the liens and foreclose, subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase agreements between each Association and us.\nEach Account presents a separate risk as to the creditworthiness of the debtor obligated to pay the Account, which, in general, is the owner of the unit or home when the Account was incurred and subsequent owners. For instance, if the debtor has incurred a property tax lien, a sale related to such lien could result in our complete loss of the Account. Also, a holder of a first mortgage taking title through a foreclosure proceeding in which the Association is named as a defendant must only pay the Super Lien Amount in a state with a super lien statute. Although we purchase Accounts at a discount to the outstanding balance and the owner remains personally liable for any deficiency, we may decide that it is not cost-effective to pursue such a deficiency. As a result, the purchase or ownership of a significant number of Accounts which result in payment of only the Super Lien Amount or less where no statute specifying a Super Lien Amount applies, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe liens securing the Accounts we own may not be superior to all liens on the related units and homes.\nAlthough the liens of the Associations securing the Accounts may be superior in right of payment to some of the other liens on a condominium unit or home, they may not be superior to all liens on that condominium unit or home. For instance, a lien relating to delinquent property taxes would be superior in right of payment to the liens securing the Accounts. In addition, if an Association fails to assert the priority of its lien in a foreclosure action, the Association may inadvertently waive the priority of its lien. In the event that there is a lien of superior priority on a unit or home relating to one of the Accounts, the Association\u2019s lien might be extinguished in the event that such superior liens are foreclosed. In most instances, the unit or home owner will be liable for the payment of such Account and the ultimate payment would depend on the creditworthiness of such owner. In the case of a tax lien foreclosure, an owner taking title through foreclosure would not be liable for the payment of obligations that existed prior to the foreclosure sale. The purchase or ownership of a significant number of Accounts that are the subject of foreclosure by a superior lien could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not choose to pursue a foreclosure action against condominium and home owners who are delinquent in paying off the Accounts relating to their units or homes.\nAlthough we have the right to pursue a foreclosure action against a unit or home owner who is delinquent in paying off the Account relating to his or her unit or home, we may not choose to do so as the cost of such litigation may be prohibitive, especially when pursuing an individual claim against a single unit or home owner. Our choice not to foreclose on a unit or home may delay our ability to collect on the Account. If we decide not to pursue foreclosure against a significant number of Accounts, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe holding period for our Accounts from purchase to payoff is indeterminate.\nIt can take our third-party law firms anywhere from three months to ten years or longer to collect on an Account. Approximately 61% of our Accounts were purchased prior to 2016, with some being purchased as early as 2008. Due to various factors, including those discussed above, we cannot project the payoff date for any Account. This indeterminate holding period reduces our liquidity and ability to fund our operations. If our ability to collect on a material number of Accounts was significantly delayed, it could adversely affect our cash flows and ability to fund our operations.\nOur business model and related accounting treatment may result in acceleration of expense recognition before the corresponding revenues can be recognized.\nAs we expand our business, we may incur significant upfront costs relating to the acquisition of Accounts. Under United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) such amounts may be required to be recognized in the period that they are expended. However, the corresponding revenue stream relating to the acquisition of such Accounts will not be recognized until future dates. Therefore, we may experience reduced earnings in earlier periods until such time as the revenue stream relating to the acquisition of such Accounts may be recognized.\nRisks Relating to our Securities\nWe may be unable to complete the Hanfor Exchange Transaction.\nWe may be unable to complete the Hanfor Exchange Transaction, as the parties\u2019 respective obligations to complete the transaction are subject to various material closing conditions, including the approval of the Hanfor Exchange Transaction by the Company\u2019s stockholders at a duly called stockholder meeting; the Company\u2019s receipt of audited financial statements for Hanfor for 2018 and 2019; the receipt of a fairness opinion by the Company\u2019s board of directors for the Hanfor Exchange Transaction; the absence of a material adverse change in the business, assets, or operations of Hanfor; the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase at least 729,167 shares of Company common stock (or Hanfor Owner\u2019s purchase of shares in a private placement in lieu thereof); and various customary closing conditions. The conditions to Hanfor Owner\u2019s and Hanfor\u2019s obligation to complete the Hanfor Exchange Transaction will include the continued listing of the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market; the absence of a material adverse change in the business, assets, or operations of the Company; and other customary closing conditions. Any number of factors or circumstances could prevent one or more of the foregoing conditions from being satisfied. Failure to complete the Hanfor Share Exchange, or significant delays in completing the Hanfor Share Exchange, could negatively affect the future business, financial results, and prospects of the Company.\nOur common shares and warrants could be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Company received a notification letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company has not regained compliance with Nasdaq Continued Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires the Company\u2019s listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. Additionally, on January 3, 2020, the Company received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq, indicating that it was in violation of Listing Rules 5620(a) and 5810(c)(2)(G) by virtue of passing the applicable deadline for holding of its annual general meeting of shareholders for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. The March 2020 notification stated that the Company\u2019s securities would be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market on April 7, 2020 unless the Company timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearing Panel. The Company has timely requested a hearing, which has been scheduled for April 30, 2020, and the delisting of the Company\u2019s securities has been stayed pending the Nasdaq Hearing Panel\u2019s decision. There is no assurance that Nasdaq Hearing Panel will accept the Company\u2019s plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules and give the Company additional time to regain compliance.\nBecause the continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market is a condition of Hanfor\u2019s obligation to complete the Hanfor Exchange Transaction, our failure to retain our listing may result in the termination of the Hanfor Exchange Transaction unless Hanfor and the Hanfor Owner waive such condition. In addition, if a suspension or delisting were to occur, there would be significantly less liquidity in the suspended or delisted securities. In addition, our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing would be greatly impaired. Furthermore, with respect to any suspended or delisted common shares, we would expect decreases in investor demand, market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume. Additionally, fewer broker-dealers would be willing to execute trades with respect to such common shares. A suspension or delisting would likely decrease the attractiveness of our common shares to investors and cause the trading volume of our common shares to decline, which could result in a further decline in the market price of our common shares.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our affiliates or other stockholders may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. We had authorized 30,000,000 shares of common stock and preferred stock, respectively as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nWe had 3,134,261 and 3,124,961 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. In addition, pursuant to our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, options to purchase 19,300 and 19,300 respectively, shares of our common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, of which 11,800 and 6,630, respectively were exercisable.\nThere were 3,959,287 and 3,843,587 warrants issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively that allowed for the issuance of 2,879,287 and 2,763,587 shares, respectively. The 1,200,000 warrants that were issued on October 23, 2015 can be exercised for one-tenth share at $12.50. On April 2, 2018 we issued warrants (subsequently adjusted for a reverse stock split and issuance of new common shares) to purchase 143,587 shares of our common stock in conjunction with a $500,000 senior secured indebtedness transaction. On October 31, 2018, the Company issued warrants as part of its secondary offering that allowed for the right to purchase 2,500,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.40 per share. These warrants have average remaining life of 3.8 years as of December 31, 2019. These warrants expire in the year 2023. On May 1, 2019, as a result of an underwriter agreement, we issued warrants to purchase 125,000 shares at an exercise price of $2.64 per share.\nWe may issue additional shares in connection with our business and may grant additional stock options or restricted shares to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our present or future equity compensation plans or we may issue warrants to third parties outside of such plans. If a significant portion of these shares were sold in the public market, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe market price and trading volume of our units, shares of common stock and warrants may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock or warrants (as the case may be) at or above the price you paid for them.\nOur securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for it, in which case, holders of our securities may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, our securities. In addition, when the market price of a company\u2019s equity drops significantly, equity holders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources away from the day-to-day operations of our business.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage of our securities or may issue negative reports, which may adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nWe cannot assure you that securities analysts will cover our company. As of December 31, 2019, no securities analyst covers our company. If securities analysts do not cover our company, this lack of coverage may adversely affect the trading price of our securities. In the event that securities analysts begin to cover our company, the trading market for our securities will rely in part on the research and reports that such securities analysts publish about us and our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our securities, the trading price of our securities may decline. If one or more of these analysts then ceases to cover our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which, in turn, could also cause the trading price of our securities to decline. Further, because of our small market capitalization, it may be difficult for us to attract securities analysts to cover our company, which could significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nIf we do not maintain an effective registration statement, you may not be able to exercise the warrants in a cash exercise.\nFor you to be able to exercise our publicly traded warrants, the resale of the shares of common stock to be issued to you upon exercise of the warrants must be covered by an effective and current registration statement. We have not maintained a current registration statement relating to the resale of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants. As a result, you would be unable to exercise the warrants in a cash exercise and will be required to engage in a cashless exercise in which a number of warrant shares equal to the fair market value of the exercised shares will be withheld. In those circumstances, we may, but are not required to, redeem the warrants by payment in cash. Consequently, there is a possibility that you will never be able to exercise the warrants and receive the underlying shares of common stock. This potential inability to exercise the warrants in a cash exercise, our right to cancel the warrants under certain circumstances, and the possibility that we may redeem the warrants for nominal value, may have an adverse effect on demand for the warrants and the prices that can be obtained from reselling them.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d or \u201cEGC\u201d, as defined under rules of the SEC adopted in connection with the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act, also known as the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d. We will remain an EGC until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public stock offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the first day of the year following the first year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30. For so long as we remain an EGC, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u2022\nbeing permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements;\n\u2022\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation;\n\u2022\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some or all of the available exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this report. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. We cannot predict whether investors will find our warrants or common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our warrants or common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our warrants or common stock and the price of our warrants or common stock may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 15902, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "LMFA"}
