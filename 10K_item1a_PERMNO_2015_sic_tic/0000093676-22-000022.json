{"cik": "93676", "company": "STARRETT L S CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-08-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Company and Financial Position\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing if we fail to compete effectively in the future.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price. Additionally, the Company\u2019s products for the building trades, such as tape measures and levels, are under constant margin pressure due to a channel shift to large national home and hardware retailers. Certain large customers also offer their own private labels \u201cown brand\u201d that compete with Starrett branded products. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies\u2019 products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively or our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost. Lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers\u2019 behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.\nEconomic weakness in the industrial manufacturing sector could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe market for most of the Company\u2019s products is subject to economic conditions affecting the industrial manufacturing sector, including the level of capital spending by industrial companies and the general movement of manufacturing to low cost foreign countries where the Company does not have a substantial market presence. Accordingly, economic weakness in the industrial manufacturing sector may, and in some cases has, resulted in decreased demand for certain of the Company\u2019s products, which adversely affects sales and performance. Economic weakness in the consumer market will also adversely impact the Company\u2019s performance. In the event that demand for any of the Company\u2019s products declines significantly, the Company could be required to recognize certain costs as well as asset impairment charges on long-lived assets related to those products.\nGlobal pandemics have in recent years and could have in the future a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID pandemic negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The pandemic had a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance in past years.\nWe gained experience by monitoring government mandates and recommendations, and we attempted to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities that impacted our business, including following state guidelines for social distancing such as, but not limited to, modifying shift schedules, supporting office-base employees working remotely, educating employees and making accommodations related to personal and workplace hygiene, mandating the wearing of masks, daily monitoring of employee\u2019s temperature and regularly communicating accordingly. However, future dynamics are not predicable although we will continue to be vigilant.\nAdverse global economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results, industry and business.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the conditions in the global economy such as extreme volatility and disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity and market prices, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, supply chain interruptions, uncertainty about economic stability, and global inflation. The demand for our products and services has in the past been significantly affected in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply chain disruptions. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSupply chain disruptions could interrupt product manufacturing and global logistics and increase product costs.\nOur global footprint has had an impact on product offerings and buying behaviors of industry and consumers around the world. In the past few years, the world has seen increased working capital levels required to meet strong customer demand and counteract pandemic related supply chain disruptions which continued to evolve in relation to freight costs, logistics, wage inflation and labor shortages which have impact plant utilization in North America. Along with global supply chain slowing, the Company's Suzhou China operation was impacted by government controls as it related to pandemic related cases and it affected the Company's ability to bring in material and ship finished product to third-party customers and Starrett intercompany partners. China has lifted many of the restrictions.\nIn addition, global inflation has contributed to higher incremental freight costs and such inflation may continue to result in higher freight costs. Failure to adequately produce and timely ship our products to customers could lead to lost potential revenue, failure to meet customer demand, strained relationships with customers, including wholesales, and diminished brand loyalty.\nDespite our actions to mitigate these impacts, we expect to still be impacted by global logistics challenges through calendar year 2022. Specifically, we have invested in bolstering our inventory positions for the first half of 2022 in all regions, which will add to our expenses and impact our profit margins.\nSustained increases in funding obligations under the pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\nThe Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans in both the United States and the United Kingdom for the benefit of its employees. Defined benefit pension plans impose certain funding obligations on the Company. The Company froze the domestic defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2016, and therefore no future benefits will accrue to employees under that plan. Additionally, the Company limited eligibility under the postretirement benefit plan as of December 31, 2013, reducing the liability for the plan. Nevertheless, the Company expects to be required to provide more funding to the domestic pension (and postretirement) plan in the future.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s U.S. funded deficit for the Retirement Plan improved during fiscal year 2022 from $26.6 million at June 30, 2021 to $17.0 million at June 30, 2022 due to an increase in the discount rate offset by asset losses during the year, we are aware that market dynamics can cause material swings in the net funded amount. Further, the Company cannot control these market dynamics.\nIn determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements. Our assumptions for future benefit payments may also change over time, and could be materially higher than originally projected.\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock, or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. We may also explore other strategic alternatives in order to address expected pension liability, including de-risking options or acquisitions or sales of assets or divestitures, in order to meet the Company\u2019s liquidity needs. Divestitures could result in decreased future revenues and profits, and an obligation to make contributions to our pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and growth may be limited.\nPossible failure in the future to obtain necessary capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company's total indebtedness was $30.9 million as compared to indebtedness of $22.0 million as of June 30, 2021. On April 29, 2022, the Company and certain of the Company\u2019s domestic subsidiaries entered into a new Loan and Security agreement with HSBC Bank USA.\nThese new credit facilities replaced the Company\u2019s previous TD Bank credit facilities and are comprised of a $30 million revolving line of credit with a $10 million uncommitted accordion provision, a $12.1 million term loan and a $7 million Capital Expenditure draw down credit facility. The Facilities are secured by a valid first-priority security interest on substantially all existing and future assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries.\nFinancing, including the costs of such financing, may be dependent on numerous factors, including (but not limited to) :\n\u2022general economic and capital market conditions, including the then-prevailing interest rate environment;\n\u2022credit availability from banks and other financial institutions willing to lend;\n\u2022investor confidence in us and our ability to grow the business;\n\u2022our financial performance, especially our cash flow and profitability from operations or lack thereof;\n\u2022our level of any of our indebtedness and our compliance with covenants in debt agreements for such financing;\n\u2022attaining and maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality; and\n\u2022provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining financing for a variety of business and market reasons. Our failure to obtain necessary capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operational results are dependent on how well we can scale our manufacturing capacity and resources to the level of our customers\u2019 demand.\nWe sell our products in industries that require manufacturers to make highly efficient use of manufacturing capacity. Insufficient or excess capacity threatens our ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose us to liabilities such as contractual commitments. Although from time to time we close or consolidate facilities, adapting or modifying our capacity is difficult, as modifications take substantial time to execute, are inherently disruptive and costly and, in some cases, may require regulatory approval. Additionally, delivering products during process or facility modifications requires special coordination. The cost and resources required to adapt our capacity, such as through facility acquisitions, facility closings or process moves between facilities, may negate any planned cost reductions or may result in costly delays, product quality issues or material shortages, all of which could adversely affect our operational results and our reputation with our customers.\nChanges in government monetary or fiscal policies or inflation and increasing interest rates may negatively impact our results.\nMost countries where our products are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which could affect sales of our products. Interest rate changes may also impact our customers\u2019 ability to finance machine purchases and the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.\nCentral banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, create supply chain inefficiencies and could adversely impact our business.\nInflationary pressure may lead to the increasing of interest rates. The Federal Reserve or central banks raising interest rates leads to higher borrowing costs for businesses and a could decrease our profitability. Inflationary cost to manufacturing could also adversely affect our business results.\nIf we do not meet customers\u2019 product quality, reliability standards and expectations, we may experience increased or unexpected product warranty claims and other adverse consequences to our business.\nProduct quality and reliability are significant factors influencing customers' decisions to purchase our products. Inability to maintain the high quality of our products relative to the perceived or actual quality of similar products offered by competitors could result in the loss of market share, loss of revenue, reduced profitability, an increase in warranty costs, government investigations and/or damage to our reputation.\nProduct quality and reliability are determined in part by factors that are not entirely within our control. We depend on our suppliers for parts and components that meet our standards. If our suppliers fail to meet those standards, we may not be able to deliver the quality of products that our customers expect, which may impair our reputation, resulting in lower revenue and higher warranty costs.\nWe provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for 1 year. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Although we maintain warranty reserves in an amount based primarily on the number of units shipped and on historical and anticipated warranty claims, there can be no assurance that future warranty claims will follow historical patterns or that we can accurately anticipate the level of future warranty claims. While the Company has historically not incurred significant warranty expense, an increase\nin the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims, for which we are not insured or where we cannot recover from our vendors to the extent their materials or workmanship were defective, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our manufacturing processes and products do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, or if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, demand for our products may decline and we may be subject to product liability claims.\nOur designs, manufacturing processes and facilities need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. We may also have the responsibility to ensure that products we design satisfy safety and regulatory standards including those applicable to our customers and to obtain any necessary certifications. As a result, products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements or demands of our customers. Potential defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers, replacement costs or reduced or canceled customer orders. If these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. The failure of the products that we manufacture or our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility.\nAny manufacturing or design defects may also result in product liability claims. Furthermore, customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment. We may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used. We also maintain certain insurance policies which may limit our financial exposures. Any significant liabilities which are not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Likewise, a substantial increase in the number of claims that are made against us or the amounts of any judgments or settlements could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVolatility in the price of energy and raw materials, large or rapid increases in the cost of raw materials or components parts, substantial decreases in their availability, or our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials and component parts could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nSteel is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the Company\u2019s products. Historically, market prices of some of our key raw materials have fluctuated on a cyclical basis and have often depended on a variety of factors over which the Company has no control, including as a result of tariffs or other trade barriers. If in the future we are not able to reduce product costs in other areas or pass raw material price increases on to our customers, our margins could be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories, even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers-including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, weather emergencies, global pandemics, such as COVID-19, or other natural disasters- may impair our ability to satisfy our customers and could adversely affect our financial performance. The cost of producing the Company\u2019s products is also sensitive to the price of energy. If we are unable to manage pricing from these suppliers effectively or pass future cost increases through to our customers, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our suppliers terminate these agreements and we are unable to procure alternate products at substantially similar competitive pricing, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to:\n\u2022hire, retain and expand our pool of qualified engineering and technical personnel;\n\u2022maintain technological leadership in our industry;\n\u2022successfully anticipate or respond to changes in manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner; and\n\u2022successfully anticipate or respond to changes in cost to serve in a cost-effective and timely manner\nWe cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or non-competitive. We may have to acquire new technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require us to incur significant expense and capital investment, which could reduce our margins and affect our operating results. When we establish new facilities, we may not be able to maintain or develop our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise due to a lack of trained personnel, effective training of new staff or technical difficulties with machinery. Failure to anticipate and adapt to customers\u2019 changing technological needs and requirements or to hire and retain a sufficient number of engineers and maintain engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory\nInternational operations and our financial results in those markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political, currency exchange and other economic risks.\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, revenue from sales outside of the United States was $120.0 million, representing approximately 47% of consolidated sales. In addition, a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located, or our products are sourced from, outside the United States. As a result, our business is subject to risks associated with international operations. These risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations, unexpected changes in tariffs, taxes or regulatory requirements, changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies, and political unrest and corruption. Regulatory changes could occur in the countries in which we sell, produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries. Restrictions imposed by such changes can have a significant impact on our business.\nIn addition, the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same market. Foreign governmental policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations. Given the unpredictability and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, ongoing or unusual volatility may adversely impact our business and financial conditions.\nCountries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new regulations, or modify existing regulations, including:\n\u2022changes in duties, taxes, tariffs and other charges on imports;\n\u2022limitations on the quantity of goods which may be imported into the United States from a particular country;\n\u2022requirements as to where products and/or inputs are manufactured or sourced;\n\u2022creation of export licensing requirements, imposition of restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum export pricing and/or export prices or duties;\n\u2022currency fluctuations;\n\u2022limitations on foreign owned businesses; or\n\u2022government actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets.\nIn addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations, such as state and local wage and hour laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the False Claims Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), securities laws, import and export laws (including customs regulations) and many others. We may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies, which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry, country or practice. Such investigations or audits may subject us to\nincreased government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.\nFurthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the United States and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, as a result of operating in multiple countries, we must comply with multiple foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations. The FCPA and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, expose us to the risk of such violations. If we fail to comply with laws, rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, we may be subject to government enforcement action, class action litigation or other litigation, damage to our reputation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, and increased cost of regulatory compliance, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nFailure to comply with exchange listing requirements, rules and regulations could negatively affect our Company's listing on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe Company is subject to the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) continued listing requirements. On October 1, 2020, the Company was notified by the NYSE that it was not in compliance with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the Company\u2019s average market capitalization was less than $50 million over a consecutive 30 trading-day period and the stockholders\u2019 equity of the Company was less than $50 million. On March 4, 2021, the NYSE notified the Company that the Company was in compliance in relation to the NYSE's quantitative continued listing standards. This decision came as a result of the Company\u2019s achievement of compliance with the NYSE\u2019s minimum market capitalization and shareholders\u2019 equity requirements during fiscal 2021. Even though the Company regained compliance with minimum market capitalization and shareholders\u2019 equity requirements, there is no guarantee that it will remain in compliance thereafter. The delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade the Company\u2019s common stock and negatively impact the liquidity and price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, the delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. Delisting from the NYSE could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by the Company\u2019s current or prospective third-party providers, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer partnering opportunities.\nOur tax rate is dependent upon a number of factors, a change in any of which could impact our future tax rates and net income.\nOur future tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the enactment of certain tax legislation being considered in the United States and other countries; other changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in the estimated realization of our net deferred tax assets; the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. income and non-U.S. withholding taxes; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities. Losses for which no tax benefits can be recorded could materially impact our tax rate and its volatility from one quarter to another. Any significant change in our jurisdictional earnings mix or in the tax laws in those jurisdictions could impact our future tax rates and net income in those periods.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure with respect to our information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nThe efficient operation of the Company's business is dependent on its information systems, including its ability to operate them effectively and to successfully implement new technologies, systems, controls and adequate disaster recovery systems. In addition, the Company must protect the confidentiality of data of its business, employees, customers and other third parties.\nInformation technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data - are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. On October 7, 2020 our information technology (\"IT\") systems were exposed to a ransomware attack, which partially impaired certain IT systems for a short period of time. We do not believe we experienced any material losses related to the ransomware attack and although we continually attempt to improve upon our security we consider that one attack resolved. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. It is possible that our information technology systems and networks, or those managed by third parties, could have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. The possible failure of the Company's information systems to perform as designed or its failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt the Company's business or subject it to liability and thereby harm its profitability. While the Company continues to enhance the applications contained in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system as well as improvements to other operating systems, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing, or which we cause or have caused third party service providers to implement, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property, including our patents, trade secrets, trademarks and licenses are important in the operation of our business. Although we intend to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in doing so. Third parties may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Litigation, either to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others, could result in substantial costs and in a diversion of our resources. In addition, if a third party would prevail in an infringement claim against us, then we would likely need to obtain a license from the third party on commercial terms, which would likely increase our costs. Our failure to maintain or obtain necessary licenses or an adverse outcome in any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCosts associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various claims and lawsuits that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18438, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "SCX"}
