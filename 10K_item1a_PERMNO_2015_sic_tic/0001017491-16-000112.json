{"cik": "1017491", "company": "APRICUS BIOSCIENCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\nWe expect to continue to require external financing to fund our operations, which may not be available.\nWe expect to require external financing to fund our long-term operations. Such financing may not be available on terms we deem acceptable or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.9 million. Subsequent to year end, we raised $10.0 million from an equity offering. We will receive additional cash from Vitaros\u00ae royalties and product sales. We also have\naccess to additional capital under our committed equity financing facility with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC (\u201cAspire Capital\u201d), subject to certain limitations described below.\nWe have approximately $79.0 million available under the S-3 shelf registration statement (No. 333-198066) and of that, $18.2 million is currently reserved for our committed equity financing facility with Aspire Capital. Our stock price must be $1.00 per share or above in order for us to access the remaining reserve under our committed equity financing facility with Aspire Capital. Assuming a stock price of $1.00 per share or greater, the agreement specifies a maximum number of shares of common stock to be sold, of which approximately 5.0 million shares is currently available. We may sell additional shares under the agreement above the maximum if the total weighted average of all shares issued to date is $1.97 per share or greater. Shares issued to date have a total weighted average sales price of $1.46 per share. As of March 3, 2016, approximately $5.3 million was available under the committed equity financing facility. Based upon our current operating plan and the access to additional capital under our committed equity financing facility as of March 3, 2016, we believe we have sufficient cash to fund our base operations through the third quarter of 2016.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the cost to develop and commercialize our products involves risks and uncertainties, and may be wrong as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section of this report. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nWhile we have historically generated modest revenues from our operations, these revenues will not be sufficient to fund our long-term ongoing operations, including the development and commercialization of our product candidates and general and administrative expenses for the foreseeable future. Given our current lack of profitability and limited capital resources, we may not be able to fully execute all of the elements of our strategic plan, including seeking additional market approvals and commercializing Vitaros\u00ae, and completing our development programs for fispemifene and RayVa\u2122. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives, our business prospects will be diminished and we will likely be unable to achieve profitability.\nWe have a history of operating losses and an accumulated deficit, and we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future.\nWe only began generating revenues from the commercialization of Vitaros\u00ae in the third quarter of 2014, we have never been profitable and we have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately $308.9 million from our inception through December 31, 2015. We have incurred these losses principally from costs incurred in funding the research, development and clinical testing of our product candidates, from our general and administrative expenses and from our efforts to support commercialization of Vitaros\u00ae by our partners. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to generate revenues and become profitable depends, among other things, on (1) the successful development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates including fispemifene and RayVa\u2122, (2) the successful development and commercialization of Vitaros\u00ae in the United States and other markets outside of the United States. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives, we may be unable to achieve profitability and would need to raise additional capital to sustain our operations.\nThere is substantial doubt concerning our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We expect to incur further losses for the foreseeable future. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of this uncertainty and the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of December 31, 2015, the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included immediately prior to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph. Management\u2019s plans include raising additional funds through future financing events, focusing on increasing revenue by seeking new arrangements with commercial distribution partners and the reduction of expenditures. However, no assurance can be given at this time as to whether we will be able to achieve these objectives. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nRevenues based on Vitaros\u00ae represent a substantial portion of our current and expected future revenues.\nOur marketing partners are obligated to pay us royalties on their sales of Vitaros\u00ae. These payments are expected to be a substantial portion of our ongoing revenues for some time. As a result, any setback that may occur with respect to Vitaros\u00ae could significantly impair our operating results and/or reduce the market price of our stock. Setbacks for Vitaros\u00ae could include problems with shipping, distribution, manufacturing, product safety, marketing, government regulation or reimbursement, licenses and approvals, intellectual property rights, competition with existing or new products and physician or patient acceptance of the product, as well as higher than expected total rebates, returns or discounts.\nIn markets where Vitaros\u00ae is approved, we are substantially dependent on marketing partners to successfully commercialize Vitaros\u00ae.\nIn markets where Vitaros\u00ae has received regulatory approval, we do not have or expect to have any sales or marketing infrastructure. Accordingly, our operating results and long-term success is substantially dependent on the commercialization efforts of our worldwide marketing partners. In jurisdictions where we have commercialized our products with partners the amount of revenue we receive from product sales will be lower than if we commercialized directly, as we will be required to share the revenues with our partners. If our partners\u2019 commercialization efforts for Vitaros\u00ae are unsuccessful, we may realize little or no revenue from sales in such markets.\nIn addition, distribution of Vitaros\u00ae requires cold-chain distribution, whereby the product must be maintained between specified temperatures. If a difficulty arises in our partner\u2019s cold-chain distribution processes, through our partner\u2019s failure to maintain Vitaros\u00ae between specified temperatures, Vitaros\u00ae could be damaged or spoiled and rendered unusable. Our marketing partners may also be required to repackage Vitaros\u00ae in certain smaller territories where Vitaros\u00ae has been approved, or our marketing partners may make claims about applications of Vitaros\u00ae beyond uses approved by regulators. Any failure by our partners to comply with packaging, labeling, advertising or promoting requirements in any jurisdiction may result in restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of Vitaros\u00ae, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls, which could negatively affect our potential future revenues. Our marketing partners independently determine when to order new product and whether to release Vitaros\u00ae in compliance with their own policies and guidelines. Our partners\u2019 internal product release guidelines, over which we have no control, may be more restrictive than local regulations. This may result in delays of sales, delivery or new orders of our product. For example, Sandoz reported that it was out of stock of Vitaros\u00ae in Germany in July 2015 and in Sweden and Belgium in January 2016 because it has put a hold on releasing additional batches pending the results of an ongoing out-of-specification investigation by our contract manufacturer. We cannot give any assurance that Sandoz will resume product orders in Germany, Sweden or Belgium soon, or at all.\nAny failure of our partners to adequately perform their obligations under our license agreements for Vitaros\u00ae or any of our other product candidates or the termination of such agreements could have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nWe and our licensees depend upon third party manufacturers for our products Vitaros\u00ae, fispemifene, and RayVa\u2122 and for the raw materials, components, chemical supplies, and dispensers required for our finished products.\nWe do not manufacture any of our products or product candidates. As such, we are dependent on third party manufacturers for the supply of these products and product candidates. The manufacturing process for our products is highly regulated and regulators may refuse to qualify new suppliers and/or terminate manufacturing at existing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Further, our commercial partners may require changes in the product specifications which could cause delays or additional costs to be incurred. The inability of our contract manufacturers to successfully produce commercial quantities of Vitaros\u00ae with an acceptable shelf-life could delay or prevent a commercial launch in certain territories, which would negatively affect our potential future revenues.\nOur third-party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to numerous regulations, including Good Manufacturing Practices, FDA regulations governing manufacturing processes and related activities and similar foreign regulations. Our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are independent entities who are subject to their own operational and financial risks that are out of our control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers or suppliers fail to perform as required or fail to comply with the regulations of the FDA and other applicable governmental authorities, our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis, receive royalties or continue our clinical trials would be adversely affected. Also, the manufacturing processes of our manufacturing partners may be found to violate the proprietary rights of others, which could interfere with their ability to manufacture products on a timely and cost effective basis.\nIn addition, we and our licensees are also dependent on third party manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials, components, chemical supplies for the active drugs in our products and product candidates under development for the formulation and supply of our NexACT\u00ae enhancers and finished products. We are dependent on these third-party manufacturers for dispensers that are essential in the production of our products Vitaros\u00ae and other products and product candidates. These raw materials, components, chemical supplies, finished products and dispensers must be supplied on a timely basis and at satisfactory quality levels.\nIf our third party product manufacturers or suppliers of raw materials, components, chemical supplies, finished products and dispensers fail to produce quality products on time and in sufficient quantities, or if we are unable to secure adequate alternative sources of supply for such materials, components, chemicals, finished products and dispensers, our results would suffer, as we or our licensees would encounter costs and delays in re-validating new third party suppliers.\nOur financial prospects depend in part on the ability of our contract manufacturers and our suppliers to produce and deliver Vitaros\u00ae in Canada, Europe and other countries within the approved product specifications. If Vitaros\u00ae is not able to be manufactured and provided to customers within the desired specifications and if those specifications cannot be maintained in accordance with approved label requirements, the expected sales by our partners may not be possible and our financial results would be negatively impacted.\nWe are dependent upon our suppliers and manufacturers of active drug substance, proprietary excipient and other components used in Vitaros\u00ae to produce and deliver these materials for Vitaros\u00ae manufacturing according to the approved quality specifications filed with the regulatory authorities and according to GMP. If these suppliers or manufacturers are not able to supply these materials in a consistent and timely manner, or fail to meet the regulatory requirements to include Vitaros\u00ae product specifications, then Vitaros\u00ae would not be able to be manufactured.\nSimilarly, we are dependent upon contract manufacturers to produce Vitaros\u00ae dosage form according to the approved specifications for each territory. If the manufacturers are not able to make Vitaros\u00ae for any reason, such as an unexpected plant shutdown, failure of certain inspections by regulatory authorities, equipment failure or inability to meet approved regulatory specifications for Vitaros\u00ae, then Vitaros\u00ae would not be able to be delivered to our partners.\nIt is possible that our contract manufacturers will not be able to successfully manufacture according to the requirements, and any unforeseen delay, inability to manufacture, or any unforeseen circumstance whereby the approved product label cannot be maintained could significantly impact our financial results. Sandoz reported that it was out-of-stock of Vitaros\u00ae in Germany in July 2015 and in Sweden and Belgium in January 2016. Sandoz has put a hold on releasing additional batches pending the results of an ongoing out-of-specification investigation by our contract manufacturer. Such investigation relates to a stability sample of Vitaros\u00ae manufactured for sale in the United Kingdom. All relevant health authorities have been informed and are privy to the ongoing investigation. Our other Vitaros\u00ae partners continue to release batches and sell product in the U.K., France, Spain and Italy. There can be no assurances that we will not experience similar manufacturing issues in the future.\nThe product specifications for Vitaros\u00ae, and other pharmaceutical products, are governed by the applicable jurisdiction\u2019s regulatory authorities and those specifications may affect the ability of our partners to manufacture a product with a desired product shelf-life, prescribing information or other product characteristics that impact their marketing goals. Such product specifications are specific to each individual jurisdiction\u2019s market-approval directives and are generally not applicable to those product specifications approved by other countries\u2019 regulatory authorities.\nThe manufacturing specifications for producing Vitaros\u00ae in Canada affect the expected shelf-life that can be achieved for the product. Mylan, Inc., our marketing partner in Canada, is working with their contract manufacturer to optimize the shelf-life period for the cold-chain product prior to launch. If any of our partners are unable to achieve the desired product shelf life within approved specifications, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nPre-clinical and clinical trials are inherently unpredictable. If we or our partners do not successfully conduct the clinical trials or gain regulatory approval, we or our partners may be unable to market our product candidates.\nThrough pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, our product candidates, such as fispemifene and RayVa\u2122, must be demonstrated to be safe and effective for their indicated uses. Results from pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be indicative of, or allow for, prediction of results in later-stage testing. Many of the pre-clinical studies that we have conducted are in animals with \u201cmodels\u201d of human disease states. Although these tests are widely used as screening mechanisms for drug candidates before being advanced to human clinical studies, results in animal studies are less reliable predictors of safety and efficacy than results of human clinical studies. Future clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates or may not result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates. Commercial sales in any territory cannot begin until approval is received from the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the United States.\nOur business is dependent in part on the success of our product candidates, which will require significant additional clinical testing before we can seek regulatory approval and potentially commercialize products.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product candidates will require additional clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote our product candidates in the United States before we receive regulatory approval from the United States FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in overseas jurisdictions, and we may not receive such regulatory approvals on a timely basis, or at all.\nOur clinical development plan for RayVa\u2122 includes a Phase 2b take-home clinical trial and up to two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon secondary to scleroderma. We reported results on the Phase 2a clinical trial in September 2015, which supported moving RayVa\u2122 forward into future clinical trials expected to begin in 2016. Our clinical development plan for fispemifene includes Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in patients with secondary hypogonadism. We initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial for fispemifene in May 2015 and we expect to report top-line data from that trial in the first quarter of 2016. There is no\nguarantee that we will commence our planned clinical trials or that our ongoing clinical trials will be completed on time or at all, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials. Even if such regulatory authorities agree with the design and implementation of our clinical trials, we cannot guarantee that such regulatory authorities will not change their requirements in the future. In addition, even if the clinical trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of the clinical trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of our product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nWe cannot anticipate when or if we will seek regulatory review of our product candidates for any indication. We in-licensed the rights to Vitaros\u00ae in the United States in September 2015. We expect to resubmit an NDA in the second half of 2016. An NDA must include extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the drug candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness for each desired indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process and may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. We have not received marketing approval for any product candidates in the United States, and we cannot be certain that our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval for any indication. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis or at all, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, on our ability to commercialize our product candidates and on the favorableness of the labeling language granted as well as the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for the treatment of Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon secondary to scleroderma or secondary hypogonadism, chronic prostatitis and LUTS in men are not as significant as we estimate, our business and prospects will be harmed.\nIf we are unable to adequately establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights, we may incur substantial litigation costs and may be unable to generate significant product revenue.\nProtection of the intellectual property for our products and product candidates is of material importance to our business in the United States and other countries. We have sought and will continue to seek proprietary protection for our product candidates to attempt to prevent others from commercializing equivalent products. Our success may depend on our ability to (1) obtain effective patent protection within the United States and internationally for our proprietary technologies and products, (2) defend patents we own, (3) preserve our trade secrets and (4) operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify certain of our partners for certain liabilities with respect to the defense, protection and/or validity of our patents and would also be required to incur costs or forgo revenue if it is necessary for our partners to acquire third party patent licenses in order for them to exercise the licenses acquired from us.\nWhile we have obtained patents and have many patent applications pending, the extent of effective patent protection in the United States and other countries is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy addresses the breadth of claims allowed in, or the degree of protection afforded under, patents of medical and pharmaceutical companies. Patents we currently own or may obtain might not be sufficiently broad enough to protect us against competitors with similar technology. Any of our patents could be invalidated or circumvented.\nFurthermore, holders of competing patents could allege that our activities infringe on their rights and could potentially prevail in litigation against us. We have also sold certain patents in transactions where we have licensed rights to our drug candidates. In certain of these transactions, we have agreed to indemnify the purchaser from third party patent claims, which could expose us to potentially significant damages for patents that we no longer own. Any litigation could result in substantial cost to us and would divert management\u2019s attention, which may harm our business. In addition, our efforts to protect or defend our proprietary rights may not be successful or, even if successful, may result in substantial cost to us.\nWe face a high degree of competition.\nWe are engaged in a highly competitive industry. We and our licensees compete against many companies and research institutions that research, develop and market products in areas similar to those in which we operate. For example, Viagra\u00ae(Pfizer), Cialis\u00ae(Lilly), Levitra\u00ae(Glaxo Smith Kline), Stendra\u00ae(Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), and Spedra\u00ae(Menarini Group) are currently approved for treatment of ED. Various companies have testosterone replacement therapies on the market for hypogonadism, such as Androgel (Abbott Labs), Axiron (Eli Lilly) and Testim, Testopel, Striant, Aveed and Fortesta (Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.).\nThese and other competitors may have specific expertise and development technologies that are better than ours. Many of these competitors, which include large pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development capabilities and substantially greater experience than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may successfully develop competing products. We are also competing with other companies and their products with respect to manufacturing efficiencies and marketing capabilities, areas where we have limited or no direct experience.\nOur pharmaceutical expenditures may not result in commercially successful products.\nWe cannot be sure our business expenditures will result in the successful acquisition, development or launch of products that will prove to be commercially successful or will improve the long-term profitability of our business. If such business expenditures do not result in successful acquisition, development or launch of commercially successful brand products, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nBusiness development activity involves numerous risks, including the risks that we may be unable to integrate an acquired business successfully and that we may assume liabilities that could adversely affect us.\nIn order to augment our product pipeline or otherwise strengthen our business, we may decide to acquire or license additional businesses, products and technologies. Acquisitions could require us to raise significant capital and involve many risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving identified financial revenue synergies, growth opportunities, operating synergies and cost savings;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the personnel, operations and products of an acquired company, and the potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in consolidating information technology platforms, business applications and corporate infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating our corporate culture with local customs and cultures;\n\u2022\npossible overlap between our products or customers and those of an acquired entity that may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses;\n\u2022\nour inability to achieve expected revenues and gross margins for any products we may acquire;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nrisks and challenges of entering or operating in markets in which we have limited or no prior experience, including the unanticipated effects of export controls, exchange rate fluctuations, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, and foreign political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in reorganizing, winding-down or liquidating operations if not successful.\nIn addition, foreign acquisitions involve numerous risks, including those related to changes in local laws and market conditions and due to the absence of policies and procedures sufficient to assure compliance by a foreign entity with United States regulatory and legal requirements. Business development activities require significant transaction costs, including substantial fees for investment bankers, attorneys, and accountants. Any acquisition could result in our assumption of material unknown and/or unexpected liabilities. We also cannot provide assurance that we will achieve any cost savings or synergies relating to recent or future acquisitions. Additionally, in any acquisition agreement, the negotiated representations, warranties and agreements of the selling parties may not entirely protect us, and liabilities resulting from any breaches could exceed negotiated indemnity limitations. These factors could impair our growth and ability to compete, divert resources from other potentially more profitable areas, or otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe financial statements of acquired companies, or those that may be acquired in the future, are prepared by management of such companies and are not independently verified by our management. In addition, any pro forma financial statements prepared by us to give effect to such acquisitions may not accurately reflect the results of operations of such companies that would have been achieved had the acquisition of such entities been completed at the beginning of the applicable periods.\nWe may be subject to product liability and similar claims, which may lead to a significant financial loss if our insurance coverage is inadequate.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human therapeutic products. Product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is extremely expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Although we maintain various types of insurance, we have no guarantee that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate. If liability claims were made against us, it is possible that our insurance carriers may deny, or attempt to deny, coverage in certain instances. A successful claim against us if we are uninsured, or which is in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, could have a material adverse effect upon us and on our financial condition.\nOur business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or security breach of our information technology infrastructure.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure, including internet-based systems, and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. We are constantly updating our information technology infrastructure. Any failure to manage, expand and update our information technology infrastructure or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure could harm our business.\nDespite our implementation of security measures, our systems and those of our business partners may be vulnerable to damages from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, telecommunication and electrical failures, and other similar disruptions. Our business is also potentially vulnerable to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by third parties as well as employees. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations, could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, could lead to the public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial participants and others, and could result in a material disruption to our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could harm our business and cause us to incur liability. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully operate our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with healthcare providers, clinicians and scientists. We are highly dependent upon our senior management and scientific staff. We have incurred attrition at the senior management level in the past, and although we have employment agreements with five of our executives, these agreements are generally terminable at will at any time, and, therefore, we may not be able to retain their services as expected. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management and scientific staff could delay or prevent us from successfully operating our business. Competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense, particularly in the San Diego, California area, where our offices are located. We may need to hire additional personnel to support development and commercial efforts for Vitaros\u00ae and to support our further development of fispemifene and RayVa\u2122. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nOur ability to maintain, expand or renew existing business relationships and to establish new business relationships, particularly in the drug development sector, also depends on our ability to subcontract and retain scientific staff with the skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in drug development technologies.\nFrom time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings, which could expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe, as well as certain of our officers and distributors, are subject, from time to time, to a number of legal proceedings. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and any claims and disputes may result in significant legal fees and expenses regardless of merit and could divert management\u2019s time and other resources. If we are unable to successfully defend or settle any claims asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices or product lines. Any of these outcomes could cause our business, financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted. There is no guarantee of a successful result in any of these lawsuits regardless of merit, either in defending these claims or in pursuing counterclaims.\nWe are exposed to potential risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we report annually on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Among other things, we must perform systems and processes evaluation testing. This includes an assessment of our internal controls to allow management to report on, and our independent public accounting firm to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In connection with our compliance efforts, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur or expend, substantial accounting and other expenses and significant management time and resources. Further, in connection with our management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, we determined that, as of December 31, 2014, material weaknesses existed in our internal control over financial reporting over the accounting for and disclosures of technical accounting matters in the consolidated financial statements and effective monitoring and oversight over the controls in the financial reporting process. While our management has concluded that we have remediated these material weaknesses as of December 31, 2015, there can be no assurances that our future assessments, or the future assessments by our independent registered public accounting firm, will not reveal further material weaknesses in our internal controls. If material weaknesses are identified in the future we would be required to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective, which would likely require additional financial and management resources and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe terms of our Credit Facility place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nOn October 17, 2014, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with Oxford Finance LLC (\u201cOxford\u201d) and Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d) (Oxford and SVB are referred to together as the \u201cLenders\u201d) that is secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property. The principal balance under the Credit Facility was $9.5 million as of December 31, 2015.\nThe Credit Facility includes affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and any subsidiaries we create in the future. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals,\ndeliver certain financial reports and maintain insurance coverage. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on our transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets, and suffering a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Credit Facility also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which provide Oxford, as collateral agent, with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the term loans under the Credit Facility, including foreclosure against our properties securing the Credit Facility, including our cash. These events of default include, among other things, our failure to pay any amounts when due under the Credit Facility, a breach of covenants under the Credit Facility, our insolvency, a material adverse change, the occurrence of any default under certain other indebtedness in an amount greater than $250,000, and a final judgment against us in an amount greater than $250,000.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to license agreements with both Allergan and Forendo Pharma Ltd. that impose diligence, development and commercialization timelines, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. Under our existing licensing agreements, we are obligated to pay royalties on net product sales of Vitaros\u00ae or fispemifene to the extent they are covered by the agreements. If we fail to comply with our obligations, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture or market any product that is covered by these agreements and may face other penalties under the agreements. Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the value of product candidates being developed using rights licensed to us under any such agreement. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.\nWe may enter into license agreements in the future that could also impose diligence, development and commercialization timelines, milestone payments, royalty, insurance and other obligations.\nFluctuations in the value of the Euro or other foreign currency could negatively impact our results of operations and increase our costs.\nCertain revenues from our commercialization partners are denominated in the Euro or another foreign currency although our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk, and our results of operations may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the other foreign currency. A significant appreciation in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar, for instance, will result in higher expenses and cause increases in our net losses. Likewise, to the extent that we generate any revenues denominated in foreign currencies, or become required to make payments in other foreign currencies, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and those foreign currencies could also negatively impact our results of operations. We currently have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts to reduce the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and foreign currency hedging is inherently risky and may result in unanticipated losses.\nIndustry Risks\nInstability and volatility in the financial markets in the global economy are likely to have a negative impact on our ability to raise necessary funds.\nDuring the past several years, there has been substantial volatility in financial markets due in part to the global economic environment. In addition, there has been substantial uncertainty in the capital markets and access to financing is uncertain. These conditions are likely to have an adverse effect on our industry, licensing partners and business, including our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe expect to need to raise capital through equity sales and/or incur indebtedness, if available, to finance operations. However, continued volatility in the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through sales of capital stock or through borrowings, in the public or private markets on terms that we believe to be reasonable, if at all.\nChanges in trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including difficult market conditions, could adversely affect our operating results.\nIndustry trends and economic and political factors that affect pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies also affect our business. In the past, mergers, product withdrawals, liability lawsuits and other factors in the pharmaceutical industry have slowed decision-making by pharmaceutical companies and delayed drug development projects. Continuation or increases in these trends could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries generally, and more specifically drug discovery and development, are subject to increasingly rapid technological changes. Our competitors might develop technologies, services or products that are\nmore effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies, services or products, or that render our technologies, services or products less competitive or obsolete. If competitors introduce superior technologies, services or products and we cannot make enhancements to our technologies, services or products to remain competitive, our competitive position, and in turn our business, revenue and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe and our licensees are subject to numerous and complex government regulations which could result in delay and expense.\nGovernmental authorities in the United States and other countries heavily regulate the testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution, advertising and marketing of our proposed product candidates. None of our proprietary products under development have been approved for marketing in the United States. Before any products we develop are marketed, FDA and comparable foreign agency approval must be obtained through an extensive clinical study and approval process.\nThe failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals for our product candidates under development in a timely manner, or at all, would delay or preclude us and our licensees from marketing our product candidates or limit the commercial use of our product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we intend that our product candidates will also be sold and marketed outside the United States, we and/or our licensees will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursements. These requirements vary widely from country to country. The failure to meet each foreign country\u2019s requirements could delay the introduction of our proposed product candidates in the respective foreign country and limit our revenues from sales of our proposed product candidates in foreign markets.\nWe face uncertainty related to healthcare reform, pricing and reimbursement, which could reduce our revenue.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell Vitaros\u00ae or any products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nFor example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act, was enacted to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential drug candidates are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries under their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\na new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nAlthough it is too early to determine the full effect of the Affordable Care Act, the law has continued the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and increased the industry\u2019s regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went\ninto effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly following the 2016 presidential election cycle, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products and product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nIf reimbursement for our products is substantially less than we expect in the future, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased, our business could be materially and adversely impacted. Further, numerous foreign governments are also undertaking efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation, regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and pharmaceutical companies.\nSales of Vitaros\u00ae and other product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors such as United States and foreign government insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other health care related organizations. Both the federal and state governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation affecting coverage and reimbursement policies, which are designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care. Further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely that could limit the prices that can be charged for the product candidates that we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity. There may be future changes that result in reductions in current coverage and reimbursement levels for our products and we cannot predict the scope of any future changes or the impact that those changes would have on our operations.\nAdoption by the medical community of Vitaros\u00ae and other product candidates, if approved, may be limited if third-party payors will not offer coverage. Cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for drugs, which in turn would negatively affect the price that we will be able to charge. We are unable to predict all changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private or government payors to any drug candidate we have in development. Any denial of private or government payor coverage or inadequate reimbursement for our products could harm our business and reduce our revenue.\nThe FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy and time-consuming, and if we experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval of our product candidates, our business may be substantially harmed.\nWe may experience delays in commencing and completing clinical trials of our product candidates. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Any of our planned clinical trials may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022\nthe availability of financial resources for us to commence and complete our planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms and pricing with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining independent institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence clinical trials in each country;\n\u2022\nrecruiting a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nhaving patients complete a clinical trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites; or\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of our product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages or potential side effects of the drug candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for such indications.\nWe could encounter delays if physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of our product candidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs in the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, the Data Monitoring Committee for such trial (if included), or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety\nissues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Furthermore, we rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we have agreements governing the CROs\u2019 services, we have limited influence over their actual performance. If we experience termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues from our product candidates. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nIf we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our business will be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, we will be unable to sell our product candidates, which will impair our ability to generate additional revenues. To receive approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with substantial evidence from clinical trials that the product candidate is both safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought. Failure can occur in any stage of development. Satisfaction of the approval requirements is unpredictable but typically takes several years following the commencement of clinical trials, and the time and money needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. We cannot predict if or when our existing and planned clinical trials will generate the data necessary to support an NDA and if, or when, we might receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidates are safe and effective for any of the proposed indications;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates\u2019 clinical and other benefits outweigh their safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to support the submission of an NDA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval; and\n\u2022\neven after following regulatory guidance or advice, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may still reject our ultimate regulatory submissions since their guidance is generally considered non-binding and the regulatory authorities have the authority to revise or adopt new and different guidance at any time.\nThis lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any approvals that we obtain may not cover all of the clinical indications for which we are seeking approval, or could contain significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings, precautions or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use. In such event, our ability to generate revenues would be greatly reduced and our business would be harmed.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also require additional risk management activities and labeling which may limit distribution or patient/prescriber uptake. An example would be the requirement of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy in order to approve our product candidates, which could entail requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and record-keeping for our product candidates will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, and registration. We are also required to maintain continued compliance with cGMP requirements and cGCPs requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates or other manufacturers\u2019 products in the same class, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our product candidates, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of license approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur relationships with investigators, health care professionals, consultants, third-party payors, and customers are subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws, which could expose us to penalties.\nOur business operations and arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, marketing partners, third-party payors and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our products and product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to such physician owners (manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year); and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of undesirable side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants, commercial partners and vendors are subject to a number of regulations and standards.\nWe are exposed to the risk that employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultant and vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity for which we may be held responsible. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (1) the laws of the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies; including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies, (2) manufacturing standards, (3) healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the\nUnited States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws, or (4) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. If we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our potential exposure under such laws will increase significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. These third parties may not perform as contractually required or expected and issues may arise that could delay the completion of clinical trials and impact regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nWe sometimes rely on third parties, such as CROs, medical institutions, academic institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are responsible for confirming that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency require us to comply with good laboratory practices for conducting and recording the results of our preclinical studies and cGCP, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data gathered and reported results are accurate and that the clinical trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities. If the third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, do not meet expected deadlines, fail to comply with cGCP, do not adhere to our clinical trial protocols or otherwise fail to generate reliable clinical data, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be more costly than expected or budgeted, extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nOur CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical studies may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nFurther, if our contract manufacturers are not in compliance with regulatory requirements at any stage, including post-marketing approval, we may be fined, forced to remove a product from the market and/or experience other adverse consequences, including delays, which could materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nWe are vulnerable to volatile stock market conditions.\nThe market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, have been highly volatile. The market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In addition, future announcements, such as the results of testing and clinical trials, the status of our relationships with third-party collaborators, technological innovations or new therapeutic products, governmental regulation, developments in patent or other proprietary rights, litigation or public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others and general market conditions concerning us, our competitors or other biopharmaceutical companies, may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have been more likely to initiate securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nAlthough our stockholders may in the future receive dividends if and when declared by our board of directors, we do not intend to declare dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is currently restricted\nby the terms of our Credit Facility. Therefore, you should not purchase our common stock if you need immediate or future income by way of dividends from your investment.\nWe may issue additional shares of our capital stock that could dilute the value of your shares of common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 160,000,000 shares of our capital stock, consisting of 150,000,000 shares of our common stock and 10,000,000 shares of our preferred stock. We have approximately $79.0 million available under the S-3 shelf registration statement (No. 333-198066) and of that, $18.2 million is currently reserved for our committed equity financing facility with Aspire Capital.\nIn light of our future capital needs, we may also issue additional shares of common stock at or below current market prices or issue convertible securities. These issuances would dilute the book value of existing stockholders common stock and could depress the value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88177, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SEEL"}
