Many of these risk factors are also identified in connection with the more specific descriptions of our business and results of operations contained throughout this report. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic conditions may increase many of these risks.\nCustomers and Revenue Growth Risks\nWe seek to generate new business revenues to support our ongoing operations.\nOur businesses generally require a higher level of new business revenues than we currently have in order to operate profitably. We are working to increase our revenues with new and existing customers. However, if we are not successful in significantly increasing over overall net revenues, we may be unable to maintain the critical mass of capital investments or talented employees that are needed to succeed in our chosen markets or to maintain our existing facilities, which could result in additional restructuring or exit costs. As we expand our customers and our products, we must also effectively manage a more diverse production schedule to avoid slowing our production output. As we are awarded new products with new customers, we must onboard new operational processes in an effective and efficient manner. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in increasing our revenues with new and existing customers to a level necessary to maintain or return to profitability.\nEven when we are chosen by a new or existing customer for new business, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete final contract negotiations on acceptable terms or at all. In many cases, we announce significant contract \u201corders\u201d, \u201cwins\u201d or \u201cawards\u201d before final contract negotiations are complete, and there is a chance that these new announced contract orders, wins or awards may not result in a definitive agreement or the expected amount of revenues or profits. We cannot guarantee that any particular contract with a customer will result in the anticipated level revenue or profitability.\nWe depend on a few key customers in challenging industries for most of our revenues.\nOur five largest customers in 2020 were Northrop Grumman, Sistemas, Detroit Diesel, ADI and SubCom, which in the aggregate accounted for 64% of net revenue. The loss of any of these customers or any other significant customer, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Due to our customer concentration, if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants or change their purchasing patterns, our business may be harmed.\nThe truck components and assemblies industry has experienced consolidation, credit risk, highly cyclical market demand, labor unrest, rising steel costs, extensive raw material lead-times, bankruptcy and other obstacles. The demand for our energy-related products lines, historically, has risen and fallen with the prices of oil and/or natural gas, as our customers\u2019 capital expenditures budgets tend to be dependent upon energy prices. We depend on the continued growth and financial stability of customers in these industries and our core markets, as well as general economic conditions. Adverse changes affecting these customers, markets or economic conditions could harm our operating results.\nThe aerospace and defense electronics industry has experienced consolidation, increased competition, disruptive new technologies and uncertain funding levels. The aerospace and defense industry is also pressured by cyclicality, rapid technological change, shortening product life cycles, decreasing margins, component obsolescence and shortages and government procurement and certification processes. Our aerospace and defense business faces reduced revenues in the final phases of several key legacy programs which must be replenished with new technologies if we are to successfully maintain or expand our market share. Our failure to address any of these factors could impair our ability to grow and diversify our base of customers in this segment.\nThere can be no assurance that any of our customers will not default on, delay or dispute payment of, or seek to reject our outstanding invoices in bankruptcy or otherwise. In addition, the existence of these factors may result in fewer customers in our target markets due to consolidation, bankruptcy, competitive or other market reasons, making it more difficult to obtain new clients and diversify our customer base in the near future.\nCustomer contracts could be less profitable than expected.\nWe generally bear the risk that our contracts could be unprofitable or less profitable than planned, despite our estimates of revenues and future costs to complete such contracts.\nA material portion of our business, historically, has been conducted under multi-year contracts, which generally include fixed prices or periodic price reductions without minimum purchase requirements. Over time, our revenues may not cover any increases in our operating costs which could adversely impact our results. Our financial results are at greater risk when we accept contractual responsibility for raw material or component prices, when we cannot offset price reductions, freight penalties, importation fees and cost increases with operating efficiencies or other savings, when we must submit contract bid prices before all key design elements are finalized or when we are subjected to other competitive pressures which erode our margins. The profitability of our contracts also can be adversely affected by unexpected start-up costs on new programs, inability to negotiate milestone billings, operating inefficiencies, scheduling constraints, ineffective capital investments, inflationary pressures or inaccurate forecasts of future unit costs.\nUnexpected changes in our customers\u2019 demand levels and our ability to execute our production efficiently have harmed our operating results in the past and could do so in the future. Many of our customers will not commit to firm production or delivery schedules. Inaccurate forecasting of our customers\u2019 requirements can disrupt the efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, inventories or workforce and can cause increases in our inventory and working capital levels. If we receive unanticipated orders or rapid increases in demand, these incremental volumes could be unprofitable due to the higher costs of operating above our optimal capacity. Disagreements over pricing, quality, delivery, capacity, exclusivity or trade credit terms could disrupt order schedules. Orders may also fluctuate due to changing global capacity and demand, new products, changes in market share, reorganizations or bankruptcies, material shortages, labor disputes, freight costs, tariffs or other factors that discourage outsourcing. These forces could increase, decrease, accelerate, delay or cancel our delivery schedules.\nOur ability to stabilize employee retention and execute on existing customer orders could put current revenues at risk as we proceed with the execution of our plans. If we lose anticipated revenues, we might not succeed in redeploying our substantial capital investments and other fixed costs, potentially forcing additional plant closures, impairments of long-lived and other assets or increased losses.\nCongressional budgetary constraints or reallocations could reduce our government related sales.\nSypris Electronics serves as a contractor for large aerospace and defense companies such as Northrop Grumman and L3Harris, typically under federally funded programs, which represented approximately 37% and 23% of net revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSypris Electronics was adversely affected by declines in the overall government defense market due to the effects of sequestration in the past, and may be further affected if funding for programs in which we participate, either by selling products directly to U.S. government agencies or as a subcontractor to prime contractors such as Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, SubCom, LLC (SubCom) and ADI, is reduced, delayed or cancelled. Our ability to obtain new contract awards also could be negatively affected by funding and budgeting for such programs.\nCompetition Risks\nIncreasing competition could limit or reduce our market share.\nAs an outsourced manufacturer, we operate in highly competitive environments that often include our customers\u2019 internal capabilities. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the availability of manufacturing capacity, increasingly unfavorable currency exchange rates (especially in low-cost countries), technological strength, speed and flexibility in responding to design or schedule changes, price, quality, delivery, cost management and financial strength. Our earnings could decline if our competitors or customers can provide comparable speed and quality at a lower cost, or if we fail to adequately invest in the range and quality of products and manufacturing capabilities our customers require.\nMost of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and organizational resources, geographic breadth and range of products, customer bases and brand recognition than we do. As a result, our competitors may respond more quickly to technological changes or customer needs, consume lower fixed and variable unit costs, negotiate reduced component prices, and obtain better terms for financing growth. If we fail to compete in any of these areas, we may lose market share and our business could be seriously harmed. There can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition or that we will be able to achieve profitability as these new challenges arise.\nOur technologies could become obsolete, reducing our revenues and profitability.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by changing technology and continuing process development. The future of our business will depend in large part upon the continuing relevance of our technological capabilities. We could fail to make required capital investments, develop or successfully market products that meet changing customer needs and anticipate or respond to technological changes in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our inability to successfully launch or sustain new or next generation programs or product features, especially in accordance with budgets or committed delivery schedules, could materially adversely affect our financial results. We could encounter competition from new or developing technologies that render our technologies and equipment less profitable or obsolete in our chosen markets and our operating results may suffer. In particular, the Company is currently developing new products and pursuing new programs in an attempt to increase Sypris Electronics\u2019 revenue stream. However, commercializing the new products and programs is costly and has been slower than anticipated. The launch of any new products or programs within Sypris Electronics may not be successful.\nExecution Risks\nContract terminations or delays could harm our business.\nWe often provide products under contracts that contain detailed specifications, quality standards and other terms. If we are unable to perform in accordance with such terms, our customers might seek to terminate such contracts, demand price concessions or other financial consideration or downgrade our performance ratings or eligibility for new business. Moreover, many of our contracts are subject to termination for convenience or upon default. These provisions could provide only limited recoveries of certain incurred costs or profits on completed work and could impose liability for our customers\u2019 costs in procuring undelivered items from another source. If any of our significant contracts were to be repudiated, terminated or not renewed, we could lose substantial revenues, and our operating results as well as prospects for future business opportunities could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various audits, reviews and investigations, including private party \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits, relating to our compliance with federal and state laws. Should our business be charged with wrongdoing, or determined not to be a \u201cpresently responsible contractor,\u201d we could be temporarily suspended or debarred from receiving new government contracts or government-approved subcontracts.\nWe must operate more efficiently.\nIf we are unable to improve the cost, efficiency and yield of our operations, and if we are not able to control costs, our financial results could suffer and we could be forced to sell additional assets, take on additional debt at higher costs or take other measures to restructure our operations or capital structure. A number of major obstacles could include:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties arising from our present financial condition, including difficulties in maintaining customer and supplier relationships and difficulties acquiring new business due to lingering concerns about our financial condition until we have returned to consistent profitability;\n\u25cf\nefforts to increase our manufacturing capacity, maintain quality control systems and launch new programs, especially as we continue to increase production at our Mexico operations;\n\u25cf\nthe breakdown or the need for major repairs of critical machinery or equipment, especially as we increase production at our Mexico operations;\n\u25cf\nthe risk of warranty expenses and product liability claims, including the outcome of known or potential recall campaigns, if our products fail to meet or perform to specifications or cause property damage, injury or death;\n\u25cf\ninflationary pressures;\n\u25cf\ntariffs or trade restrictions imposed on imports or exports, particularly in the United States and Mexico;\n\u25cf\nour ability to comply with exportation and importation regulations with an expanding global market;\n\u25cf\nincreased borrowing due to declines in sales;\n\u25cf\nchanges in anticipated product mix and the associated variances in our profit margins;\n\u25cf\nthe need to identify and eliminate our root causes of scrap;\n\u25cf\nour ability to achieve expected annual savings or other synergies from past and future business combinations;\n\u25cf\ninventory risks due to forecasting errors, shifts in market demand, the unanticipated loss of future business, or the obsolescence and/or price erosion of raw materials or component parts on hand; and\n\u25cf\nany inability to successfully manage growth, contraction or competitive pressures in our primary markets.\nOur management or systems could be inadequate to support our existing or future operations, especially as we downsize our operating staff to reduce expenses while we work to increase revenues. New customers or new contracts, particularly with new product offerings, could require us to invest in additional equipment or other capital expenditures which exceed our budgeted plans. We may have limited experience or expertise in installing or operating such equipment, which could negatively impact our ability to deliver products on time or with acceptable costs. In addition, a material portion of our manufacturing equipment requires significant maintenance to operate effectively, and we may experience maintenance and repair issues. The risk of technical failures, nonconformance with customer specifications, an inability to deliver next generation products or other quality concerns could materially impair our operating results. Similarly, expanding production for our energy-related products without effective process or quality controls could materially increase scrap rates and may impact the safety of our operating environment or expose our business to warranty risks and contractual violations.\nCyber security risks could negatively affect operations and result in increased costs.\nSypris Electronics, as a U.S. defense contractor, and our Company overall, face cyber security threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees and terrorist or criminal acts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures and natural disasters.\nWe routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and often are not recognized until launched against a target, or even some time after. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis even if our security measures are appropriate, reasonable, and/or comply with applicable legal requirements. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are also a significant concern for all companies, including ours.\nAlthough we work cooperatively with our customers and our suppliers, subcontractors, and other partners to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities, and those safeguards might not be effective.\nThe costs related to cyber security or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the products we provide to customers, loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts, early obsolescence of our products, our future financial results, our reputation or our stock price.\nSupplier Risks\nInterruptions in the supply of key components and quality systems could disrupt production.\nSome of our products require one or more components that are available from a limited number of providers or from sole-source providers. In the past, some of the materials we use, including steel, certain forgings or castings, capacitors and memory and logic devices, have been subject to industry-wide shortages or capacity allocations. As a result, suppliers have been forced to allocate available quantities among their customers, and we have not been able to obtain all of the materials desired. Some of our suppliers have struggled to implement reliable quality control systems which can negatively impact our operating efficiency and financial results. In downward business cycles, the tightening of credit markets has threatened the financial viability of an increasing number of suppliers of key components and raw materials and forced unanticipated shutdowns. Our inability to reliably obtain these or any other materials when and as needed has in the past and could in the future slow production or assembly, delay shipments to our customers, cause noncompliance with product certifications, impair the recovery of our fixed costs and increase the costs of recovering to customers\u2019 schedules, including overtime, expedited freight, equipment maintenance, operating inefficiencies, higher working capital and the obsolescence risks associated with larger buffer inventories. Each of these factors could adversely affect operating results.\nShortages or increased costs of utilities could harm our business and our customers.\nWe and our customers depend on a constant supply of electricity and natural gas from utility providers for the operation of our respective businesses and facilities. In the past, we have experienced power outages which reduced our ability to deliver products and meet our customers\u2019 demand for those products. If we or our customers experience future interruptions in service from these providers, our production and/or delivery of products could be negatively affected. We have experienced increased costs due to the heavy consumption of energy in our production process, which have been offset through revised production schedules. However, if the cost of energy continues to increase, our results of operations and those of certain customers could be negatively impacted.\nFluctuations in the price of raw materials, including tariffs or other trade restrictions on imported steel or other goods, could negatively impact us.\nFor significant portions of our business, we purchase raw materials and component parts which have been designated or specified by our customers, at prices negotiated by our customers. Raw material price fluctuations and volatility in the commodity markets, including tariffs and trade restriction could impact prices in the future. While our customers have generally agreed to reimburse us for the cost of such materials, this could change in the future, and our risks will continue to include the timely communication and successful collection of any such reimbursements. In any event, for a growing part of our business, we arrange our own suppliers and we could be impacted by the risks of any landed price increases, trade restrictions or production delays. Increases in the costs of steel or other supplies could also increase our working capital requirements, scrap expenses and borrowing costs.\nIn general, there can be no assurance that any price fluctuations relating to tariffs or trade restrictions will not reduce demand, slow production, delay shipments to our customers or increase our costs in the future, any of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nAccess to Capital and Acquisitions Risks\nUntil we have returned to sustained levels of profitability, our access to capital may be limited.\nUntil the Company becomes profitable again, there can be no assurances that the Company will succeed in attracting new, acceptable sources of debt or equity capital. If we are unable to become profitable on a timely basis, we may need to use existing cash resources or other assets to fund operating losses. While we have borrowed from Gill Family Capital Management, Inc. (\u201cGFCM\u201d), an entity controlled by the Gill family which beneficially owns approximately 15.3% of our common stock, on acceptable terms in the past, there can be no assurances that such debt financing would be available in the future.\nWe have incurred indebtedness under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) which may be subject to audit, may not be forgivable and may eventually have to be repaid. Any repayment of such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us and may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Company entered into a promissory note with BMO Harris Bank National Association (\u201cBMO\u201d), effective May 1, 2020, that provides for a loan in the amount of $3.6 million (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) pursuant to expansion of the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) 7(a) loan program (the \u201cPaycheck Protection Program\u201d or \u201cPPP\u201d), established under the CARES Act. The PPP Loan is subject to forgiveness under the PPP upon submission and review of a loan forgiveness application, to the extent that PPP Loan proceeds have been used to pay expenses permitted by the PPP, including payroll costs, covered rent and mortgage obligations, and covered utility payments. Amounts outstanding under the loan bear a fixed interest rate of 1.0% per annum with a maturity date of May 1, 2022, two years from the commencement date.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury and SBA have announced that SBA will conduct audits for PPP loans that exceed $2 million. Should we be audited or reviewed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the SBA as a result of the PPP Loan or filing an application for forgiveness or otherwise, such audit or review could result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, generate negative publicity and cause us to incur legal and reputational costs. If we were to be audited and receive an adverse outcome in such an audit, we could be required to return the full amount of the PPP Loan and may potentially be subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties. We may not have the resources to repay the PPP Loan if required to do so by the federal government.\nOn November 24, 2020, the Company submitted an application for forgiveness of the entire amount due on the PPP Loan. There can be no assurance that the principal and interest amounts under the PPP Loan will be forgiven. If all or substantially all of the PPP Loan is not forgiven or it is subsequently determined that it must be repaid, we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations or proceeds from the sale of our assets to pay interest and principal on the PPP Loan. Any such repayment of the PPP Loan will reduce the funds available to us for working capital and other corporate purposes and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or divert funds that are otherwise necessary to run our business. We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely repayments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. Additionally, though we believe we are eligible recipients of the PPP Loan under the PPP and our use of PPP Loan proceeds has been in compliance with PPP rules and guidance, our receipt of the PPP Loan and the use of PPP Loan proceeds could result in negative publicity, or expose us to claims or potential liability under the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government, if it is determined that we were in fact not eligible to take the PPP Loan in the first instance.\nOur ability to finance expansion or new business opportunities may be limited.\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements depend on numerous factors other than bank borrowings or debt financing, including the pace at which we can effectively cut costs, increase revenues or successfully launch new products. One method we have historically used to increase our revenues and obtain multi-year supply agreements is to buy a customer\u2019s non-core manufacturing assets, or to acquire alternative, but equivalent, production capabilities and to produce products for such customers under a multi-year contract. We have also pursued strategies that rely on research and development efforts to develop and commercialize our new products. We may not have the financial resources or be able to raise funds necessary to pursue these strategies under any future debt agreements which could further limit our ability to replace the loss of revenues.\nOur growth strategies could be ineffective due to the risks associated with further acquisitions.\nOur growth strategy has included acquiring complementary businesses. We could fail to identify, obtain financing or complete suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and prices. Acquisition efforts entail a number of risks, including: diversion of management\u2019s attention; difficulties in integrating systems, operations and cultures; potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies; lack of experience operating in the geographic market of the acquired business; an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements; risks of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience; difficulties in integrating purchased technologies and products with our technologies and products; our ability to improve productivity and implement cost reductions; our ability to secure collective bargaining agreements with employees; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities.\nOur discovery of, or failure to discover, material issues during due diligence investigations of acquisition targets, either before closing with regard to potential risks of the acquired operations, or after closing with regard to the timely discovery of breaches of representations or warranties, or of certain indemnified environmental conditions, could seriously harm our business.\nWe could fail to fully implement our growth plans.\nAs the Company seeks to expand its revenues and strategically diversify its customer base, we could fail to adequately overcome significant obstacles such as slowing markets, the loss of key employees, unexpected increases in costs, or new competitors or technologies in our key markets, among other risks. The failure to fully implement our growth plans could materially adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition.\nLabor Relations Risks\nWe must attract and retain qualified employees while successfully managing related costs.\nOur future success in a changing business environment, including during rapid changes in the size, complexity or skills required of our workforce, as we experienced in 2018 and 2017 and again in 2021, will depend to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive, managerial and technical employees. The loss of key employees, especially in a strong economic environment, and our ability to effectively train existing employees, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our future success will also require an ability to attract and retain qualified employees, especially those with engineering or production expertise in our core business lines.\nChanges in our labor costs such as salaries, wages and benefits, or the cost of providing pension and other employee benefits, changes in health care costs, investment returns on plan assets and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities or other requirements to accelerate the level of our pension fund contributions to reduce or eliminate underfunded liabilities, could lead to increased costs or disruptions of operations in any of our business units.\nDisputes with labor unions could disrupt our business plans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 386 employees (all of which were in Sypris Technologies), or 58% of our total employees. Excluding certain Mexico employees covered under an annually ratified agreement, there are no collective bargaining agreements expiring within the next 12 months. Certain Mexico employees are covered by an annually ratified collective bargaining agreement. These employees in Mexico represented approximately 53% of the Company\u2019s workforce, or 350 employees at December 31, 2020. Our ability to maintain our workforce depends on our ability to attract and retain new and existing customers as well as maintain good relations with our employees and labor unions. We could experience a work stoppage or other disputes which could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and could harm our operating results.\nRegulatory Risks\nEnvironmental, natural disasters, health and safety risks could expose us to potential liability.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals and substances used in our operations. If we fail to comply with present or future regulations, we could be forced to alter, suspend or discontinue our manufacturing processes and pay substantial fines or penalties.\nGroundwater and other contamination has occurred at certain of our current and former facilities during the operation of those facilities by their former owners, and this contamination may occur at future facilities we operate or acquire. There is no assurance that environmental indemnification agreements we have secured from the former owners of certain of these properties will be adequate to protect us from liability. Additionally, certain property we sold which was designated as Brownfields has been approved for development by the current owners and could expose us to future costs.\nOur business is also subject to potential liabilities with respect to health and safety matters. We are required to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the health and safety of our workforce, and we could be held liable for damages arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other dangerous working conditions. Health and safety laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. As a result, our future costs to comply with such laws or the liabilities incurred in the event of any violations may increase significantly.\nA natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on our operations, those plans may be insufficient, and any catastrophe may disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel disruption, trade disruption and has effected many companies\u2019 operations globally. Infections may continue to be widespread, including in the countries where we have operations, and travel restrictions may remain or worsen, all of which could lead to reduced demand for our products and services, disruptions in our supply chain, any of which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. Under our self-insured employee health program, the costs associated with a large number of employees infected could significantly impact our results.\nChanges in interest rates and asset returns could increase our pension funding obligations and reduce our profitability.\nWe have unfunded obligations under certain of our defined benefit pension plans. The valuation of our future payment obligations under the plans and the related plan assets are subject to significant adverse changes if the credit and capital markets cause interest rates and projected rates of return to decline. Such declines could also require us to make significant additional contributions to our pension plans in the future. A material increase in the unfunded obligations of these plans could also result in a significant increase in our pension expense in the future.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nOur provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our plans to repatriate the earnings of our non-U.S. operations to the U.S. and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. introduced broad ranging tax reform with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cAct\u201d) legislation. Among the tax reforms was a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Although the tax reform in the U.S. reduced the statutory tax rate to 21% for 2018, the effects of the lower rate were offset in part by the effects of increased nondeductible expenses and the global intangible low taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) provisions which result in a certain amount of foreign earnings being subjected to U.S. tax. Considering the exclusion of foreign subsidiary dividends from taxation in the U.S., we believe the Act will provide some greater flexibility to repatriate future earnings of our foreign operations.\nOur income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of our tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy our income tax obligations.\nAdverse regulatory developments or litigation could harm our business.\nOur businesses operate in heavily regulated environments. We must successfully manage the risk of changes in or adverse actions under applicable law or in our regulatory authorizations, licenses and permits, governmental security clearances or other legal rights to operate our businesses, to manage our work force or to import and export goods and services as needed. Our business activities expose us to the risks of litigation with respect to our customers, suppliers, creditors, stockholders or from warranty claims or product liability, environmental or asbestos-related matters. We also face the risk of other adverse regulatory actions, compliance costs or governmental sanctions, as well as the costs and risks related to our ongoing efforts to design and implement effective internal controls.\nGeneral Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19, which has spread to every state in the United State and every county and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization underscores certain risks we face, including those described above. COVID-19 has resulted in authorities imposing, and businesses and individuals implementing, numerous unprecedented measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors, suppliers, and partners. We have manufacturing operations in the U.S. and Mexico, and each of these countries has been materially affected by the outbreak and taken measures to try to contain it. While we believe that, based on the various standards published to date, the work our employees are performing for the aerospace and defense, energy and transportation markets is essential, there can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not impose restrictions on the operations of our facilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or that our facilities will continue to operate during the pandemic. If our operations or the operations of our suppliers are restricted, we may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These cost increases may result in unfavorable changes in estimates which may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. The ultimate impact and efficacy of government measures and potential future measures is currently unknown.\nThere is considerable uncertainty regarding the business impacts from such measures and potential future measures. Shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including work-from-home and social distancing policies implemented to protect employees, have resulted in reduced workforce availability at some of our sites, and reduced capacity at some of our vendors and suppliers. Restrictions on our access to or operation of our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers, can impact our ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if prolonged. Similarly, current, and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures or delays, and increased border controls, delays or closures, can also impact our ability to meet demand and could materially adversely affect us. Our customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations and supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, or collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The current outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19 has caused an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. There is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of any such slowdown or recession. We have seen and may continue to see negative impacts on demand in some of our markets, particularly automotive and oil and gas. Given the significant economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on our business but it has and may continue to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and social distancing measures), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, vendors, and suppliers. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, which could have an adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions.\nRecently, the market price for our common stock has been volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control and may be unrelated to our financial condition, operating performance, prospects or other indicators of value. The factors include:\n\u25cf\nthe impact on global and regional economies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity or changes in our forecasts and guidance;\n\u25cf\nchanges in recommendations by the investment community or their estimates of our net revenues or operating results;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors or new market entrants, including new contracts or renewals of existing contracts, strategic actions, management changes, and material transactions or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\ntechnical factors in the public trading market for our stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as it may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock, fractional share trading and other technical trading factors or strategies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements regarding stock repurchases, sales of our common stock, credit agreements and debt issuances;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us, our customers or competitors;\n\u25cf\nsales of stock by us, our officers or directors; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic market conditions.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\nWe carry a range of insurance policies intended to protect our assets and operations, including general liability insurance and property damage insurance. While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages, and as a result our insurance program may not fully cover us for losses we may incur. In addition, as a result of a number of catastrophic weather and other events in the United States, insurance companies have incurred substantial losses and accordingly in many cases they have substantially reduced the nature and amount of insurance coverage available to the market, have broadened exclusions, and/or have substantially increased the cost of such coverage. It is likely that the tight insurance market will continue into the foreseeable future. Our business requires that we maintain various types of insurance. If such insurance is not available or not available on economically acceptable terms, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face other factors which could seriously disrupt our operations.\nMany other risk factors beyond our control could seriously disrupt our operations, including: risks relating to war, future terrorist activities, or political uncertainties; risks relating to another pandemic, natural disasters or other casualties which could shut down our domestic or foreign facilities, disrupt transportation of products or supplies, increase the costs under our self-insurance program or change the timing and availability of funding in our aerospace and defense electronics markets; risks inherent in operating abroad, including foreign currency exchange rates, adverse regulatory developments, and miscommunications or errors due to inaccurate foreign language translations or currency exchange rates; or our failure to anticipate or to adequately insure against other risks and uncertainties present in our businesses including unknown or unidentified risks.", "PERMNO": 80534, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "SYPR"}
