RISK FACTORS\nWe provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to the Extensive Regulation of Our Business\nFailure of our schools to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for school operations could result in financial requirements or penalties, restrictions on our operations and loss of external financial aid funding.\nAs detailed in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment,\u201d our institutions are subject to extensive regulatory requirements imposed by a wide range of federal and state agencies, as well as by our institutional accreditor. These requirements, which are frequently being revisited, revised, and expanded, cover virtually every aspect of our schools\u2019 operations. The approvals granted by these entities permit our schools to operate and to participate in a variety of government-sponsored financial aid programs, including Title IV Programs, from which we derived approximately 66% of our revenues, on a cash basis, in fiscal year 2020. If our institutions fail to comply with any of these regulatory requirements, our regulators could take an array of adverse actions, including, without limitation, revocation of the approval granted by the agency. Any such adverse action could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, and impose significant operating restrictions upon us. We cannot predict with certainty how all of these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future.\nFailure to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot predict how Title IV Program requirements described in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment-Title IV Programs\u201d will change in the future or be interpreted. Additionally, given the complex nature of the regulations and the fact that they are subject to interpretation, it is reasonable to conclude that in the conduct of our business, we may inadvertently violate such regulations. In the event of a violation, ED could impose sanctions or limitations, or terminate an institution\u2019s Title IV Program eligibility. Types of sanctions or limitations ED might impose include, without limitation: requiring the repayment of Title IV Program funds; imposing a less favorable payment system for the institution\u2019s receipt of Title IV Program funds; placing an institution on provisional certification status; commencing a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV Programs; or declining to renew the institution\u2019s program participation agreement. Such sanctions or limitations, or the loss of Title IV Program eligibility by any of our current or future institutions, could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nForms of noncompliance that could result in sanctions or limitations, or cause the institution to lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs, include, without limitation: a failure to maintain the state authorizations described in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment-State Authorization\u201d; a failure to maintain the institutional accreditation described in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment-Accreditation\u201d; a failure to satisfy the administrative capability standards discussed in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment-Administrative Capability\u201d; a failure to satisfy the loan default rate thresholds discussed in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment-Three Year Student Loan Default Rates\u201d; a failure to satisfy the loan default rate thresholds discussed in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment-Perkins Loan Default Rates\u201d; a failure to correctly calculate and timely return unearned Title IV Program funds received for students who withdraw before completing their educational programs; a failure to correctly determine whether students are making satisfactory academic progress in their programs and, as such, remain eligible to receive Title IV Program funds; or a failure to satisfy the financial responsibility standards detailed in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment-Financial Responsibility.\u201d Similarly, the following types of noncompliance could result in sanctions or limitations, or cause the institution to lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs:\n\u202290/10 Rule. A failure by one of our institutions to derive at least 10% of its revenues for each fiscal year from sources other than Title IV Program funds, as described in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment-The 90/10 Rule.\u201d We also observe that multiple legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress that would impact the 90/10\nRule, such as reducing the 90% maximum under the rule to 85% or including military and veterans\u2019 funding in the 90% portion of the calculation. Such statutory revisions could negatively impact our institutions\u2019 ability to satisfy the 90/10 Rule.\n\u2022Substantial Misrepresentations. A determination by ED that one or more of our institutions engaged in a substantial misrepresentation, as described in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Substantial Misrepresentations.\u201d If ED determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may impose sanctions or other conditions upon the institution including, but not limited to, initiating an action to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs. Either ED or the person to whom the alleged misrepresentation was made also could seek to have the person\u2019s loans discharged under the borrower defense to repayment regulations discussed below.\n\u2022Incentive Compensation. A determination by ED that one or more of our institutions failed to comply with the \u201cincentive compensation\u201d prohibition, as described in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Incentive Compensation.\u201d Because the current regulations differ significantly from prior regulations, and because of the imprecise nature of many aspects of these regulations and ED\u2019s published guidance, it is not clear how ED will apply these regulations in all circumstances. For this reason, we cannot guarantee that ED will not take a position that some aspect of our compensation practices is not in compliance with these regulations.\nFor more information, see \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Title IV Programs.\u201d\nCompliance with current and future Title IV Program regulations arising out of negotiated rulemakings could materially and adversely affect our business.\nED is almost continuously engaged in one or more negotiated rulemakings, which is the process pursuant to which it revisits, revises, and expands the complex and voluminous Title IV Program regulations. These regulations also are frequently challenged through litigation, creating significant uncertainty as to when and what part of the regulations have taken effect, how they should be implemented, and how they will be interpreted and enforced. We devote significant effort to understanding the effects of these regulations on our business and to developing compliant solutions that also are congruent with our business, culture, and mission to serve our students and industry relationships. However, we cannot predict with certainty how these new and developing regulatory requirements will be applied or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future. Significant negotiated rulemakings that could materially and adversely affect our business are discussed in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Title IV Program Rulemaking.\u201d\nThe 2019 BDTR Rule, which took effect July 1, 2020, requires institutions to report certain events to ED. One such reportable event is the closure of our Norwood, Massachusetts campus in July 2020. In May 2019, we submitted our formal notification to ED regarding the closure of the Norwood, Massachusetts campus. ED has acknowledged receipt of our notification and has not requested any further information at this time. We cannot predict the timing, content or impact of any future requests from ED, if any, related to the closure of our Norwood, Massachusetts campus. The occurrence, and notification to ED, of such actions, events, or conditions could result in ED recalculating our composite score or requiring us to submit a letter of credit in an amount to be calculated by ED and agree to other conditions on our Title IV participation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss of funds from Veterans' benefits programs could materially and adversely affect our business.\nA discussed in \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Other Federal and State Student Aid Programs,\u201d to participate in veterans\u2019 benefits programs, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill, the REAP, and VA Vocational Rehabilitation, our institutions must comply with certain requirements applicable to these programs. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could lose our eligibility to participate in veterans\u2019 benefits programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. Specific considerations that could negatively impact the funding we receive from veterans\u2019 benefits programs include, without limitation: (1) restricted access to military installations for student recruitment; (2) the success of federal legislative proposals that would increase the requirements of the 90/10 Rule, such as reducing the 90% maximum under the rule to 85% and/or including military and veteran funding in the 90% portion of the calculation; (3) a reduction in appropriations for veterans\u2019 benefits programs, or an extended government shutdown; and (4) an inability to secure approvals in one or more states, delays in the process for obtaining approvals, or the revocation of an approval.\nCongress may change the law or reduce funding for or place restrictions on the use of funds received through Title IV Programs, which could reduce our student population, revenues and/or profit margin.\nCongress periodically revises the HEA and other laws, and enacts new laws, governing Title IV Programs and determining the funding level for each Title IV Program, and may make changes in the laws at any time. Congress most recently reauthorized the HEA in 2008. It is actively working on another HEA reauthorization, but it is uncertain whether and when the process will be completed. Any action by Congress that significantly reduces funding for Title IV Programs or the ability of our schools or students to receive funding through these programs or places restrictions on the use of funds received by an institution through these programs could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. Such action may occur during HEA reauthorization, or such action could also occur as part of separate technical amendments to the HEA or during Congress\u2019 annual budget and appropriations cycle. These uncertainties could reduce our student population, revenues and/or profit margin.\nContinued or increased examination of the for-profit education sector could result in further legislation, appropriations, regulations, and enforcement actions that could materially or adversely affect our business.\nOver the last decade, Congress has focused significantly on for-profit education institutions, specifically regarding participation in Title IV Programs and DOD oversight of tuition assistance for military service members attending for-profit colleges. Continued or increased Congressional activity could result in the enactment of more stringent legislation, further rulemakings affecting participation in Title IV Programs and other governmental actions, increasing regulation of the for-profit sector. The likelihood of such activity could be increased as a result of elections and appointments. The composition of federal and state executive offices, executive agencies, and legislatures are subject to change based on the results of periodic elections, appointments, and other events. In some cases, candidates for elected positions in federal or state executive or legislative offices or for appointments to positions in federal or state agencies have negative opinions on for-profit education providers or may support initiatives such as eliminating or reducing student aid eligibility for for-profit education providers or providing funding to free or reduced tuition programs at public and other nonprofit postsecondary education institutions, which could adversely impact our ability to compete with such institutions. Action by Congress or other regulators may increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our institutions to comply with Title IV Program requirements. In addition, concerns generated by this Congressional activity may adversely affect enrollment in for-profit educational institutions such as ours. Any laws that are adopted that limit our or our students\u2019 participation in Title IV Programs or in programs to provide funds for active duty service members and veterans or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible, or any decreases in enrollment related to the Congressional activity concerning this sector, could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed if we experience a disruption in our ability to process student loans under the Federal Direct Loan Program.\nBecause all Title IV Program student loans (other than Perkins loans) are now processed under the DL program, any processing disruptions by ED may impact our students\u2019 ability to obtain student loans on a timely basis. A disruption in our ability to process student loans through the DL program, either because of administrative challenges on our part or the inability of ED to process the increased volume of loans through the DL program on a timely basis, could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties alleging noncompliance with applicable standards. Each of our institutions\u2019 administration of Title IV Program funds must be audited annually by independent accountants and the resulting audit report must be submitted to ED for review. Compliance reviews and claims could also result from our notification to an agency or third party based upon our own internal compliance review. We are also subject to various lawsuits, investigations and claims, covering a wide range of matters, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of federal and state laws, false claims made to the federal government and routine employment matters. While we are committed to strict compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and accrediting standards, if the results of government, regulatory or third party reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to successfully defend against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of regulatory approvals or Title IV Program funding or other\nfederal and state funding, injunctions or other penalties. We could also incur substantial legal costs that are not covered or are in excess of our insurance coverage. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or defend those lawsuits or claims. Additionally, given the significant public scrutiny being placed on the sector we operate in, numerous state attorneys general have initiated investigations either of the operation of the for-profit schools in their state or of particular institutions operating in that state. Changes occurring at the federal or state level, as well as our financial performance in recent years, may spur further action or additional reporting requirements by state attorneys general, congressional leadership or state licensing bodies.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of unsettled matters, and we may incur significant defense costs and other expenses in connection with them in excess of our insurance coverage related to these matters. We may be required to pay substantial damages, settlement costs or fines or penalties. Such costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our licenses, accreditation and eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nFor more information, see \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to the Extensive Regulation of Our Business - Failure to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs could materially and adversely affect our business\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Environment - Title IV Programs.\u201d\nOur business and stock price could be adversely affected as a result of regulatory investigations of, or actions commenced against, us or other companies in our industry.\nThe operations of companies in the education and training services industry, including us, are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny. In some cases, allegations of wrongdoing on the part of such companies have resulted in formal or informal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, state governmental agencies, ED and other federal agencies. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of legislative hearings and regulatory actions at both the federal and state levels, focusing not only on the individual schools but in some cases on the for-profit postsecondary education sector as a whole. These investigations of, or regulatory actions against, specific companies in the education and training services industry could have a negative impact on our industry as a whole and on our stock price. Furthermore, the outcome of such investigations and any accompanying adverse publicity could negatively affect student enrollment and heighten the risk of class action lawsuits against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in the state regulatory environment, state and agency budget constraints and increased regulatory requirements, may affect our ability to obtain and maintain necessary authorizations or approvals from those states to conduct or change our operations.\nDue to state budget constraints and changes in the regulatory environment in some of the states in which we operate, it is possible that some states may reduce the number of employees in, or curtail the operations of, the state education agencies that authorize our schools. A delay or refusal by any state education agency in approving any changes in our operations that require state approval, such as the opening of a new campus, the introduction of new programs or the revision of existing programs, a change of control or the hiring or placement of new admissions representatives, could prevent us from making such changes or delay our ability to make such changes, or could require substantial additional costs to accommodate such delay.\nState education agencies that authorize our schools continue to revise or issue new regulations requiring significant additional reporting and monitoring of student outcomes. Additionally, state education agencies may request additional information or supplemental reporting as a result of our recent financial performance. The regulations and reporting requirements may lengthen the time to obtain necessary state approvals and require us to modify our operations in order to comply with the requirements. This could impose substantial additional costs on our institutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nState legislatures also continue to contemplate creating new performance metrics that would have to be satisfied to maintain eligibility. The enactment of one or more of these proposed laws or similar laws could create compliance challenges and impose substantial additional costs on our institutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nBudget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could reduce the amount of such financial aid that is available to our students, which could reduce our student population and negatively affect our 90/10 Rule calculation and other compliance metrics.\nSome states are facing budget constraints that are causing them to reduce state appropriations in a number of areas including financial aid provided to students that may attend one of our programs. These states may decide to reduce or redirect the amount of state financial aid that they provide to students, but we cannot predict how significant any of these reductions will be or how long they will last. If the level of state funding available to our students decreases and our students are not able to secure alternative sources of funding, it could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition, negatively impact our cohort default rates, or impact our performance under the federal 90/10 Rule calculation, as this state funding is counted in the non-Title IV Program funds portion of the ratio.\nIf we acquire an institution that participates in Title IV Programs or open an additional location, one or more of our regulators could decline to approve the acquired institution or additional location, or could impose material conditions or restrictions, which could prevent or limit the ability of the acquired institution and/or additional location to participate in Title IV Programs and, in turn, impair our ability to operate the acquired institution and/or the additional location as planned or to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of that institution and/or opening of the additional location.\nIf we acquire an institution that participates in Title IV Program funding or open an additional location, we must obtain approval from ED and applicable state education agencies and accrediting commissions in order for the institution or additional location to be able to operate and participate in Title IV Programs. Such approvals may be withheld or delayed. An acquisition can result in the temporary suspension of the acquired institution\u2019s participation in Title IV Programs and opening an additional location can result in a delay of the campus\u2019 participation in Title IV Programs unless we submit a timely and materially complete application for approval of the acquisition or the opening of the new location. If we were unable to timely establish or re-establish the state authorization, accreditation or ED certification of the acquired institution or obtain approval for the new location, our ability to operate the acquired institution or open the additional location as planned or to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of that institution or the opening of the additional location could be significantly impaired.\nFurther, ED and applicable state education agencies and accrediting agencies could impose material conditions or restrictions on us and the acquired institution or the additional location, including, but not limited to, a material letter of credit, limitations or prohibitions on the ability to add new campuses or add or change educational programs, placement of the institution on the heightened cash monitoring or reimbursement method of payment and reporting and notification requirements. Additionally, an acquired institution may have known or unknown instances of noncompliance with federal, state or accrediting agency requirements, including, but not limited to, noncompliance with requirements included in the defense to repayment regulations that could result in liabilities, sanctions, or material conditions or restrictions that we may inherit by acquiring the institution. Further, our due diligence efforts relating to institutions that we intend to acquire may be unsuccessful and fail to identify noncompliance or other facts that could result in liabilities, sanctions, or material conditions or restrictions. The imposition of liabilities, sanctions, or material conditions or restrictions by one or more regulators could impair our ability to operate the acquired institution or open the additional location as planned or to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of that institution or the opening of the additional location.\nIf regulators do not approve additional or revised programs, it could have an adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives\nA student may only use Title IV Program funds to pay the costs associated with enrollment in an eligible educational program offered by an institution participating in Title IV Programs. Our expansion plans are based, in part, on our ability to add new educational programs at our existing institutions. Generally, an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, and is not provisionally certified, may obtain ED approval if the new program is licensed by the applicable state agency and accredited by an agency recognized by ED. However, ED, or state education agencies, and our accreditor could decline to approve a new program, or impose material conditions or restrictions on us. Any such denial or material limitation could have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company or any of our schools, our ability to participate in Title IV Programs may be impaired.\nIf we or any of our schools experience a change of control under the standards of applicable federal and state agencies, our accrediting commission or ED, we or the affected schools must seek the approval of the relevant regulatory agencies. These agencies do not have uniform criteria for what constitutes a change of control. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of our common stock or significant changes in the composition of our board of directors. Some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from ED, our accrediting commission or any state in which our schools are located would impair our ability to participate in Title IV Programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our academic or operational initiatives, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in obtaining, approval of any change of control from any state in which we do not have a school but in which we recruit students could require us to suspend our recruitment of students in that state until we receive the required approval. The potential adverse effects of a change of control with respect to participation in Title IV Programs could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nPublic health pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) emerged in Wuhan, China. While initially concentrated in China, the outbreak has spread to other countries and infections have been reported globally including in the United States. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak to be a pandemic, the United States had declared a state of national emergency, and many state and local governments are continuing to take various actions to combat the spread of the virus. The extent to which COVID-19, like any other rapidly spreading contagious illness, may impact our business and operations will depend on the evolution of the outbreak, which is highly speculative at this time and cannot be predicted with any level of certainty. The duration of the outbreak, new information which emerges concerning the severity of the illness and the actions to be taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 or its treatment remains unclear. We believe that the continued spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact our business and operations. In addition, a quarantine of one or more of our faculty members for two or more weeks due to exposure to COVID-19 or other contagious illness could eliminate a program unless a substitute was readily available and quarantine of a faculty member or student could cause the temporary closure of an affected campus which could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results. Further, workforce limitations and travel restrictions resulting from pandemics or disease outbreaks and related government actions may impact many aspects of our business. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks, our operations and enrollment may be negatively impacted. Finally, state and federal regulators, including the ED, are augmenting existing regulatory processes, waiving others, and overseeing various emergency relief and aid programs. It is highly uncertain how long such regulatory accommodations will continue, or how long and in what amount emergency relief and aid funds will continue to be available. We also cannot predict the types of conditions that may be attached to participation in emergency relief and aid programs, and whether and to what extent compliance with such conditions will be monitored and enforced.\nOn March 19, 2020, we suspended all in-person classes at all of our campuses for the safety and protection of our students and staff, to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and to comply with state and local orders and restrictions. Upon the suspension of all in-person classes, we provided all students with the opportunity to take a leave of absence or to continue their education via an online curriculum. On March 25, 2020, we began offering the classroom portion of our training online so that the more than 8,000 students who elected to remain active in the program could continue their education remotely. As our training is a combination of classroom lectures and hands-on labs, there is a portion of most classes that cannot be delivered online and needs to be completed in-person at the campus labs.\nWe transitioned our on-campus, in-person education model to a blended training model that combines instructor-facilitated online teaching and demonstrations with hands-on labs. On-campus labs have been redesigned to meet the health, safety and social distancing guidelines imposed by the CDC and state and local jurisdictions, while still meeting our accreditation and curriculum requirements. In May 2020, we resumed in-person labs at eight of our campus locations. Four of our campuses resumed in-person labs in June 2020, and our final campus in Bloomfield, New Jersey resumed in-person labs on July 1, 2020.\nOnce a student returns to campus for in-person labs, under the new guidelines it takes on average approximately six to nine weeks for that student to catch-up on the lab work that he was unable to complete during the campus closure and prior to his return. Additionally, some students have not returned to campus to complete the in-person labs and remain only in the online portion of the curriculum, essentially only completing half of each course, while others are completing catch-up labs, but over an extended period of time. We continue to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the course or program offered, taking into consideration those only completing the online curriculum, and the catch-up period for active students and the impact it has on expected graduation dates. As a result, as of September 30, 2020, we deferred revenue of $6.1 million.\nWhile we have reopened all of our campus locations, some students have delayed returning to campus for in-person labs even with the new social distancing protocols in place and remain on leave of absence or continue only with the online instruction portion of the curriculum. If students continue to remain on a leave of absence, withdraw, or do not make up the required in person labs on a timely basis, our revenues could continue to be impacted in fiscal 2021.\nMacroeconomic conditions and aversion to debt could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our enrollment is affected by changes in economic conditions, although the nature and magnitude of this effect are uncertain and may change over time. Enrollment tends to be counter cyclical, and the strength or weakness of the economy directly impacts us. During periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable, prospective students have more employment options and recruiting new students has traditionally been more challenging. Affordability concerns associated with increased living expenses, relocation expenses and the availability of full- and part-time jobs for students attending classes have made it more challenging for us to attract and retain students.\nConversely, an increase in the unemployment rate and weaker macroeconomic conditions could reduce the willingness of employers to sponsor educational opportunities for their employees and affect the ability of our students to find employment in the industries that we serve, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse market conditions for consumer and federally guaranteed student loans could negatively impact the ability of borrowers with little or poor credit history, such as many of our students, to borrow the necessary funds at an acceptable interest rate. These events could adversely affect the ability or willingness of our former students to repay student loans, which could increase our student loan cohort default rate and require increased time, attention and resources to manage these defaults.\nCompetition could decrease our market share and create tuition pricing concerns.\nThe postsecondary education market is highly competitive. We continue to experience a high level of competition for higher quality students not only from similar programs, but also from the overall employment market and the military. Some traditional public and private colleges and universities and community colleges, as well as other private career-oriented schools, offer programs that may be perceived by students to be similar to ours. We compete with local community colleges for students seeking programs that are similar to ours, mainly due to local accessibility, low tuition rates and in certain cases free tuition. Most public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to for-profit schools.\nProspective students may choose to forego additional education and enter the workforce directly, especially during periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable as it has in recent years. This may include employment with our industry partners or with other manufacturers and employers of our graduates. Additionally, the military often recruits or retains potential students when branches of the military offer enlistment or re-enlistment bonuses.\nWe may limit tuition increases or increase spending in response to competition in order to retain or attract students or pursue new market opportunities; however, if we cannot effectively respond to competitor changes, it could reduce our enrollments and our student populations. We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not adversely affect our market share, revenues and operating margin.\nOur financial performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop awareness and acceptance of our programs among high school graduates, military personnel and adults seeking advanced training.\nThe awareness of our programs among high school graduates, military personnel and working adults seeking advanced training is critical to the continued acceptance and growth of our programs. Our inability to continue to develop awareness of our programs could reduce our enrollments, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. The following are some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully marketing our programs:\n\u2022availability of funding sources acceptable to our students;\n\u2022recruitment of veterans or other potential students without formal education by our industry partners and other manufacturers;\n\u2022our failure to maintain or expand our brand or other factors related to our marketing or advertising practices;\n\u2022diminished access to high school student populations, including school district limitations on access to students by for-profit institutions;\n\u2022reduced access to military bases and installations;\n\u2022our inability to maintain relationships with automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle and marine manufacturers and suppliers; and\n\u2022student dissatisfaction with our programs and services.\nFailure on our part to maintain and expand existing industry relationships and develop new industry relationships with our industry customers could impair our ability to attract and retain students.\nWe have extensive industry relationships that we believe afford us significant competitive strength and support our market leadership. These relationships enable us to support enrollment in our core programs by attracting students through brand name recognition and the associated prospect of high-quality employment opportunities. Additionally, these relationships allow us to diversify funding sources, expand the scope and increase the number of programs we offer and reduce our costs and capital expenditures due to the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the underlying contracts with manufacturer brand partners, we provide a variety of specialized training programs and typically do so using tools, equipment and vehicles provided by the manufacturer brand partners. These relationships also provide additional incremental revenue opportunities from training the employees of our industry customers. Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand our existing industry relationships and to enter into new industry relationships. Certain of our existing industry relationships, including those with American Honda Motor Company, Inc.; Mercury Marine, a division of Brunswick Corporation; Volvo Penta of the Americas, Inc. and Yamaha Motor Corporation, USA, are not memorialized in writing and are based on verbal understandings. As a result, the rights of the parties under these arrangements are less clearly defined than they would be had they been in writing. Additionally, certain of our written agreements may be terminated without cause by the OEM. Finally, certain of our existing industry relationship agreements expire within the next six months. We are currently negotiating to renew these agreements and intend to renew them to the extent we can do so on satisfactory terms. The reduction or elimination of, or failure to renew any of our existing industry relationships, or our failure to enter into new industry relationships, could impair our ability to attract and retain students, require additional capital expenditures or increase expenses and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop and integrate new programs in a cost-effective manner and on a timely basis.\nProspective employers of our graduates demand that their entry-level employees possess appropriate technological skills. These skills are becoming more sophisticated in line with technological advancements in the automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle and marine industries. Accordingly, educational programs at our schools must keep pace with those technological advancements. Additionally, the method used to deliver curriculum has evolved to include online delivery. The updates to our existing programs and the development of new programs, and changes in the method in which we deliver them, may not be accepted by our students, prospective employers or the technical education market. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as the industries we serve require or as quickly as our competitors. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our graduate employment rates could suffer.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to address and respond to requirements for new or updated curricula such as training instructors to teach the curricula, obtaining the appropriate equipment to teach the curricula to our students, or obtaining the appropriate regulatory approvals, we may not be able to successfully roll out the curricula to our campuses in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we are not able to effectively and efficiently integrate curricula, this could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nGrowing our online academic programs could be difficult for us.\nThe expansion of our existing online programs and the creation of new online programs may not be accepted by students or employers, or by government regulators or accreditation agencies. In addition, our efforts may be materially adversely affected by increased competition in the online education market or because of problems with the performance or reliability of our online program infrastructure. There is also increasing development of online programs by traditional universities, both in the public and private sectors, which may have more consumer acceptance than programs we develop because of lower pricing or perception of greater value of their degrees in the marketplace, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are heavily dependent on the reliability and performance of an internally developed student management and reporting system, and any difficulties in maintaining this system may result in service interruptions, decreased customer service or increased expenditures.\nThe software that underlies our student management and reporting has been developed primarily by our own employees. The reliability and continuous availability of this internal system and related integrations are critical to our business. Any interruptions that hinder our ability to timely deliver our services, or that materially impact the efficiency or cost with which we provide these services, or our ability to attract and retain computer programmers with knowledge of the appropriate computer programming language, would adversely affect our reputation and profitability and our ability to conduct business and prepare financial reports. Additionally, many of the software systems we currently use will need to be enhanced over time or replaced with equivalent commercial products, either of which could entail considerable effort and expense.\nSystem disruptions and security threats to our computer networks, including breach of the personal information we collect, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nOur computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to interruption, malfunction or damage due to events beyond our control, including malicious human acts committed by foreign or domestic persons, natural disasters, and network and communications failures. We have established a written data breach incident response policy, which we test informally and formally at least annually. Additionally, we periodically perform vulnerability self-assessments and engage service providers to perform independent vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. However, despite network security measures, our servers and the servers at our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. Increasing socioeconomic and political instability in some countries has heightened these risks. Despite the precautions we and our service providers have taken, our systems may still be vulnerable to these threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations.\nAdditionally, the personal information that we collect subjects us to additional risks and costs that could harm our business and our reputation. We collect, retain and use personal information regarding our students and their families and our employees, including personally identifiable information, tax return information, financial data, bank account information and other data. Although we employ various network and business security measures to limit access to and use of such personal information, we cannot guarantee that a third party will not circumvent such security measures, resulting in the breach, loss or theft of the personal information of our students and their families and our employees. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could restrict our use of personal information and require notification of data breaches. A violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection, retention or use of personal information could also result in the imposition of fines or lawsuits against us.\nSustained or repeated system failures or security breaches that interrupt our ability to process information in a timely manner or that result in a breach of proprietary or personal information could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our reputation. Although we maintain insurance in respect of these types of events, available insurance proceeds may not be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these events.\nWe may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur success to date has depended, and will continue to depend, largely on the skills, efforts and motivation of our executive officers who generally have significant experience with our company and within the technical education industry. Our success also depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty, campus presidents, administrators and corporate management. Due to the nature of our business and our operating results in recent years, we face significant competition in the attraction and retention of personnel who possess the skill sets that we seek. The for-profit education sector is under significant regulatory and government scrutiny, which may make it more difficult to attract and retain talent. If we are unable to, or are perceived to be unable to, attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, key personnel may leave us and subsequently compete against us. Because we do not currently carry \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance, the loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could impair our ability to successfully manage our business.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain and continue to develop and train our admissions representatives, the effectiveness of our student recruiting efforts would be adversely affected.\nIn order to support revenue growth and student enrollment, we need to hire and train new admissions representatives, as well as retain and continue to develop our existing admissions representatives, who are our employees dedicated to student recruitment. Our ability to develop a strong admissions representative team may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022the competition we face from other companies in hiring;\n\u2022consumer trends causing certain sectors (other than for-profit, postsecondary education) to experience significant growth in less regulated environments with the potential to offer higher compensation;\n\u2022our ability to compensate admissions representatives while remaining compliant with ED regulations related to incentive compensation;\n\u2022our ability to assimilate and motivate our admissions representatives;\n\u2022our ability to effectively train our admissions representatives;\n\u2022the length of time it takes new admissions representatives to become productive; and\n\u2022our ability to effectively manage a multi-location educational organization.\nIf we are unable to hire, develop or retain quality admissions representatives, the effectiveness of our student recruiting efforts would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to improve our underutilized capacity, we may experience a deterioration of our profitability and operating margins.\nWe have underutilized capacity at a number of our campuses. Our ongoing efforts to fill or reduce existing capacity may strain our management, operations, employees or other resources. We may not be able to maintain our current capacity utilization rates, effectively manage our operations or achieve planned capacity utilization on a timely or profitable basis. If we are unable to improve our underutilized capacity, we may experience operating inefficiencies at a level that would result in higher than anticipated costs, which would adversely affect our profitability and operating margins.\nOur success depends, in part, on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs in recruiting new students.\nIn order to maintain and increase our revenues and margins, we must continue to develop our admissions programs and attract new students in a cost-effective manner. The level of marketing and advertising and types of strategies used are affected by the specific geographic markets, regulatory compliance requirements and the specific individual nature of each institution and its students. The complexity of these marketing efforts contributes to their cost. If we are unable to advertise and market our institutions and programs successfully, our ability to attract and enroll new students could be materially adversely affected and, consequently, our financial performance could suffer. We use marketing tools such as the Internet, radio, television and print media advertising to promote our institutions and programs. Our representatives also make presentations at high schools and career fairs. Additionally, we rely on the general reputation of our institutions and referrals from current students, alumni and employers as a source of new enrollment. As part of our marketing and advertising, we also subscribe to lead-generating databases in certain markets, the cost of which may increase. Among the factors that could\nprevent us from marketing and advertising our institutions and programs successfully are the failure of our marketing tools and strategies to appeal to prospective students, regulatory constraints on marketing, current student and/or employer dissatisfaction with our program offerings or results and diminished access to high school campuses and military bases. In order to maintain our growth, we will need to attract a larger percentage of students in existing markets and increase our addressable market by adding locations in new markets and rolling out new academic programs. Any failure to accomplish this may have a material adverse effect on our future growth.\nFailure on our part to effectively identify, establish and operate additional schools or campuses could reduce our ability to implement our growth strategy.\nAs part of our business strategy, we anticipate opening and operating new schools or campuses. Establishing new schools or campuses poses unique challenges and requires us to make investments in management and capital expenditures, incur marketing expenses and devote other resources that are different, and in some cases greater, than those required with respect to the operation of acquired schools. Accordingly, when we open new schools, initial investments could reduce our profitability. To open a new school or campus, we would be required to obtain appropriate state and accrediting commission approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. Additionally, to be eligible for Title IV Program funding, a new school or campus would have to be certified by ED. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify suitable expansion opportunities to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate or that we will be able to successfully integrate or profitably operate any new schools or campuses. Our failure to effectively identify, establish, license, accredit, obtain necessary approvals and manage the operations of newly established schools or campuses could slow our growth and make any newly established schools or campuses more costly to operate than we have historically experienced.\nWe may be unable to successfully complete or integrate future acquisitions.\nWe may consider selective acquisitions in the future. We may not be able to complete any acquisitions on favorable terms or, even if we do, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our business. Integration challenges include, among others, regulatory approvals, significant capital expenditures, assumption of known and unknown liabilities, our ability to control costs and our ability to integrate new personnel. The successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the senior management of the acquired schools, which could decrease the time that they devote to the day-to-day management of our business. If we do not successfully address risks and challenges associated with acquisitions, including integration, future acquisitions could harm, rather than enhance, our operating performance. Additionally, if we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. A future acquisition could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in interest expense, amortization expenses, goodwill and other intangible assets, charges relating to integration costs or an increase in the number of shares outstanding. In addition, our acquisition of a school is a change of ownership of that school, which may result in the temporary suspension of that school\u2019s participation in federal student financial aid programs until it obtains ED\u2019s approval. These results could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition or result in dilution to current stockholders.\nOur proprietary loan program could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nOur proprietary loan program enables students who have utilized all available government-sponsored or other financial aid and have not been successful in obtaining private loans from other financial institutions, for independent students, or PLUS loans, for dependent students, to borrow a portion of their tuition if they meet certain criteria.\nUnder our proprietary loan program, the bank originates loans for our students who meet our specific credit criteria with the related proceeds to be used exclusively to fund a portion of their tuition. We then purchase all such loans from the bank at least monthly and assume all the related credit and collection risk. See Note 2 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements within Part II. Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of activity under our proprietary loan program.\nFactors that may impact our ability to collect these loans include the following, without limitation: current economic conditions; compliance with laws applicable to the origination, servicing and collection of loans; the quality of our loan servicers\u2019 performance; and a decline in graduate employment opportunities and the priority that the borrowers under this loan program attach to repaying these loans as compared to other obligations, particularly students who did not complete or were dissatisfied with their programs of study.\nThe portion of a student's tuition revenue related to the proprietary loan program is considered a form of variable consideration. We estimate the amount we ultimately expect to collect from the portion of tuition that is funded by the proprietary loan program, resulting in a note receivable. The estimated amount is determined at the inception of the contract, and we recognize the related revenue as the student progresses through school. Each reporting period, we update our assessment of the variable consideration associated with the proprietary loan program. Estimating the collection rate requires significant management judgment. If we are unable to accurately assess the variable consideration, our revenues and profitability may be adversely impacted.\nFederal, state and local laws and general legal and equitable principles relating to the protection of consumers can apply to the origination, servicing and collection of the loans under our proprietary loan program. Any violation of various federal, state or local laws, including, in some instances, violations of these laws by parties not under our control, may result in losses on the loans or may limit our ability to collect all or part of the principal or interest on the loans. This may be the case even if we are not directly responsible for the violations by such parties.\nOur proprietary loan program may also be subject to oversight by the CFPB, which could result in additional reporting requirements or increased scrutiny. Other proprietary postsecondary institutions have been subject to information requests from the CFPB with regard to their private student loan programs. The possibility of litigation, and the associated cost, are risks associated with our proprietary loan program. At least two proprietary education institutions have been subject to lawsuits under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010; the institutions are accused of having unfair private student loan programs and of allegedly engaging in certain abusive practices, including interfering with students' ability to understand their debt obligations and failing to provide certain material information.\nChanges in laws or public policy could negatively impact the viability of our proprietary loan program and cause us to delay or suspend the program. Additionally, depending on the terms of the loans, state consumer credit regulators may assert that our activities in connection with our proprietary loan program require us to obtain one or more licenses, registrations or other forms of regulatory approvals, any of which may not be able to be obtained in a timely manner, if at all. All of these factors could result in our proprietary loan program having a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to originate, process and service loans under our proprietary loan program. If these companies fail or discontinue providing such services, our business could be harmed.\nA state chartered bank with a small market capitalization originates loans under our proprietary loan program. If the bank no longer provides service under the contract, we do not currently have an alternative bank to fulfill the demand. There are a limited number of banks that are willing to participate in a program such as our proprietary loan program. The time it could take us to replace the bank could result in an interruption in the loan origination process, which could result in a decrease in our student populations. Furthermore, a single company processes loan applications and services the loans under our proprietary loan program. There is a 90-day termination clause in the contract under which they provide these services. If this company were to terminate the contract, we could experience an interruption in loan application processing or loan servicing, which could result in a decrease in our student populations.\nWe have goodwill, which may become impaired and subject to a write-down.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, which might result from the deterioration in the operating performance of acquired businesses, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances. Any resulting impairment charge is recognized as an expense in the period in which impairment is identified. Our total recorded goodwill of $8.2 million as of September 30, 2020 relates to our MMI Orlando, Florida campus and resulted from the acquisition of our motorcycle and marine education business in 1998. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Future assessments of goodwill could result in reductions. Any reduction in net income and operating income resulting from the write-down or impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial results. If economic or industry conditions deteriorate or if market valuations decline, including with respect to our common stock, we may be required to impair goodwill in future periods.\nRisks Related to Investing in Our Common Stock\nHolders of our Series A Preferred Stock own a significant percentage of our capital stock, are able to influence and control certain corporate matters and could in the future substantially dilute the ownership interest of holders of our common stock.\nOn June 24, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the \u201cColiseum Securities Purchase Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which we sold 700,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Coliseum Holdings I, LLC (\u201cColiseum Holdings\u201d), and filed a Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cCertificate of Designations\u201d) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Certificate of Designations authorized a total of 700,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, all of which were purchased by Coliseum Holdings, and set forth the negotiated rights, powers, preferences and privileges of the Series A Preferred Stock, including the terms of a Conversion Cap and an Investor Voting Cap (each as defined in the Certificate of Designations), which generally prohibit: (i) the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock; and (ii) the voting of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent that such conversion results in the issuance of a number of shares of common stock exceeding 4.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of June 24, 2016 or that has voting power that exceeds 4.99% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock as of June 24, 2016.\nThe Certificate of Designations provides that the Conversion Cap and the Investor Voting Cap may only be removed upon our receipt of: (i) certain stockholder approvals required by Section 312.03 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (\u201cNYSE Rule 312\u201d); and (ii) either (A) Education Regulatory Approval (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), or (B) a good faith determination by our board of directors that Education Regulatory Approval is not required. Our stockholders approved a proposal at the annual meeting of stockholders on February 27, 2020, in accordance with the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), that satisfied NYSE Rule 312.\nIn September 2020, Coliseum Holdings distributed all of its 700,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to its members, who subsequently distributed their shares to (i) limited partners affiliated with Coliseum Holdings and certain other entities for whom Coliseum Capital Management, LLC (an affiliate of Coliseum Holdings) holds voting and dispositive power with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cAffiliated Holders\u201d), which Affiliated Holders, following such distribution, owned Series A Preferred Stock that represented, on an as converted basis, approximately 24.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock and voting power, and (ii) limited partners unaffiliated with Coliseum Holdings (the \u201cUnaffiliated Holders\u201d), which Unaffiliated Holders, following such distribution, each owned shares of Series A Preferred Stock that represented, on an as converted basis, 9.9% or less of our outstanding shares of common stock and voting power (collectively, the \u201cDistributions\u201d).\nIn connection with the Distributions, our board of directors made a good faith determination that: (i) no Education Regulatory Approval would be required for the Unaffiliated Holders to remove the Conversion Cap and the Investor Voting Cap with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock acquired in the Distributions; and (ii) as to the Series A Preferred Stock held by the Affiliated Holders, no Education Regulatory Approval would be required prior to the Affiliated Holders (A) converting a number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock provided that the number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to such conversion, in the aggregate, is less than or equal to 9.9% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on an as converted basis as of the date of the Distributions, and (B) voting a number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock provided that the voting power of such Series A Preferred Stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of such Series A Preferred Stock is less than or equal to 9.9% of the voting power of the common stock outstanding as of the date of the Distributions (the foregoing limitations, the \u201cContinuing Caps\u201d).\nIn September 2020, the Distributions were completed and the removal of the Conversion Cap and Investor Voting Cap became effective, subject to the Continuing Caps remaining in place with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock distributed to the Affiliated Holders. Education Regulatory Approval continues to be required for, and the Continuing Caps will remain in place with respect to, the Series A Preferred Stock acquired by the Affiliated Holders in the Distributions to the extent such shares, on an as converted basis, represent in excess of 9.9% of our common stock and voting power as of the date of the Distributions. The Affiliated Holders may, at any time, request that we seek Education Regulatory Approval or make a good faith determination that such approval is not required. If we are required to or elect to obtain Education Regulatory Approval and if such approvals are not obtained within the 120-day time period set forth in the Certificate of Designations, the dividend rates with respect to the Cash Dividend and Accrued Dividend (each as defined in the Certificate of Designations) will be increased by 5.0% per year, not to exceed a maximum of 14.5% per year, subject to downward adjustment on obtaining the foregoing approvals\nAs of September 30, 2020, as a result of the removal of the Conversion Cap and the Investor Voting Cap, the Unaffiliated Holders and the Affiliated Holders were entitled to vote their Series A Preferred Stock in an amount equal to 12,968,878 shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis. Those holders may also convert such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and receive approximately 30.03 shares of common stock for each share of Series A Preferred Stock converted, resulting in our issuance of up to 12,968,878 shares of common stock if such shares of Series A Preferred Stock were all converted. On a fully converted basis, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into 21,021,021 shares of common stock. Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of shares of common stock and any other class or series similarly entitled to vote with the holders of common stock and not as a separate class, at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, and may act by written consent in the same manner as the holders of common stock, on an as converted basis. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible to common stock at any time at the option of the holder, subject to the Continuing Caps.\nAny conversion of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We have granted Coliseum Holdings and certain recipients of Series A Preferred Stock in the Distributions registration rights in respect of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion thereof. These registration rights could facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any resale of these securities would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, a majority of the voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock must approve certain significant corporate actions, such as (i) amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws in a manner adverse to the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) the creation or issuance of a series of stock, or other security convertible into a series of stock, with equal or greater rights than those of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, (iii) the issuance of equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, at a price that is 25% below fair market value at the time of issuance, (iv) subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of indebtedness, (v) subject to certain exceptions, the sale or licensing of any of our material assets, (vi) subject to certain exceptions, the consummation of acquisitions (of stock or assets), (vii) subject to certain exceptions, the payment of certain dividends or distributions with respect to a series of stock junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, (viii) the voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of UTI if the Series A Preferred Stock would not have the option to receive the liquidation preference then in effect upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or (ix) subject to certain exceptions, any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification or other transaction in which substantially all of our common stock is exchanged or converted into cash, securities or property and in which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have the option to receive the full liquidation preference as a result of that transaction.\nThe interests of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders and Coliseum Holdings\u2019 concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of UTI otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and may continue to fluctuate significantly for a variety of different reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u2022developments regarding the accreditation or state licensing;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022public reaction to our press releases, corporate communications and SEC filings;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022seasonal variations in our student enrollment;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our industry or business;\n\u2022negative publicity, including government hearings and other public lawmaker or regulator criticism, regarding our industry or business;\n\u2022changes in enrollment;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022litigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors;\n\u2022sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders; and\n\u2022changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from health epidemics, war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. Changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company.\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn reviewing our results of operations, you should not focus on quarter-to-quarter comparisons. Our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year. Our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business, principally due to changes in total student population. Student population varies as a result of new student enrollments, graduations and student attrition. Historically, our schools have had lower student populations in our third fiscal quarter than in the remainder of our fiscal year because fewer students are enrolled during the summer months. Our expenses, however, do not generally vary at the same rate as changes in our student population and revenues and, as a result, such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. We expect quarterly fluctuations in results of operations to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns. Such patterns may change, however, as a result of acquisitions, new school openings, new program introductions and increased enrollments of adult students. Additionally, our revenues for our first fiscal quarter are adversely affected by the fact that we do not recognize revenue during the calendar year-end holiday break, which falls primarily in that quarter. These fluctuations may result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89973, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "UTI"}
