{"cik": "876883", "company": "MDC PARTNERS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, results of operations or financial condition. See also \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe pending preferred equity financing may not be completed, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition or the price of our Class A shares.\nOn February 14, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Broad Street Principal Investments, L.L.C., an affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (the \u201cPurchaser\u201d), pursuant to which we have agreed to issue and sell to the Purchaser and the Purchaser has agreed to purchase 95,000 newly authorized Series 4 convertible preference shares for an aggregate purchase price of $95.0 million (the \u201cPreference Shares\u201d). The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Although the Purchase Agreement requires the parties to use reasonable efforts to consummate the transaction, we cannot assure you that all closing conditions will be satisfied or waived. The Purchase Agreement will expire if the closing has not occurred by the sixtieth day following the date of the Purchase Agreement. If the transaction is not completed, we will be subject to a number of risks, including: we must pay costs related to the transaction, including legal and financial advisory fees, whether the transaction is completed or not; the trading price of our Class A shares may decline if the transaction is not completed, to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be completed; we may be required to seek alternative sources of liquidity, as to the availability or terms of which we cannot provide assurance, and we could be subject to litigation related to the failure to complete the transaction or other factors, all of which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial results and the price of our Class A shares.\nFuture economic and financial conditions could adversely impact our financial condition and results.\nAdvertising, marketing and communications expenditures are sensitive to global, national and regional macroeconomic conditions, as well as specific budgeting levels and buying patterns. Adverse developments including heightened uncertainty could reduce the demand for our services, which could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and financial position in 2017.\na. As a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.\nGlobal economic conditions affect the advertising and marketing services industry more severely than other industries. In the past, some clients have responded to weakening economic conditions with reductions to their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. This pattern may recur in the future. Decreases in our revenue would negatively affect our financial results, including a reduction of our estimates of free cash flow from operations.\nb. If our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results.\nWe have a diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. The unfavorable economic and financial conditions that have impacted many sectors of the global economy could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. The direct impact on us could include\nreduced revenues and write offs of accounts receivable. If these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of goodwill, covenant violations relating to MDC\u2019s senior secured revolving credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) or the $900 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% notes due 2024 (the \u201c6.50% Notes\u201d), or reduced liquidity. Our ten largest clients (measured by revenue generated) accounted for 23% of our revenue in 2016.\nc. Conditions in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nTurmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit would make it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements and could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors, including us. If that were to occur, it could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nMDC competes for clients in highly competitive industries.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment in an industry characterized by numerous firms of varying sizes, with no single firm or group of firms having a dominant position in the marketplace. MDC is, however, smaller than several of its larger industry competitors. Competitive factors include creative reputation, management, personal relationships, quality and reliability of service and expertise in particular niche areas of the marketplace. In addition, because a firm\u2019s principal asset is its people, barriers to entry are minimal, and relatively small firms are, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client\u2019s business from a larger competitor.\nWhile many of MDC\u2019s client relationships are long-standing, companies put their advertising and marketing services businesses up for competitive review from time to time, including at times when clients enter into strategic transactions or experienced senior management changes. From year to year, the identities of MDC\u2019s ten largest customers may change, as a result of client losses and additions and other factors. To the extent that the Company fails to maintain existing clients or attract new clients, MDC\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results may be affected in a materially adverse manner.\nThe loss of lines of credit under the Credit Agreement could adversely affect MDC\u2019s liquidity and our ability to implement MDC\u2019s acquisition strategy and fund any put options if exercised.\nMDC uses amounts available under the Credit Agreement, together with cash flow from operations, to fund its working capital needs, to fund the exercise of put option obligations and to fund our strategy of making selective acquisitions of ownership interests in entities in the marketing communications services industry, including through contingent deferred acquisition payments.\nThe Company is currently in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. If, however, events were to occur, which result in MDC losing all or a substantial portion of its available credit under the Credit Agreement, or if MDC was prevented from accessing such lines of credit due to other restrictions such as those in the indenture governing the 6.50% Notes, MDC could be required to seek other sources of liquidity. In addition, if MDC were unable to replace this source of liquidity, then MDC\u2019s ability to fund its working capital needs and any contingent obligations with respect to put options or contingent deferred acquisition payments would be materially adversely affected.\nWe have significant contingent obligations related to deferred acquisition consideration and noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries, which will require us to utilize our cash flow and/or to incur additional debt to satisfy.\nThe Company has made a number of acquisitions for which it has deferred payment of a portion of the purchase price, usually for a period between one to five years after the acquisition. The deferred acquisition consideration is generally payable based on achievement of certain thresholds of future earnings of the acquired company and, in certain cases, also based on the rate of growth of those earnings. Once any contingency is resolved, the Company may pay the contingent consideration over time.\nThe Company records liabilities on its balance sheet for deferred acquisition payments at their estimated value based on the current performance of the business, which are re-measured each quarter. At December 31, 2016, these aggregate liabilities were $229.6 million, of which $108.3 million, $40.0 million, $40.4 million and $40.8 million would be payable in 2017, 2018, 2019 and thereafter, respectively.\nIn addition to the Company\u2019s obligations for deferred acquisition consideration, managers of certain of the Company\u2019s acquired subsidiaries hold noncontrolling interests in such subsidiaries. In the case of certain noncontrolling interests related to acquisitions, such managers are entitled to a proportionate distribution of earnings from the relevant subsidiary, which is recognized on the Company\u2019s consolidated income statement under \u201cNet income attributable to the noncontrolling interests.\u201d\nNoncontrolling shareholders often have the right to require the Company to purchase all or part of its interest, either at specified dates or upon the termination of such shareholder\u2019s employment with the subsidiary or death (put rights). In addition, the Company usually has rights to call noncontrolling shareholders\u2019 interests at a specified date. The purchase price for both puts and calls is typically calculated based on specified formulas tied to the financial performance of the subsidiary.\nThe Company recorded $60.2 million on its December 31, 2016 balance sheet as redeemable noncontrolling interests for its estimated obligations in respect of noncontrolling shareholder put and call rights based on the current performance of the subsidiaries, $12.5 million of which related to put rights for which, if exercised, the payments are due at specified dates, with the\nremainder of redeemable noncontrolling interests attributable to put or call rights exercisable only upon termination of employment or death. No estimated obligation is recorded on the balance sheet for noncontrolling interests for which the Company has a call right but the noncontrolling holder has no put right.\nPayments to be made by the Company in respect of deferred acquisition consideration and noncontrolling shareholder put rights may be significantly higher than the estimated amounts described above because the actual obligation adjusts based on the performance of the acquired businesses over time, including future growth in earnings from the calculations made at December 31, 2016. Similarly, the payments made by the Company under call rights would increase with growth in earnings of the acquired businesses. The Company expects that deferred contingent consideration and noncontrolling interests for managers may be features of future acquisitions that it may undertake and that it may also grant similar noncontrolling interests to managers of its subsidiaries unrelated to acquisitions.\nThe Company expects that its obligations in respect of deferred acquisition consideration and payments to noncontrolling shareholders under put and call rights will be a significant use of the Company\u2019s liquidity in the foreseeable future, whether in the form of free cash flow or borrowings under the Company\u2019s revolving credit agreement or from other funding sources, including the anticipated proceeds from the issuance and sale of $95.0 million of Preference Shares. For further information, see the disclosure under the heading \u201cBusiness - Ownership Information\u201d and the heading \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nMDC may not realize the benefits it expects from past acquisitions or acquisitions MDC may make in the future.\nMDC\u2019s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of ownership interests in entities in the marketing communications services industry. MDC intends to finance these acquisitions by using available cash from operations and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing shareholders. At any given time MDC may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more material acquisitions. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by MDC. Although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of its securities.\nOur expenses have, in recent periods, increased at a greater rate than revenues, which in part reflects both the increase in expenses for deferred acquisition consideration and from our investment in headcount for certain growth initiatives. Should our acquisitions continue to outperform current expectations, expenses for deferred acquisition consideration could increase as well in future periods. If our growth initiatives do not provide sufficient revenue to offset the incremental costs in future periods, profits could be reduced and severance expense could be incurred in order to return to targeted profit margins over time.\nThe success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses into MDC\u2019s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and clients, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company. MDC may not realize the strategic and financial benefits that it expects from any of its past acquisitions, or any future acquisitions.\nMDC\u2019s business could be adversely affected if it loses key clients or executives.\nMDC\u2019s strategy has been to acquire ownership stakes in diverse marketing communications businesses to minimize the effects that might arise from the loss of any one client or executive. The loss of one or more clients could materially affect the results of the individual Partner Firms and the Company as a whole. Management succession at our operating units is very important to the ongoing results of the Company because, as in any service business, the success of a particular agency is dependent upon the leadership of key executives and management personnel. If key executives were to leave our operating units, the relationships that MDC has with its clients could be adversely affected.\nMDC\u2019s ability to generate new business from new and existing clients may be limited.\nTo increase its revenues, MDC needs to obtain additional clients or generate demand for additional services from existing clients. MDC\u2019s ability to generate initial demand for its services from new clients and additional demand from existing clients is subject to such clients\u2019 and potential clients\u2019 requirements, pre-existing vendor relationships, financial conditions, strategic plans and internal resources, as well as the quality of MDC\u2019s employees, services and reputation and the breadth of its services. To the extent MDC cannot generate new business from new and existing clients due to these limitations, MDC\u2019s ability to grow its business and to increase its revenues will be limited.\nMDC\u2019s business could be adversely affected if it loses or fails to attract key employees.\nEmployees, including creative, research, media, account and practice group specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among MDC\u2019s most important assets. An important aspect of MDC\u2019s competitiveness is its ability to retain key employee and management personnel. Compensation for these key employees is an essential factor in attracting and retaining them, and MDC may not offer a level of compensation sufficient to attract and retain these key employees. If MDC fails to hire and retain\na sufficient number of these key employees, it may not be able to compete effectively. If key executives were to leave our operating units, the relationships that MDC has with its clients could be adversely affected.\nMDC is exposed to the risk of client defaults.\nMDC\u2019s agencies often incur expenses on behalf of their clients for productions in order to secure a variety of media time and space, in exchange for which they receive a fee. The difference between the gross cost of the production and media and the net revenue earned by us can be significant. While MDC takes precautions against default on payment for these services (such as credit analysis and advance billing of clients) and has historically had a very low incidence of default, MDC is still exposed to the risk of significant uncollectible receivables from our clients. The risk of a material loss could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn. Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nMDC\u2019s results of operations are subject to currency fluctuation risks.\nAlthough MDC\u2019s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a portion of its revenues and operating costs are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, may affect MDC\u2019s financial results and competitive position.\nGoodwill and intangible assets may become impaired.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP resulting from our acquisition activities, which principally represents the specialized know-how of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired. We test, at least annually, the carrying value of goodwill for impairment, as discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. The estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows. As discussed in Note 2 and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we have recorded goodwill impairment of $48.5 million. We have concluded for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 that our goodwill and intangible assets relating to continuing operations are not impaired. Future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2016, a goodwill write off of $0.8 million was included in other income (expense) related to the sale of its ownership interests in Bryan Mills Iradesso Corporation (\u201cBryan Mills\u201d) to the noncontrolling shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2014, a goodwill write off of $15.6 million was included in the loss from discontinued operations as a result of MDC\u2019s decision to strategically sell the net assets of Accent Marketing Services, L.L.C. (\u201cAccent\u201d).\nMDC is subject to regulations and litigation risk that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our revenues.\nAdvertising and marketing communications businesses are subject to government regulation, both domestic and foreign. There has been an increasing tendency in the United States on the part of advertisers to resort to litigation and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive. Moreover, there has recently been an expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures, and warning requirements with respect to advertising for certain products and the usage of personally identifiable information. Representatives within government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently MDC\u2019s revenues.\nCertain of MDC\u2019s agencies produce software and e-commerce tools for their clients, and these product offerings have become increasingly subject to litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we expand these product offerings, the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations and may result in us deciding to enter into license agreements to avoid ongoing patent litigation costs. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop offering these services, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our clients. Such arrangements may cause our operating margins to decline.\nIn addition, laws and regulations related to user privacy, use of personal information and internet tracking technologies have been proposed or enacted in the United States and certain international markets. These laws and regulations could affect the acceptance of the internet as an advertising medium. These actions could affect our business and reduce demand for certain of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems.\nWe rely on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of client marketing and advertising information, developing new business opportunities and processing business transactions. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to system failures and network disruptions, malicious intrusion and random attack.\nWhile we have taken what we believe are prudent measures to protect our data and information technology systems, we cannot assure you that our efforts will prevent system failures or network disruptions or breaches in our systems. Any such breakdowns or breaches in our systems or data-protection policies could adversely affect our reputation or business.\nThe Company is subject to an ongoing securities class action litigation claim and a government investigation.\nThe Company remains subject to an ongoing securities class action litigation claim in Canada, although the U.S. securities class action was dismissed, with prejudice. We maintain insurance for a lawsuit of this nature; however, our insurance coverage does not apply in all circumstances and may be insufficient to cover the fees and potential damages and/or settlement costs relating to this class action lawsuit. Moreover, adverse publicity associated with this litigation claim could decrease client demand for our partner agencies\u2019 services. As a result, the securities class action lawsuit described in more detail under \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings,\u201d could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and the trading price of our Class A shares.\nIn addition, one of the Company\u2019s subsidiary agencies received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division concerning its ongoing investigation of production practices in the advertising industry. The Company and its subsidiary are fully cooperating with this confidential investigation. Although the ultimate effect of this investigation is inherently uncertain, we do not at this time believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, the ultimate resolution of this investigation could be materially different from our current assessment.\nFuture issuances of equity securities, which may include securities that would rank senior to our Class A shares, may cause dilution to our existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our Class A shares.\nThe market price of our Class A shares could decline as a result of sales of a large number of our Class A shares in the market, or the sale of securities convertible into a large number of our Class A shares. The perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our Class A shares. On February 14, 2017, we entered into the Purchase Agreement pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, we expect to issue 95,000 Series 4 convertible preference shares with an initial aggregate liquidation preference of $95.0 million, which will be convertible into Class A shares or our Series 5 convertible preference shares at an initial conversion price of $10.00 per share. The terms of the Preference Shares will provide that the conversion price may be reduced, which would result in the Preference Shares being convertible into additional Class A shares, upon certain events including distributions on our Class A shares or issuances of additional Class A shares or equity-linked securities at a price less than the then-applicable conversion price. The conversion of the Preference Shares may adversely affect the market price of our Class A shares, and the market price of our Class A shares may be affected by factors, such as whether the market price is near or above the conversion price, that could make conversion of the Preference Shares more likely. In addition, the Preference Shares will rank senior to the Class A shares, which could affect the value of the Class A shares on liquidation or, as a result of contractual provisions, on a change in control transaction. For example, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed with the Purchaser, with certain exceptions, not to become party to certain change in control transactions that are approved by the Board other than a qualifying transaction in which holders of Preference Shares are entitled to receive cash or qualifying listed securities with a value equal to the then-applicable liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends. See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the terms of the Preference Shares.\nAdditionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A shares, and may result in dilution to owners of our Class A shares. Because our decision to issue additional debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future issuances. Also, we cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances of our Class A shares on the market price of our Class A shares.\nThe indenture governing the 6.50% Notes and the Credit Agreement governing our secured line of credit contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nThe indenture governing the 6.50% Notes and the Credit Agreement governing our lines of credit contain various provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to:\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt and issue capital stock;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments or advances;\n\u2022\nrepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nundergo a change in control;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in new lines of business; and\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business in our discretion could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions and other corporate opportunities. The Credit Agreement is subject to various additional covenants, including a senior leverage ratio, a total leverage ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum EBITDA level (as defined). Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these financial tests, and we cannot assure you that they will be met.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations, including the 6.50% Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2016, MDC had $936.4 million, net of debt issuance costs, of indebtedness. In addition, we expect to make additional drawings under the Credit Agreement from time to time. Our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries\u2019 business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet MDC\u2019s debt service and other obligations. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt service obligations, we may need to obtain additional debt, refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets or raise equity. We may not be able to obtain additional debt, refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, to obtain additional debt or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; the lenders under the Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 6.50% Notes;\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to meet our obligations with respect to our contingent deferred acquisition payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to increase our ownership stake in our Partner Firms;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and other activities;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the advertising industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit, particularly in concert with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds or take other actions.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 6.50% Notes permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness subject to certain limitations. If we or our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face could increase.\nWe are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt and pay dividends.\nMDC is a holding company with no operations of our own. Consequently, our ability to service our debt and to pay cash dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. Although our operating subsidiaries have generally agreed to allow us to consolidate and \u201csweep\u201d cash, subject to the timing of payments due to noncontrolling interest holders, any distribution of earnings\nto us from our subsidiaries is contingent upon the subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and various other business considerations. Also, our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of common stock to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.", "PERMNO": 81527, "SIC": 7311, "TIC": "MDCA"}
