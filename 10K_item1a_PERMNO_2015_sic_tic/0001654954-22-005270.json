{"cik": "798081", "company": "LAKELAND INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks before investing in our common stock. These are not the only risks that we may face. If any of the events referred to below actually occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information in this Form 10-K and in the documents we incorporate by reference into this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are subject to risk as a result of our international manufacturing operations.\nBecause most of our products are manufactured at our facilities located in China, Vietnam, Mexico, Argentina and India, our operations are subject to risk inherent in doing business internationally. Such risks include the adverse effects on operations from corruption, war, international terrorism, civil disturbances, political instability, government activities such as border taxes and renegotiation of treaties, deprivation of contract and property rights and currency valuation changes.\nThere is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China and the U.S., that political, diplomatic, military, or other events could result in business disruptions, including increased regulatory enforcement against companies, tariffs, trade embargoes, and export restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of our products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that we earn on our products. Tariffs can also make our products more expensive for customers, which could make our products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer our products and services as designed. These measures can require us to take various actions, including changing suppliers and restructuring business relationships. Changing our operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending. Any of these events could reduce customer demand, increase the cost of our products and services, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 businesses and results of operations.\nA terrorism attack, other geopolitical crisis, or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as the COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak, could negatively impact our domestic and/or international operations.\nOur global operations are susceptible to global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, and natural disasters. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition.\nWe are also susceptible to a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, resulting in millions of confirmed cases identified around the world and in countries in which we conduct business. The outbreak has caused governments to implement quarantines, implement significant restrictions on travel, closed schools and work places, and implement work restrictions, all of which impaired normal business operations of numerous businesses. Globally air travel has been significantly interrupted as has air freight, ocean freight, and even truck deliveries.\nThe impact the invasion of Ukraine, including economic sanctions or additional war or military conflict, as well as potential responses to them by Russia, is currently unknown and they could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, supply chain, suppliers or customers. In addition, the continuation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia could lead to other disruptions, instability and volatility in global markets and industries that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, the availability of raw materials, supplies, freight and labor, currency exchange rates and financial markets, all of which could impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, may cause unfavorable economic or market conditions which could impact demand patterns and/or disrupt global supply chains and manufacturing operations.\nCollectively, these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Pandemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies of developed and emerging markets, potentially resulting in an economic downturn that could affect customers\u2019 demand for our products in certain industrial-based end-markets. The spread of pandemics or disease outbreaks may also disrupt the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations, supply chain, or logistics necessary to import, export and deliver products to our customers. During a pandemic or crisis, applicable laws and response directives could, in some circumstances, adversely affect our ability to operate our plants, or to deliver our products in a timely manner. Some laws and directives may also hinder our ability to move certain products across borders. Economic conditions can also influence order patterns. These factors could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flow. To date, while we have experienced some loss of employee time and reduced core business sales, we have not suffered significant negative effects due to COVID-19, and our manufacturing facilities have been able to operate without shutdown.\nWe have significant international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries. We have business operations in approximately 60 foreign countries. In FY22, more than half of our net sales were made by operations located outside the United States. Those operations are subject to various political, economic and other risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. These risks include the following:\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nchanges in trade policy or tariff regulations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in tax laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nadditional valuation allowances on deferred tax assets due to an inability to generate sufficient profit in certain foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nintellectual property protection difficulties or intellectual property theft;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\ncomplications in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with U.S. laws;\n\u00b7\nforeign privacy laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\ntrade protection measures and price controls;\n\u00b7\ntrade sanctions and embargoes;\n\u00b7\nnationalization and expropriation;\n\u00b7\nincreased international instability or potential instability of foreign governments;\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of worldwide compliance with Lakeland\u2019s anti-bribery policy, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar local laws;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining qualified employees;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to effectively negotiate with labor unions in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nthe need to take extra security precautions for our international operations;\n\u00b7\ncosts and difficulties in managing culturally and geographically diverse international operations; and\n\u00b7\npandemics and similar disasters.\nAny one or more of these risks could have a negative impact on the success of our international operations and, thereby, have a material adverse effect our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations may vary widely from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarterly results of operations have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future. These fluctuations may be caused by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nCurrency volatility;\n\u00b7\nGlobal crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, oil spills, or ebola outbreak;\n\u00b7\nOur expansion of international operations;\n\u00b7\nCompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u00b7\nSeasonal buying patterns resulting from the cyclical nature of the business of some of our customers;\n\u00b7\nChanges in the mix of products and services sold;\n\u00b7\nThe timing of introductions and enhancements of products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nMarket acceptance of new products;\n\u00b7\nTechnological changes in fabrics or production equipment used to make our products;\n\u00b7\nAvailability of raw materials due to unanticipated demand or lack of precursors (oil and gas);\n\u00b7\nChanges in the mix of domestic and international sales; and\n\u00b7\nPersonnel changes.\nThese variations could negatively impact our stock price.\nDisruption in our supply chain or our manufacturing or distribution operations could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. These activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, epidemics, pandemics (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. This interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address.\nBecause we do not have long-term commitments from many of our customers, we must estimate customer demand, and errors in our estimates could negatively impact our inventory levels and net sales.\nOur sales are generally made on the basis of individual purchase orders, which may later be modified or canceled by the customer, rather than on long-term commitments. We have historically been required to place firm orders for fabrics and components with our suppliers prior to receiving an order for our products, based on our forecasts of customer demands. Our sales process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates, causing excess inventory to accrue or a lack of manufacturing capacity when needed. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to or not at all. As a result, we would have excess inventory, which would negatively impact our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would lose sales opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to delivery dates required by our customers because of the lead time needed for us to obtain required materials or to send fabrics to our assembly facilities in China, Vietnam, India, and Mexico.\nWe face competition from other companies, a number of which have substantially greater resources than we do.\nFour of our competitors, DuPont, Honeywell, Ansell and Kimberly Clark, have substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources than we do. In addition, we believe that the barriers to entry in the disposable and reusable garments and gloves markets are relatively low. We cannot assure you that our present competitors or competitors that choose to enter the marketplace in the future will not exert significant competitive pressures.\nOur operations are substantially dependent upon key personnel.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and certain other key personnel, including Charles D. Roberson, our Chief Executive Officer, President and Secretary, Allen E. Dillard, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and Steven L. Harvey, our Executive Vice President for Global Sales and Marketing. The loss of services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any future expansion of our business will depend on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial, marketing, customer service and manufacturing personnel, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnological change could negatively affect sales of our products and our performance.\nThe rapid development of fabric technology continually affects our apparel applications and may directly impact the performance of our products. We cannot assure you that we will successfully maintain or improve the effectiveness of our existing products, nor can we assure you that we will successfully identify new opportunities or continue to have the needed financial resources to develop new fabric or apparel manufacturing techniques in a timely or cost-effective manner. In addition, products manufactured by others may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. These systems may be materially impacted and/or disrupted by information security incidents such as ransomware, malware, viruses, phishing, social engineering, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Security breaches of our systems or security breaches of third parties\u2019 systems on which we rely to process, store, or transmit electronic information, could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data.\nWe employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate cybersecurity threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, management training, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems). However, our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and reputation could be materially adversely affected by these events and any resulting federal and state fines and penalties, legal claims or proceedings. There are also significant costs associated with a data breach, including investigation costs, remediation and mitigation costs, notification costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and the potential for reputational harm and lost revenues due to a loss in confidence. We cannot predict the costs to comply with these laws or the costs associated with a potential data breach, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our business reputation. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to mitigate and alleviate problems caused by security incidents. While no cybersecurity attack to date has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the threat remains.\nData privacy and security laws relating to the handling of personal information are evolving across the world and may be drafted, interpreted or applied in a manner that results in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business.\nFor example, in the United States, individual states regulate data breach notification requirements as well as more general privacy and security requirements. Certain of these laws grant individuals various rights with respect to personal information, and we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with these laws. Further, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted data breach notification laws that impose, in varying degrees, an obligation to notify affected persons and/or state regulators in the event of a data breach or compromise, including when their personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. Some state breach notification laws may also impose physical and electronic security requirements regarding the safeguarding of personal information. Violation of state privacy, security, and breach notification laws can trigger significant monetary penalties. In addition, certain states\u2019 privacy, security, and data breach laws, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d)(amended, effective January 1, 2023 as the California Privacy Rights Act), include private rights of action that may expose us to private litigation regarding our privacy and security practices and significant damages awards or settlements in civil litigation.\nCompliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the United States and around the world may require expenditures and changes in our business models. In addition, government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology, and if we fail to successfully obtain or enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position may be harmed.\nWe rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the U.S. and other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position; however, these patents may be insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights because our patents may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, circumvented, or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products and foreign patents protections may be more limited than those provided under U.S. patents and intellectual property laws.\nWe may not be afforded the protection of a patent if our currently pending or future patent filings do not result in the issuance of patents or we fail to apply for patent protection. We may fail to apply for a patent if our personnel fail to disclose or recognize new patentable ideas or innovations. Remote working can decrease the opportunities for our personnel to collaborate, thereby reducing the opportunities for effective invention disclosures and patent application filings. We may choose not to file a foreign patent application if the limited protections provided by a foreign patent outweigh the costs to obtain it. Our foreign patent portfolio is less extensive than our U.S. portfolio.\nOur inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents, copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth prospects. In particular, a failure to protect our intellectual property rights might allow competitors to copy our technology or create counterfeit or pirated versions of our products, which could adversely affect our reputation, pricing and market share.\nAcquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful.\nIn the future, subject to capital constraints, we may seek to acquire selected safety products lines or safety-related businesses or other businesses, which will complement our existing products. Our ability to acquire these businesses is dependent upon many factors, including our management\u2019s relationship with the owners of these businesses, many of which are small and closely held by individual stockholders. In addition, we will be competing for acquisition and expansion opportunities with other companies, many of which have greater name recognition, marketing support and financial resources than us, which may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us, as well as higher acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, pursue or acquire any targeted business and, if acquired, there can be no assurance that we will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate acquired business into our Company without substantial costs, delays and other operational or financial problems.\nAcquisitions involve a number of special risks in addition to those mentioned above, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies, potential exposure to unknown liabilities, adverse effects on our reported operating results and the amortization or write-down of acquired intangible assets. We cannot assure you that any acquisition by us will or will not occur, that if an acquisition does occur that it will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing our business. To the extent that we are unable to manage growth efficiently and effectively or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOn October 18, 2021, the Company made a strategic investment of $2.8 million in Inova Design Solutions Ltd. (doing business as Bodytrak\u00ae) as a step toward entering the Connected Worker Market for \u201cSmart PPE.\u201d\nFinancial Risks\nOur results of operations could be negatively affected by potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMost of our assembly arrangements with our foreign-based subsidiaries or third-party suppliers require payment to be made in U.S. dollars or the Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d). Any decrease in the value of the US dollar or RMB in relation to foreign currencies could increase the cost of the services provided to us upon contract expirations or supply renegotiations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase product prices to offset any such cost increases, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks as a result of our sales to customers in foreign countries in the amount of $70.8 million in FY22. Our sales in these countries are usually denominated in the local currency. If the value of the US dollar increases relative to these local currencies, and we are unable to raise our prices proportionally, then our profit margins could decrease because of the exchange rate change.\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries. To manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates, we seek to limit, to the extent possible, our non-US dollar denominated purchases and sales.\nIn connection with our operations in China, we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the United States. However, our purchases in China are primarily made in the RMB, the value of which has floated for the last 5 years, therefore we have been exposed to additional foreign exchange rate risk on our Chinese raw material and component purchases.\nOur primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non-US dollar denominated sales in China, Canada and Europe and, to a smaller extent, in South American countries and in Russia. Our sales to customers in Canada are denominated in Canadian dollars, in Europe in Euros and British pounds, and in China in RMB and US dollars. If the value of the US dollar increases relative to the Canadian dollar, the Pound, the Euro, or the RMB then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to these international customers because of changes in rate of exchange. We manage the foreign currency risk, when appropriate, through the use of rolling 90-day forward contracts against the Canadian dollar and Euro and through cash flow hedges in the US against the RMB and the Euro. We do not hedge other currencies at this time. In the event that non-US dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nCovenants in our credit facilities may restrict our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs a result of the Loan Agreement the Company entered into on June 25, 2020 and amended June 18, 2021, we currently have a $25.0 million revolving credit facility, expiring June 25, 2025. Our credit facility requires, and any future credit facilities may also require, among others that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage and investment in acquisitions. Our ability to satisfy these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet the requirements of these covenants.\nAdditionally, in July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would stop compelling banks to submit interest rates for the calculation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021. Although we do not have any outstanding debt under our credit facility, were we to draw on it, the outstanding amounts would bear interest at fluctuating interest rates on an approved replacement benchmark. We continue to monitor this matter and evaluate the related risks and potential impact of LIBOR\u2019s expiration. Any indebtedness that we incur may be indexed to a replacement benchmark, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). Any such change could cause the effective interest rate under an agreement, including our Loan Agreement, and our overall interest expense to increase, adversely affecting our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe may need additional funds, and if we are unable to obtain these funds, we may not be able to expand or operate our business as planned.\nOur operations require significant amounts of cash, and we may be required to seek additional capital, whether from sales of equity or by borrowing money, to fund acquisitions for the future growth and development of our business or to fund our operations and inventory, particularly in the event of a market downturn.\nA number of factors could affect our ability to access future debt or equity financing, including:\n\u00b7\nOur financial condition, strength and credit rating;\n\u00b7\nThe financial markets\u2019 confidence in our management team and financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions and the conditions in the homeland security and Energy sectors; and\n\u00b7\nCapital markets conditions\nEven if available, additional financing may be more costly than our current facility and may have adverse consequences. If additional funds are raised through the incurrence of debt, we will incur increased debt servicing costs and may become subject to additional restrictive financial and other covenants. We can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital. Although management believes it currently has sufficient capital, if we do need additional capital in the future and are unsuccessful, it could reduce our net sales and materially adversely impact our earning capability and financial position.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe deal in countries where corruption is an obstacle.\nWe must comply with American laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Sarbanes-Oxley and also with anticorruption legislation in the U.K. Some of our competitors and customers in foreign jurisdictions may not adhere to such legislation. As a result, we believe that we lose sales orders due to our strict adherence to such regulations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and foreign tax laws and any changes in these laws related to the taxation of businesses and resolutions of tax disputes could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (or, OECD) and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we invest or do business have maintained a focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational companies. The OECD has changed numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project which could adversely impact our effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these claims.\nWe manufacture products used for protection from hazardous or potentially lethal substances, such as chemical and biological toxins, fire, viruses and bacteria. The products that we manufacture are typically used in applications and situations that involve high levels of risk of personal injury. Failure to use our products for their intended purposes, failure to use our products properly or the malfunction of our products could result in serious bodily injury or death of the user. In such cases, we may be subject to product liability claims arising from the design, manufacture or sale of our products. If these claims are decided against us, and we are found to be liable, we may be required to pay substantial damages, and our insurance costs may increase significantly as a result. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover the payment of any potential claim. In addition, we cannot assure you that this or any other insurance coverage will continue to be available or, if available, that we will be able to obtain it at a reasonable cost. Any material uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur US operations, including our manufacturing facilities, are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes. Any violation of any of those laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial liability to the Environmental Protection Agency, the state environmental agencies in any affected state or to any individuals affected by any such violation. If hazardous substances are released from or located on any of our properties, we could incur substantial costs and damages. Any such liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation contains classified board provisions, authorized preferred stock that could be utilized to implement various \u201cpoison pill\u201d defenses and a stockholder authorized, but as yet unused, Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\u201cESOP\u201d), all of which may have the effect of discouraging a takeover of Lakeland, which is not approved by our board of directors. Further, we are subject to the antitakeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in the prescribed manner.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results, announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and other events or factors. For example, a shortfall in net sales or net income, or an increase in losses, from levels expected by securities analysts or investors, could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many micro and small capitalization companies have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nWe are precluded from paying and do not anticipate paying any dividends to our common stockholders in the near future.\nWe are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends to our common stockholders without the prior consent of our lenders. Further, we have not paid dividends on our common stock since August 2006 and we do not anticipate, if permitted, paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing operations.", "PERMNO": 10645, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "LAKE"}
