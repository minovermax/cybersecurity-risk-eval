Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely impact our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nWe may not be able to execute our strategy to successfully transition to a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business strategy is to be a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider for multi-location retail and service businesses. We have taken several steps over the past two years to execute this transformation, including aligning our organization and operating model around four customer categories and decreasing investments in our traditional voice and data products for small business customers to focus on managed network, security and cloud services to larger multi-location businesses. There can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful. The market for managed network, security and cloud services is still relatively new and continues to evolve. If we do not have sufficient customer demand to support our new services, our financial results may be harmed. Our success depends on the timing and market acceptance of our new products and services, our ability to market our services in a cost-effective manner to new customers, our ability to differentiate our services from those of our competitors, our ability to maintain and expand our sales to existing customers, our ability to strengthen awareness of our brand, our ability to hire and train effective personnel, our ability to provide quality implementation and customer support for these products and the reliability and quality of our services. If the market for these services fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, or if our services fail to achieve widespread customer acceptance, our business would suffer. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to increase revenues from our growth products and services to offset declining revenues from our traditional products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nRevenues from our traditional products and services, which include traditional voice and data services for business customers and Internet access services for residential customers, have been declining due to competitive, technological and regulatory developments and we expect these revenues to continue to decline. In addition, we narrowed our product portfolio to provide a more focused suite of services and discontinued sales of certain non-strategic products, including the sale of certain assets associated with our IT services product offerings in February 2016, which increases our revenue decline. To offset our revenue declines, we are focused on continuing to develop our growth products and services; increasing revenues from these products and services; improving the efficiency of our internal processes for offering and delivering our growth products and services; and staying ahead of technology advances such that we are offering competitive and technology relevant products and services. Our growth products and services include MPLS, hosted voice, hybrid WAN and managed network, security and cloud services for multi-location businesses and transport services for wholesale businesses. We may not be successful in our efforts to increase revenues generated from our growth products and services to offset the revenue declines in our traditional products and services. In addition, the sales cycle for our growth products is longer than the sales cycle for our traditional voice and data products, especially as we compete for larger and more complex customers and we have experienced process and system delays related to customer installations. If we are unable to increase sales of our growth products and services to counteract these declining revenues, if we are unable to manage churn, if revenue growth takes longer than expected, if we do not improve the efficiency of our processes or if we do not offer competitive products and services, it could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to adapt to changes in technology and customer demands, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by changing technology, changes in customer needs and frequent new service and product introductions. Our shift in strategy to become a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider increases our exposure to the impact of changes in technology, such as the adoption of cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service, and changes in customer demands, such as the increased demand for data and the increased use of outsourcing. Further changes in technology, such as SD-WAN and other emerging technologies, could also impact our competitiveness in market for managed network services. In addition, changing technology and consumer behavior (such as wireless displacement of wireline use and increasing use of VoIP) impacts demand for our traditional voice and data products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to use leading technologies effectively, to continue to develop our technical expertise, to enhance our existing services and to develop new services that meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost-effective basis. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, customer requirements and industry standards. If the technology choices we make prove to be incorrect,\nineffective or unacceptably costly, we may not be able to compete effectively. In addition, new technologies may be protected by patents or other intellectual property laws, and, therefore, may be available only to our competitors. Any of these items could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to achieve operating efficiencies and otherwise reduce costs would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn light of declining revenues, we have been focused on optimizing our cost structure and maximizing our cash flows. This includes reducing cost of revenues, streamlining our internal processes and right sizing our workforce to current revenue trends. It also includes the repayment and/or refinancing of indebtedness in order to reduce our interest expense. The success of our operating efficiency and cost reduction initiatives is necessary to align costs with declining revenues for traditional voice and data products and to combat pressure non-variable costs place on margins. We have incurred and may continue to incur upfront costs to achieve these efficiency and cost reduction initiatives. In addition, although we have been successful in our efforts to reduce costs over the past few years, we may not be able to continue to achieve this level of cost savings and there will be decreasing opportunities for cost savings in the future. Additionally, we may not be able to continue to repay indebtedness and thereby reduce our interest expense. If we do not recognize the anticipated benefits of our operating efficiency and cost reduction opportunities in a timely manner or they present greater than anticipated costs, our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nWe may have to undertake further restructuring plans that would require additional charges.\nDuring 2015, we incurred restructuring charges as a result of changes to our business strategy and operating structure. We plan to continue to evaluate our business, which may result in additional restructuring activities. We may choose to consolidate or close certain facilities, implement workforce reductions or outsource certain functions. Decisions to engage in future restructuring activities could involve the expenditure of capital, consumption of management resources, realization of losses, transition and wind-up expenses, workforce reductions, impairment of assets and the elimination of revenues along with associated costs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows and may fail to yield the expected benefits.\nWe may be unable to successfully divest non-strategic products, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time we consider the divestiture of non-strategic products, assets and customers based on management's assessment of their strategic value to our business. Divesting certain of our products or assets would be complex operationally due to their interrelationships with assets and products we would desire to retain. Any divestiture also would need to be transacted in accordance with the terms of our debt agreements. Additionally, decisions to divest certain business operations could involve the expenditure of capital, consumption of management resources, realization of losses, transition and wind-up expenses, workforce reductions, impairment of assets and the elimination of revenues along with associated costs, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows and may fail to yield the expected benefits.\nAcquisitions we complete could result in operating difficulties, dilution, increased liabilities, diversion of management attention and other adverse consequences, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may continue to evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions in order to grow our business. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of such transactions that may be material to our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction, or that we will identify appropriate transactions on terms acceptable to us. Adverse capital markets and volatility in our stock price could also negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions. Future acquisitions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance, employee benefit costs, retention costs for executive officers and key employees, asset impairment charges, integration costs, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, unexpected liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees.\nAdditionally, future acquisitions may result in the dilutive issuances of equity securities, use of our cash resources, incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities, amortization expense related to acquired definite-lived intangible assets or the potential impairment of amounts capitalized as intangible assets, including goodwill. Any of these items could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on the successful integration and leveraging of technology, operations, sales and marketing channels and personnel. Integration and other risks associated with acquisitions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are integrated simultaneously. The challenges and risks involved in the integration of our acquired businesses, as well as any future businesses that we may acquire, include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention and resources that would otherwise be available for the current operation of our business;\n\u2022\nfailure to fully achieve expected synergies and costs savings or anticipated benefits may take longer;\n\u2022\nhigher integration costs than anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe impact on employee morale and the retention of employees, many of whom may have specialized knowledge about the business;\n\u2022\nlost revenues or opportunities as a result of our current or potential customers or strategic partners deciding to delay or forego business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties combining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating the sales organizations of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe integration of departments, operating support systems, such as provisioning and billing systems, and technologies, such as network equipment; and\n\u2022\nthe need to implement and maintain uniform controls, procedures and policies throughout all of our acquired companies or the need to remediate significant control deficiencies that may exist at acquired companies\nRisks Related to Our Business Services\nWe face significant competition in our business markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe market for our business customers is highly competitive, and we expect this competition to continue to intensify. Our business markets are rapidly changing due to industry consolidation, an evolving regulatory environment and the emergence of new technologies. Our primary competitors are incumbent local exchange carriers (\u201cILECs\u201d), such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.; competitive local exchange carriers (\u201cCLECs\u201d), such as Global Capacity, Level 3 Communications Inc., Windstream Holdings, Inc. and XO Communications; cable service providers, such as Charter Communications, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Cox Communications, Inc. and Time Warner Cable; wireless service providers; and asset-light network companies. We also compete with various other service providers for our managed network, security and cloud services, including managed hosting and cloud providers, managed security companies, technology companies, hardware manufactures and system integrators. For more information regarding competition, refer to Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe the primary competitive factors in our business markets include price, availability, reliability of service, network security, variety of service offerings, quality of service and reputation of the service provider. While we believe our business services compete favorably based on some of these factors, we are at a competitive disadvantage with respect to certain of our competitors. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater market presence, technical and marketing capabilities and financial, personnel and other resources substantially greater than ours; own larger and more diverse networks; are subject to less regulation; or have substantially stronger brand names. In addition, industry consolidation has resulted in larger competitors that have greater economies of scale. Consequently, these competitors may be better equipped to charge lower prices for their products and services, to provide more attractive offerings, to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, to adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, to increase prices that we pay for wholesale inputs to our services and to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services.\nCompetition could adversely impact us in several ways, including: (i) the loss of customers and resulting revenue; (ii) the possibility of customers reducing their usage of our services or shifting to less profitable services; (iii) reduced traffic on our networks; (iv) the need to expend substantial time or money on new capital improvement projects; and (v) the need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive.\nFailure to retain existing customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are experiencing churn for our business customers, primarily due to competition and changing technology. Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our services after the expiration of their initial commitment, and these service agreements may not be renewed at the same price or level of service, if at all. If our customers do not renew their agreements with us or if they renew on less favorable terms, our revenue could decline and our business may suffer. In addition, we have implemented, and expect to continue to implement, targeted price increases, which could negatively impact customer churn. To offset the impacts of churn, are focused on re-term efforts, retention offers, targeted price increases upselling products and services and focused on adding larger multi-location retail and service businesses, which have a lower churn profile. However, failure to retain existing customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nDecisions by legislative or regulatory authorities, including the Federal Communications Commission, relieving incumbent carriers of certain regulatory requirements, and possible further deregulation in the future, may restrict our ability to provide services and may increase the costs we incur to provide these services.\nWe rely in significant part on purchasing wholesale services, including special access services, interconnection to exchange traffic with incumbent and other carriers, and leasing network facilities from AT&T, CenturyLink, Verizon and other incumbent carriers. Over the past several years, the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) has reduced or eliminated a number of regulations governing the incumbent carriers' offerings, which has had the effect of reducing these carriers' competition-related obligations. These FCC actions include removal of local switching and other network elements from the list of elements that the incumbent carriers must provide on an unbundled basis at TELRIC cost-based rates, the grant of broad pricing flexibility to incumbents for their special access services in many areas, and the nationwide deregulation of certain services including optical carrier transmission and packet-switched services. If the FCC continues to reduce or eliminate regulations governing incumbent carriers, and if the incumbent carriers do not continue to permit us to purchase these services from them under commercial arrangements at reasonable rates, our business could be adversely affected and our cost of providing local service could increase. This can have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe incumbent carriers regularly attempt to further reduce their competition-related obligations to non-incumbent carriers like us. In November 2012, AT&T filed a petition with the FCC requesting that the FCC open a proceeding \u201cto facilitate\u2026 the transition\u201d from technology platforms such as copper loops to IP-based platforms, which proceeding could have the effect of further reducing the local competition-related obligations of the incumbent carriers. The FCC has also established a task force to coordinate its efforts on IP interconnection. Likewise, certain states have taken steps to address IP interconnection. In addition, certain incumbent LECs have expressed an intention to begin discontinuing DS1 and DS3 special access services or at least certain term plans that provide us with discounts on these services. However, in August 2015, the FCC adopted a requirement that for an ILEC to receive authority to discontinue, reduce, or impair a legacy service that is used as a wholesale input by competitive providers, the ILEC must commit to providing competitive carriers \u201creasonably comparable\u201d wholesale access on \u201creasonably comparable\u201d rates, terms, and conditions. This requirement expires upon the resolution of the FCC\u2019s pending review of the special access market. We cannot predict how the FCC will interpret the \u201creasonably comparable\u201d standard or how application of that standard will affect our ability to obtain sufficient wholesale inputs from in the incumbent LECs in the future\nIf the FCC, Congress, state legislatures or state regulatory agencies were to adopt measures reducing the local competition-related obligations of the incumbents or allowing those carriers to increase the rates we must pay, we could experience additional increases in operating costs that would negatively affect our operating results and cash flows. In addition, the FCC currently is considering whether and how to reform its special access rules. We rely to a considerable extent on interstate special access services purchased from the incumbent carriers in order to connect to our customers. If the FCC adopts rules that do not protect our ability to purchase these services at reasonable prices on non-discriminatory terms as compared to our competitors, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to interconnect with AT&T, Verizon and other incumbent carriers on acceptable terms, our ability to offer competitively priced local telephone services will be adversely affected.\nTo provide local telephone services, we must interconnect with and resell the services of the incumbent carriers to supplement our own network facilities, pursuant to interconnection agreements between us and the incumbent carriers. We operate under interconnection agreements with AT&T, CenturyLink, Fairpoint Communications, Frontier Communications, Verizon and Windstream. An interconnection agreement typically has a term of three years, although the parties may mutually agree to extend or amend such agreements. Federal law requires these carriers to negotiate the terms of interconnection agreements with us in good faith, but if such negotiations are unsuccessful we may be forced into an expensive arbitration proceeding before state PUCs, with an uncertain outcome. If we are not able to renegotiate or enter into interconnection agreements on acceptable terms, or if we are subject to unfavorable arbitration decisions, our cost of doing business could increase and our ability to compete could be impeded. Moreover, our interconnection agreements and traffic exchange agreements with companies other than ILECs (such as wireless and VoIP providers and other competitive carriers) are not subject to the statutory arbitration mechanism, making it potentially more difficult to reach any agreement on terms that we view as acceptable. If we are unable to enter into, maintain, or update favorable interconnection agreements in our markets, our ability to provide local services on a competitive and profitable basis may be adversely affected. Any successful effort by the incumbent carriers to deny or substantially limit our access to their network elements or wholesale services (in commercial agreements or by regulatory petition or otherwise) also would harm our ability to provide local telephone services.\nThe continued decline in switched access and reciprocal compensation revenue will adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are experiencing declines in revenues for switched access and reciprocal compensation as a result of lower volume of traditional long distance voice minutes and FCC and state regulations compelling a reduction of switched access and reciprocal compensation rates. In late 2011, the FCC adopted policy changes that over time are reducing carriers' terminating access rates. We have modified our applicable state access tariffs and billing to implement the FCC's required reduction in intrastate access charges. These rules have resulted in a loss of revenues and an increase in our volume of carrier disputes, and we expect this to continue and we are required to reduce our interstate access charges and reciprocal compensation charges in coming years. Moreover, the FCC has pending an open proceeding that asks whether originating switched access charges should also be reduced. Switched access and reciprocal compensation together have been declining over time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compensate for the reduction in intercarrier compensation revenue with other revenue sources or increased volume.\nFailure to obtain and maintain necessary permits and rights-of-way could interfere with our network infrastructure and operations.\nWe must negotiate and manage agreements with state highway authorities, local governments, transit authorities, local telephone companies and other utilities, railroads, long distance carriers and other parties to obtain and maintain rights-of-way and similar franchises and licenses needed to install, operate and maintain fiber optic cable and our other network elements. If any of these authorizations terminate or lapse, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf our larger carrier customers terminate the service they receive from us, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe generate wholesale revenue from the sale of transmission capacity to other telecommunications carriers and have substantial business relationships with several large telecommunications carriers for whom we provide services. Replacing this wholesale revenue may be difficult because individual enterprise and small to medium business customers tend to place smaller service orders than our larger carrier customers. In addition, pricing pressure on services that we sell to our carrier customers may challenge our ability to grow revenue from carrier customers. As a result, if our larger carrier customers terminate the services they receive from us, our wholesale revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe obtain a majority of our network equipment and software from a limited number of third-party suppliers.\nWe obtain the majority of our network equipment and software from a limited number of third-party suppliers. We also rely on these suppliers for technical support and assistance. If any of these relationships is terminated or if the third-party suppliers were to otherwise fail to provide necessary equipment and software, our ability to efficiently maintain, upgrade or expand our network could be impaired. Although we believe that we would be able to address our future equipment needs with equipment obtained from other suppliers, we cannot assure that such equipment would be compatible with our network without significant modifications or cost, if at all. If we were unable to obtain the equipment necessary to maintain our network, our ability to attract and retain customers and provide our services would be impaired.\nRisks Related to Our Consumer Services\nOur commercial and alliance arrangements may not be renewed or may not generate expected benefits, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant number of our new consumer subscribers are generated through our agreements with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. These agreements are not exclusive and have a short term. Our agreement with Time Warner Cable expires in October 2017 and our agreement with Bright House Networks expires in February 2017. There are no assurances we will be able to renew these agreements or our other commercial and alliance arrangements as they expire or otherwise terminate, or that we will receive the same benefits as we do today if the agreements are extended. There is no commitment for Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks or our other partners to provide us with new customers and these partners may market their own services rather than ours. In addition, mergers and consolidation in the industry, including the proposed merger of Charter Communications, Inc., Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, may impact future agreements. Any of the above could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur consumer business is dependent on the availability of third-party network service providers.\nOur consumer business depends on the availability, capacity, affordability, reliability and security of third-party network service providers. Only a small number of providers offer the network services we require, and the majority of our network services are\ncurrently purchased from a limited number of network service providers. Many network service providers have merged and may continue to merge, which would reduce the number of suppliers from which we could purchase network services. Our largest providers of broadband connectivity are AT&T, Bright House Networks, Comcast Corporation, Fairpoint, Frontier, Global Capacity, Time Warner Cable and Verizon. Our principal provider for narrowband services is GlobalPOPs. We also have agreements with various other providers, including certain regional and local dial-up providers.\nWe cannot be certain of renewal or non-termination of our contracts with network service providers or that legislative or regulatory factors will not affect our contracts. Additionally, each of our network service providers sells network access to some of our competitors and could choose to grant those competitors preferential network access or pricing. Many of our network service providers compete with us in the market to provide consumer Internet access. As our consumer business continues to decline, our network service providers may not want to continue their relationship with us or do so at current prices. Our agreements generally have volume based tiered pricing which is leading to higher unit costs as we experience declines in subscribers. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to renew or extend contracts with our current network service providers on acceptable terms, renew or extend current contracts with our network service providers at all, acquire similar network capacity from other network providers, or otherwise maintain or extend our footprint.\nWe face significant competition in the Internet access industry that could reduce our profitability.\nThe Internet access industry is extremely competitive, and we expect competition to continue to intensify. Our primary competitors are national communications companies and local exchange carriers, such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Verizon and Windstream; cable companies providing broadband access, including Charter, Comcast, Cox Communications, Inc. and Time Warner Cable; local and regional ISPs; established online services companies, such as AOL and the Microsoft Network; free or value-priced ISPs, such as United Online, Inc. which provides service under the brands Juno and NetZero; wireless Internet service providers; content companies and email providers, such as Google and Yahoo!; and satellite and fixed wireless service providers. Competitors for our advertising services also include content providers, large web publishers, web search engine and portal companies, Internet advertising providers, content aggregation companies, social-networking web sites, and various other companies that facilitate Internet advertising. The wireless business has expanded significantly and has caused many subscribers with traditional Internet access services to terminate those services and to rely exclusively on wireless services, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets, smartphones and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, also compete with our Internet access services.\nWe believe the primary competitive factors in the Internet access industry are price, speed, features, coverage area and quality of service. While we believe our Internet access services compete favorably based on some of these factors when compared to some Internet access providers, we are at a competitive disadvantage relative to some or all of these factors with respect to other of our competitors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater market presence and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. Our dial-up Internet access services do not compete favorably with broadband services with respect to speed, and dial-up Internet access services no longer have a significant, if any, price advantage over certain broadband services. Most of the largest providers of broadband services, such as cable and telecommunications companies, control their own networks and offer a wider variety of services than we offer, including voice, data and video services. Their ability to bundle services and to offer broadband services at prices below the price that we can profitably offer comparable services puts us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our only significant access to offer broadband services over cable is through our agreement with Time Warner Cable.\nCompetition could adversely impact us in several ways, including: (i) the loss of customers and resulting revenue; (ii) the possibility of customers shifting to less profitable services; (iii) the need to lower prices of our services; (iv) the need to respond to particular short-term, market-specific situations, such as special introductory pricing; and (v) the need to increase marketing expenses or other operating costs to remain competitive. Any of the above could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe continued decline of our consumer access subscribers will adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, our average consumer access subscribers were 1.1 million, 0.9 million to 0.8 million. Our consumer access subscriber base and revenues have been declining due to continued maturation of the market for Internet access, competitive pressures in the industry and limited sales and marketing efforts. We expect our consumer access subscriber base and revenues to continue to decline. We have implemented, and may continue to implement, targeted price increases, which could also negatively impact our churn rates. We are focused on retaining customers and managing our customers for cash. Although we have reduced costs in order to manage the profitability of our consumer services, we will not be able to reduce costs proportional to our revenue declines over time. If we do not maintain our relationships with current customers or acquire new customers, our results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nLack of regulation governing wholesale Internet service providers could adversely affect our operations.\nWe resell broadband Internet access services offered by cable companies and wireline LECs pursuant to wholesale agreements with those providers. In an order released in March 2015, the FCC classified retail broadband Internet access services as telecommunications services subject to regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. That ruling is subject to a pending appeal. The classification of retail broadband Internet access services as telecommunications services means that providers of these services are subject to the general requirement that their charges, practices and classifications for telecommunications services be \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d and that they refrain from engaging in any \u201cunjust or unreasonable discrimination\u201d with respect to their charges, practices or classifications. However, the FCC has not determined what, if any, regulations will apply to wholesale broadband Internet access services and it is uncertain whether it will adopt requirements that are favorable or unfavorable to us. In the absence of favorable regulation applicable to wholesale broadband Internet access services, we may not be able to obtain those services on prices that enable us to compete effectively for retail customers. It is also possible that the classification of retail broadband Internet access services will be overturned on appeal, that Congress will adopt legislation reversing that decision, or that a future FCC will reverse that decision. Any of these outcomes would reduce the likelihood that favorable regulations governing wholesale broadband Internet access services will be adopted in the future. It is too early to predict the outcome of the final FCC regulations and the resulting impact to our results of operations and cash flows, if any.\nGeneral Risks\nCyber security breaches could harm our business.\nWe maintain large repositories of personal and proprietary customer data and are a third-party provider of managed network and cloud services. Cyber security breaches expose us to a risk of unauthorized access to this information. The risk that a security breach could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand our managed network, security and cloud services. We are regularly subject to cyber security attacks and are also subject to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions, although no attack or other disruption has had material consequences to date. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. As a result of the ever-evolving threats, we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. We have been and will continue to be required to use significant capital and other resources to remedy, protect against and alleviate these and related problems, and we may not be able to remedy these problems in a timely manner, or at all. A material security breach could damage our reputation, increase our security costs, expose us to litigation and lead to the loss of existing or potential customers. If our services are perceived as not being secure, our business, including our strategy to serve as a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider, may be adversely affected.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our business could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our services.\nConcerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. We strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies. However, any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws, regulations or policies may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFederal and state governments have adopted consumer protection laws and undertaken enforcement actions to address advertising and user privacy. Our services and business practices, or changes to our services and business practices could subject us to investigation or enforcement actions if we fail to adequately comply with applicable consumer protection laws. Existing and future federal and state laws and regulations also may affect the manner in which we are required to protect confidential customer data and other information, which could increase the cost of our operations and our potential liability if the security of our confidential customer data is breached.\nInterruption or failure of our network, information systems or other technologies could impair our ability to provide our services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide reliable service. Many of our products are supported by our data centers. Our network, data centers, central offices, corporate headquarters and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, capacity limitations, telecommunications failures, software and hardware defects or malfunctions, break ins, sabotage and vandalism, human error and other disruptions that are beyond our control. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our\ndisaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be adequate. We have experienced interruptions in service in the past due to factors such as vulnerabilities in equipment, configuration, design and operating procedures. We also experience interruptions due to cable damage, theft of our equipment, power outages, inclement weather and service failures of our third-party service providers. We may experience service interruptions or system failures in the future. We continue to invest capital to enhance, expand and increase the reliability of our network, but these capital expenditures may not achieve the results we expect. The occurrence of any disruption or system failure or other significant disruption to business continuity may result in a loss of business, increase expenses, damage our reputation for providing reliable service, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to litigation and possible financial losses, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on effective business support systems and processes.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and develop effective business support systems. Business support systems are needed for quoting, accepting and inputting customer orders for services; provisioning, installing and delivering services; providing customers with direct access to our information systems so that they can manage the services that they purchase from us, generally through on-line customer portals; and billing for services. We acquired several companies over the past few years with multiple operating support systems requiring varying degrees of integration. If we are inefficient in our front-end customer impacting systems, it could lead to fewer booked sales and/or higher customer churn. To effectively manage our information technology infrastructure, we will need to continue to maintain our data, billing and other operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, which can be costly. We have experienced system failures from time to time, and any interruption in the availability of our business support systems, in particular our billing systems, could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues. Our ability to maintain, expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to changing needs is important to the continued implementation of our business strategy. In addition, as our consumer business continues to decline, we are more dependent on fewer individuals to maintain our internal consumer business support systems. Our inability to maintain, expand or upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, which could include the delayed implementation of new service offerings, service or billing interruptions and the diversion of development resources.\nIf we, or other industry participants, are unable to successfully defend against disputes or legal actions, we could face substantial liabilities or suffer harm to our financial and operational prospects.\nWe are currently a party to various disputes, litigation or other legal proceedings arising from normal business activities, including regulatory audits, E911 payments, trademark and patent infringement, billing disputes, rights of access, tax, consumer protection, employment and tort. The result of any current or future disputes, litigation or other legal proceedings is inherently unpredictable. Defending against disputes, litigation or other legal proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we may not prevail in these actions. In addition, our ongoing operations may subject us to litigation risks and costs in the future. Both the costs of defending lawsuits and any settlements or judgments against us could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to the risks associated with the resolution of various third-party disputes, lawsuits, arbitrations and proceedings affecting our business services. The deregulation of the telecommunications industry, the implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the evolution of telecommunications infrastructure from time-division multiplexing to Internet Protocol have resulted in the involvement of numerous industry participants in disputes, lawsuits, proceedings and arbitrations before state and federal regulatory commissions, private arbitration organizations such as the American Arbitration Association, and courts over many issues that will be important to our financial and operational success. These issues include the interpretation and enforcement of existing interconnection agreements and tariffs, the terms of new interconnection agreements, operating performance obligations, intercarrier compensation, E911 services, treatment of different categories of traffic (for example, traffic originated or terminated on wireless or VoIP), the jurisdiction of traffic for intercarrier compensation purposes, the wholesale services and facilities available to us, the prices we will pay for those services and facilities and the regulatory treatment of new technologies and services.\nWe may be accused of infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties, which is costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nFrom time to time third parties have alleged that we infringe on their intellectual property rights, including patent rights, and we expect to continue to be subject to such claims. We may be unaware of filed patent applications and of issued patents that could be related to our products and services. These claims are often made by patent holding companies that are not operating companies. The alleging parties generally seek royalty payments for prior use as well as future royalty streams. Defending against disputes, litigation or other legal proceedings, whether or not meritorious, may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we may not prevail in these actions.\nBoth the costs of defending lawsuits and any settlements or judgments against us could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property.\nWe regard our trademarks, including EarthLink, EarthLink Business and EarthLink Carrier, as valuable assets to our business. In particular, we believe the strength of these brands among existing and potential customers is important to the success of our business. Additionally, our EarthLink, EarthLink Business and EarthLink Carrier service marks, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property are also important to the success of our business. We principally rely upon trademark law as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our technology and proprietary rights and information. We require employees and consultants and, when possible, suppliers and distributors to sign confidentiality agreements, and we generally control access to, and distribution of, our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use, our brand image may be harmed and our business may suffer. In addition, protecting our intellectual property and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel, and the loss of any of our key executive officers could adversely affect us.\nOur business depends on our ability to hire and retain key executive officers, senior management, sales, IT and other key personnel, many of whom have significant experience in our industry and whose expertise is required to successfully transition our business into a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider. There is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled personnel. Workforce reductions, changes in our business strategy and acquisitions may affect our ability to retain or replace key personnel, harm employee morale and productivity or disrupt our business. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to uncertainty or a desire not to remain with us following a workforce reduction, change in business strategy or acquisition. Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and transitions involving key employees could hinder execution of our business strategies. Finally, the loss of any of our key executives could impair our ability to execute our business strategy or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could harm our business.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, including recession and disruptions to the credit and financial markets, could negatively affect our business. These conditions could adversely affect the affordability of, and customer demand for, some of our products and services and could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products and services. Many of our existing customers are small and medium-sized businesses, and a significant number of our customers are in the retail industry. We believe these businesses are likely to be affected by economic downturns. Unfavorable general economic conditions could cause business customers to reduce technology spending, which could negatively impact sales of our growth services. In addition, our business customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us. One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenues to decline, churn to increase, allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable to increase or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could also negatively impact third-party vendors we rely on for services and network equipment integral to our business. If these vendors encounter financial difficulties, their ability to supply services and network equipment to us may be curtailed. If such vendors were to fail, we may not be able to replace them without disruption to, or deterioration of, our service and we may incur higher costs associated with new vendors. If we were required to purchase another manufacturer's equipment, we could incur significant initial costs to integrate the equipment into our network and to train personnel to use the new equipment. Any interruption in the services provided by our third-party vendors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernment regulations could adversely affect our business or force us to change our business practices.\nOur services are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation. Federal, state and local regulations governing our services are the subject of ongoing judicial proceedings, rulemakings and legislative initiatives that could change the manner in which our industry operates and affect our business. Changes in regulations or in governing legislation, such as the Telecommunications Act of 1996, could have a significant effect on our business, particularly if the change impairs our ability to interconnect with incumbent carrier networks, lease portions of other carriers' networks or resell their services at reasonable prices, or lease elements of networks of the ILECs under acceptable rates, terms and conditions. We cannot predict the outcome of any\nongoing legislative initiatives or administrative or judicial proceedings or their potential impact upon the communications and information technology industries generally or upon us specifically.\nFailure to make proper payments for federal USF assessments, FCC regulatory fees, E911 charges or other amounts mandated by federal, state and local regulations; failure to maintain proper state tariffs and certifications; failure to comply with federal, state or local laws and regulations; failure to obtain and maintain required licenses, franchises and permits; imposition of burdensome license, franchise or permit requirements for us to operate in public rights-of-way; and imposition of new burdensome or adverse regulatory requirements could limit the types of services we provide or the terms on which we provide these services.\nWe are subject to regulatory audits in the ordinary course of business with respect to various matters, including audits by local municipalities for E911 charges and audits by the Universal Service Administrative Company on USF assessments and payments. These audits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of liabilities, interest and penalties if our positions are not accepted by the auditing entity. Our financial statements contain reserves for certain of such potential liabilities which we consider reasonable. Calculation of payments due with respect to these matters can be complex and subject to differences in interpretation. As a result, these audits could result in liabilities in excess of such reserves which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business also is subject to a variety of other U.S. laws and regulations from various entities, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as by state and local regulatory agencies, that could subject us to liabilities, claims or other remedies. Compliance with these laws and regulations is complex and may require significant costs. In addition, the regulatory framework relating to Internet and communications services is evolving and both the federal government and states from time to time pass legislation that impacts our business. It is likely that additional laws and regulations will be adopted that would affect our business. We cannot predict the impact future laws, regulatory changes or developments may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The enactment of any additional laws or regulations, increased enforcement activity of existing laws and regulations, or claims by individuals could significantly impact our costs or the manner in which we conduct business, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cause our business to suffer.\nOur business may suffer if third parties are unable to provide services or terminate their relationships with us.\nOur business and financial results depend, in part, on the availability and quality of certain third-party service providers. Specifically, we rely on third parties for customer service and technical support, web hosting services, certain billing and collection services and E911 service for our VoIP services and our Consumer Services segment relies primarily on one customer service and technical support vendor. We may have to increase the price we pay or find a new supplier, which could impact our customers' experience and increase churn. We are not currently equipped to provide the necessary range of service and support functions in the event that any of our service providers become unable or unwilling to offer these services to us. Our outsourced customer support providers utilize international locations to provide us with customer service and technical support services, and as a result, our customer support providers may become subject to financial, economic, environmental and political risks beyond our or the providers' control, which could jeopardize their ability to deliver customer service and technical support services. In addition, our VoIP services, including our E911 service, depend on the proper functioning of facilities and equipment owned and operated by third parties and is, therefore, beyond our control. If one or more of our service providers does not provide us with quality services, or if our relationship with any of our third party vendors terminates and we are unable to provide those services internally or identify a replacement vendor in an orderly, cost-effective and timely manner, our business, results of operations and cash flows could suffer.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $137.8 million of goodwill and $25.3 million of other intangible assets. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not indicate that goodwill or any such assets might be impaired. We evaluate the recoverability of our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, higher customer churn and slower growth rates in our industry. Deterioration in estimated future cash flows in our reporting units could result in future goodwill impairment. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015 we disaggregated our legacy Business Services reporting unit into three separate reporting units, which could increase the risk of future goodwill impairment because of the increased level of detail in the analysis. As we continue to assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our goodwill and other intangible assets, changes to\nour business strategy, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance or other indicators of impairment could cause us to record a significant impairment charge during the period in which the impairment is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities and we may be limited in the use of our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $681.0 million of gross tax net operating losses for federal income tax purposes and approximately $32.6 million of net tax net operating losses for state income tax purposes, which includes federal and state net operating losses acquired in connection with our acquisitions. The tax net operating losses for federal income tax purposes begin to expire in 2020 and the tax net operating losses for state income tax purposes began to expire in 2015.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nAn \u201cownership change\u201d that occurs during a \u201ctesting period\u201d (as such terms are defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) could place significant limitations, on an annual basis, on the use of such net operating losses to offset future taxable income we may generate. In general, future stock transactions and the timing of such transactions could cause an \u201cownership change\u201d for income tax purposes. Such transactions may include our purchases under our share repurchase program, additional issuances of common stock by us and acquisitions or sales of shares by certain holders of our shares, including persons who have held, currently hold, or may accumulate in the future five percent or more of our outstanding stock. Many of these transactions are beyond our control. Calculations of an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 are complex and to some extent are dependent on information that is not publicly available. The risk of an \u201cownership change\u201d occurring could increase if additional shares are repurchased, if additional persons acquire five percent or more of our outstanding common stock in the near future and/or current five percent stockholders increase their interest. Due to this risk, we monitor our purchases of additional shares of our common stock. Since an \u201cownership change\u201d also could result from a change in control of our company, with subsequent annual limitations on the use of our net operating losses, this could discourage a change in control.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Financial Resources\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and limit our ability to react to changes in our business and industry.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $508.9 million gross amount of debt outstanding, which consisted of $300.0 million outstanding principal amount of 7.375% senior secured notes due 2020 (the \u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d), $173.9 million outstanding principal amount of 8.875% senior notes due 2019 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and $35.0 million outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial indebtedness will require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make debt service payments and may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flows from operations for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to engage in strategic transactions or to make divestitures of non-strategic businesses;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability in the future to generate cash flows from operations, which is subject to all the risks of our business. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations for us to repay our indebtedness when such indebtedness becomes due and to meet our other cash needs. Although we reduced our gross amount of outstanding debt by $91.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, we may not be able to continue to reduce the gross amount of our outstanding debt in the future.\nWe may require substantial capital to support business growth, and this capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe incurred capital expenditures of $87.5 million in 2015, and we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $85.0 million to $105.0 million in 2016. We may require additional capital to support our business growth, including the need to develop new services and products, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. We may also require substantial capital to maintain, upgrade and enhance our network facilities and operations. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds.\nWe may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, at the time we desire to obtain such funding. If we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed, we may not be able to pursue our growth strategy, and our business could suffer. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. In addition, any debt financing that we may obtain in the future could have restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.\nOur debt agreements include restrictive covenants, and failure to comply with these covenants could trigger acceleration of payment of outstanding indebtedness.\nThe agreements that govern our Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes and senior secured revolving credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. If we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements, which may require us to repay some or all of our indebtedness. These restrictions limit or restrict, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022\npurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or use assets as security;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting such restricted subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, make loans or transfer assets to us or other restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our or their assets.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe may reduce, or cease payment of, quarterly cash dividends.\nThe payment of future quarterly dividends is discretionary and is subject to determination by our Board of Directors each quarter following its review of our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Changes in our business needs, including funding for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt servicing and working capital, or a change in tax laws relating to dividends, among other factors, could cause our Board of Directors to decide to reduce, or cease the payment of, dividends in the future. In addition, the agreements governing our Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes and senior secured revolving credit facility contain restrictions on the amount of dividends we can pay. There can be no assurance that we will not decrease or discontinue quarterly cash dividends, and if we do, our stock price could be negatively impacted.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to fluctuations in response to certain events and factors, such as quarterly variations in results of operations; entry into business combinations or other major transactions; changes in our business strategy; changes in financial estimates; changes in recommendations or reduced coverage by securities analysts; the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; news reports relating to trends in the markets in which we operate; market trends unrelated to our performance; and general economic conditions. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. Finally, volatility or a lack of positive performance\nin our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom have been granted stock incentive awards.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other elements of our capital structure could limit our share price and delay a change of control of the company.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent Board of Directors. These provisions, among other things, limit the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders and authorize the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series without any action on the part of stockholders. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and significantly impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change control of the company. These provisions that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 flexibility in obtaining a judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors or officers or other employee or agent of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In the event that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over any action or proceeding described above, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding will be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees or agents. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 83291, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ELNK"}
