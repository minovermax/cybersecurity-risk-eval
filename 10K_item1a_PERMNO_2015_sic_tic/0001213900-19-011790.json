{"cik": "1681941", "company": "iFresh Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-06-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Common Stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, before deciding to invest in our Common Stock. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business, prospects, sales, revenues, gross profit, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\nWe are currently in default under our Credit Facility with Key Bank, which limits our liquidity and could result in Key Bank accelerating amounts we owe to it under the facility.\nOn December 23, 2016, NYM, as borrower, entered into a $25 million senior secured Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Key Bank National Association (\u201cKey Bank\u201d or \u201cLender\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for (1) a revolving credit of $5,000,000 for making advance and issuance of letter of credit, (2) $15,000,000 of effective date term loan and (3) $5,000,000 of delayed draw term loan. The interest rate is equal to (1) the Lender\u2019s \u201cprime rate\u201d plus 0.95%, or (b) the Adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.95%. As reflected in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the Company had operating losses in fiscal year 2019 and had negative working capital of $21.7 million and $18.4 million as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had negative equity of $1.0 million as of March 31, 2019. The Company did not meet the financial covenant required in the credit agreement with Keybank. As of March 31, 2019, the Company has outstanding loan facilities of approximately $21.3 million due to Keybank. Failure to maintain these loan facilities will have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nIn assessing its liquidity, management monitors and analyzes the Company\u2019s cash on-hand, its ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. iFresh had funded working capital and other capital requirements in the past primarily by equity contribution from shareholders, cash flow from operations, and bank loans. As of March 31, 2019, the Company also has $5.9 million of advances and receivable from the related parties we intend to collect. On June 7, 2019, the Company entered into certain Share Exchange Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement to spin off its Asia supermarket business and switch to internet lending business primarily located in China through the acquisition (refer to Note 19). The acquisition is expected to improve the Company\u2019s liquidity and cash flow\nAlthough the Company has been timely repaying the KeyBank facility in accordance with its terms, the Company was in default under the Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2019 and 2018. Specifically, the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain a senior funded debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) ratio for the trailing 12 month period of less than 3.00 to 1.00 at the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, this ratio was greater than 3.00 to 1.00 and the Company was therefore not in compliance with the financial covenants of the KeyBank loan. In addition, the Company violated the loan covenant when Mr. Long Deng, CEO and major shareholder of the Company sold an aggregate of 8,294,989 restricted shares to HK Xu Ding Co., Limited, representing 51% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company as of December 31, 2018. The Company failed to obtain a written consent for the occurrence of the change of ownership. KeyBank has notified the Company that it has not waived the default and reserves all of its rights, power, privileges, and remedies under the Credit Agreement. effective as of March 1, 2019, interest was accrued on all loans at the default rate.\nThe Company\u2019s principal liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. The Company\u2019s ability to fund these needs will depend on its future performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, competitive and other factors beyond its control. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company\u2019s ability to remain a going concern.\nThere is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we incurred operating losses, did not meet the financial covenant required in the Credit Agreement and are currently in default of the Credit Agreement due to our failure to pay certain tax obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\niFresh\u2019s continued growth depends on new store acquisitions and openings and on increasing same store sales, and iFresh\u2019s failure to achieve these goals could negatively impact its results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends, in large part, on acquiring and opening new stores in existing and new areas and operating those stores successfully. Successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on sufficient capital support from financing, finding suitable stores to acquire, identifying suitable locations and negotiating acceptable lease terms for store sites, as it faces competition from other retailers for such sites. There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through new store acquisitions and openings. We may not be able to obtain sufficient capital support for the expansion plan, or successfully implement the plan to acquire or open new stores timely or within budget or operate them successfully, and there can be no assurance that store acquisition or opening costs for, net sales of, contribution margin of and average payback period on initial investment for new stores will conform to our operating model discussed elsewhere in this report. Lower contribution margins from new stores, along with the impact of related store acquisition, opening and store management relocation costs, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we acquire stores in the future, it may not be able to successfully integrate those stores into its existing store base and those stores may not be as profitable as its existing stores.\nAlso, we may not be able to successfully hire, train and retain new store employees or integrate those employees into the programs, policies and culture of us. We or our third party vendors may not be able to adapt our distribution, management and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner. We may not have the level of cash flow or financing necessary to support our growth strategy.\nAdditionally, our acquisition and opening of new stores will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause the Company to operate its existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our existing stores. If the Company experiences a decline in performance, it may slow or discontinue store openings, or may decide to close stores that it is unable to operate in a profitable manner.\nAdditionally, some of our new stores may be located in areas where the Company has little experience or a lack of brand recognition. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause these new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets.\nOur operating results and stock price will be adversely affected if we fail to implement our growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful.\nOur newly opened stores may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term and may not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base on a timely basis or at all.\nThe Company has actively pursued new store growth and plans to continue doing so in the future. The Company cannot assure you that its new store acquisitions or openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability. New store openings may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term due to the effect of store opening costs and lower sales and contribution margin during the initial period following opening. New stores build their sales volume and their customer base over time and, as a result, generally have lower margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, than our more mature stores. A new store can take more than a year to achieve a level of operating performance comparable to our similarly existing stores. Further, we have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, some sales volume transfer from our existing stores to our new stores as some of our existing customers switch to new, closer locations. As a result, part of the increase of the overall sales to us arising from a new store opening or a store acquisition may be offset by the \u201csales volume transfer\u201d phenomena.\nThe competition from competitors may increase intensively in the future.\nFood retail is a large and highly competitive industry. However, iFresh believes that the market participants in the Chinese supermarket industry are highly fragmented and immature. Currently, iFresh faces competition from smaller or dispersed competitors focusing on the niche market of Chinese consumers. However, with the rapid growth of the Chinese and other Asian population and their consumption power, other competitors may also begin operating in this niche market in the future. Those competitors include: (i) national conventional supermarkets, (ii) regional supermarkets, (iii) national superstores, (iv) alternative food retailers, (v) local foods stores, (vi) small specialty stores, and (vii) farmers\u2019 markets.\nThe national and regional supermarket chains are experienced in operating multiple stores locations, expanding management and they have greater marketing or financial resources than iFresh does. Even though they currently offer only a limited selection of Chinese and Asian specialty foods, they may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products if they choose to do so. On the contrary, the local food stores and markets are small in size with a deep understanding of local preferences, but their lack of scale results in high risk and limited growth potential.\nIf more and more competitors devote into this market segment aiming to serve Chinese and other Asian customers in the future, the competition will increase. Our operating results may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, reduction in margin from competitive price changes and/or greater operating costs such as marketing, due to the increase of competition.\niFresh relies on a combination of product offerings, customer service, store format, location and pricing to compete.\niFresh competes with other food retailers on a combination of factors, primarily product selection and quality, customer service, store layout and decoration, location and price. Our success depends on its ability to offer products that appeal to its customers\u2019 preferences. Failure to offer such products, or to accurately forecast changing customer preferences, could lead to a decrease in the number of customer transactions at our stores and in the amount customers spend at our stores.\nPricing in particular is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and iFresh expects competitors to continue to apply pricing and other competitive pressures. To the extent that our competitors lower prices, its ability to maintain gross profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted. Some of Our competitors may have greater resources than it does. These competitors could use these advantages to take measures, including reducing prices, which could adversely affect our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf iFresh does not succeed in offering attractively priced products that consumers intend to purchase or are unable to provide a convenient and appealing shopping experience, Our sales, operating margins and market share may decrease, resulting in reduced profitability.\nEconomic conditions that impact consumer spending could materially affect our business.\nOngoing economic uncertainty continues to negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. iFresh\u2019s operating results may be materially affected by changes in economic conditions nationwide or in the regions in which iFresh operates that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. This risk may be exacerbated if customers choose lower-cost alternatives to iFresh\u2019s product offerings in response to economic conditions. In particular, a decrease in discretionary spending could adversely impact sales of certain of iFresh\u2019s higher margin product offerings. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates and fuel and energy costs, could reduce overall consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors. In addition, inflation or deflation can impact iFresh\u2019s business. Food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins. As a result, iFresh\u2019s results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFresh\u2019s existing stores are mainly located in Northeastern American metropolitan areas. The geographic concentration of its stores creates an exposure to the economy of the Northeastern United States and any downturn in this region could materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPerishable products make up a significant portion of iFresh\u2019s sales, and ordering errors or product supply disruptions may have an adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s profitability and operating results.\niFresh has a significant focus on perishable products. Sales of perishable products accounted for approximately 65.2% of iFresh\u2019s net sales in fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. iFresh has self-owned wholesale facilities and stable supply relationship with farm partners, which significantly reduces ordering errors and product disruption. However, iFresh still relies on various suppliers and vendors to provide and deliver its product inventory on a continuous basis. iFresh could suffer significant perishable product inventory losses in the event of the loss of a major supplier or vendor, disruption of its supply chain, extended power outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences. While iFresh has implemented certain systems to ensure that its ordering is in line with demand, it cannot assure you that its ordering systems will always work efficiently, in particular in connection with the new additional stores, which have no, or a limited, ordering history. If iFresh were to over-order, it could suffer inventory losses, which would negatively impact its operating results.\nInterruption of exclusive distribution of brands or imports relating to iFresh\u2019s wholesale operations may adversely impact iFresh\u2019s financial conditions and operating results.\niFresh conducts wholesale business through its two subsidiaries, Strong America and NYMG, which enables iFresh to have stronger negotiating power with vendors as well as a way to source products from China, Thailand and Taiwan to its own retail stores. Strong America is also the exclusive distributor of seven famous oversea brands. If iFresh can\u2019t renew its exclusive distribution contracts relating to those brands, iFresh\u2019s sales, both retail and wholesale, may be adversely affected. Furthermore, importing products from other countries is subject to the impact of various international factors, including international trading policies, shipping costs, currency fluctuations, tariffs and customs procedures for imports, which may affect the supply and purchase prices of the products to be imported by iFresh\u2019s wholesale distributors and sold by them to iFresh. If iFresh fails to obtain or maintain a sustainable supply of these products from its vendors, its financial conditions and operating results will be adversely impacted.\nThe operation of new stores and online sales may cannibalize sales in iFresh\u2019s stores and its financial results can be affected by economic and competitive conditions in this area.\nAll of iFresh\u2019s existing stores are located in the Northeastern United States and it intends to grow its store base in this area. New stores are expected to be opened in the Greater New York City and Boston metropolitan areas. As iFresh opens new stores in closer proximity to its customers who currently travel longer distances to shop at iFresh\u2019s stores, iFresh expects some of these customers to take advantage of the convenience of iFresh\u2019s new locations. Simultaneously, iFresh will develop online sales to cover the customers living in a 2.5-hour drive radius, which may satisfy the demand from those Chinese customers living in the suburbs.\nSome sales volume may transfer from iFresh\u2019s existing stores to its new stores as some of its existing customers switch to these new, closer locations, or convenient online shopping. Consequently, iFresh\u2019s new stores and online sales may adversely impact sales at iFresh\u2019s existing stores.\nDisruption of relationships with vendors could negatively affect iFresh\u2019s business.\niFresh purchases vegetables and fruits directly from farms and other vendors and maintains stable relationships with the vendors to ensure reliable supplies of popular seasonal Chinese specialty of vegetables and fruits. iFresh also depends on third-party suppliers for exclusive third-party brands. The cancellation of iFresh\u2019s supply arrangement with any of its suppliers or the disruption, delay or inability in supply from its suppliers could adversely affect iFresh\u2019s sales. If iFresh\u2019s suppliers fail to comply with food safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted. iFresh cannot assure you that it would be able to find replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms.\niFresh may be unable to protect or maintain its intellectual property, which could result in customer confusion, a negative perception of its brand and adversely affect its business.\niFresh believes that its intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of iFresh\u2019s business. In particular, iFresh\u2019s trademarks, including New York Mart, are valuable assets that reinforce iFresh\u2019s customers\u2019 favorable perception of its stores.\nFrom time to time, third parties have used names similar to iFresh\u2019s, have applied to register trademarks similar to iFresh\u2019s and, as iFresh believes, have infringed or misappropriated iFresh\u2019s intellectual property rights. iFresh responds to these actions on a case-by-case basis, including, where appropriate, by sending cease and desist letters and commencing opposition actions and litigation. The outcomes of these actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements as well as litigation. iFresh cannot assure you that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property rights are adequate, that its intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, iFresh\u2019s trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect iFresh\u2019s trademark rights could prevent iFresh in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to iFresh\u2019s trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers\u2019 perception of iFresh\u2019s brand and products, and eventually adversely affect iFresh\u2019s sales and profitability. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether iFresh is successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject iFresh to liabilities, force iFresh to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force iFresh to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf iFresh experiences a data security breach and confidential customer information is disclosed, iFresh may be subject to penalties and experience negative publicity, which could affect iFresh\u2019s customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its business.\niFresh and its customers could suffer harm if customer information was accessed by third parties due to a security failure in iFresh\u2019s systems. The collection of data and processing of transactions requires iFresh to receive, transmit and store a large amount of personally identifiable and transaction related data. This type of data is subject to legislation and regulation in various jurisdictions. Recently, data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting state and federal legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security. If some of the current proposals are adopted, iFresh may be subject to more extensive requirements to protect the customer information that it processes in connection with the purchases of iFresh\u2019s products. iFresh may become exposed to potential liability with respect to the data that it collects, manages and processes, and may incur legal costs if its information security policies and procedures are not effective or if it is required to defend its methods of collection, processing and storage of personal data. Future investigations, lawsuits or adverse publicity relating to iFresh\u2019s methods of handling personal data could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such developments. Additionally, if iFresh suffers data breaches, one or more of the credit card processing companies that it relies on may refuse to allow it to continue to participate in their network, which would limit iFresh\u2019s ability to accept credit cards at its stores and could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nData theft, information espionage or other criminal activity directed at the retail industry or computer or communications systems may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business by causing iFresh to implement costly security measures in recognition of actual or potential threats, by requiring iFresh to expend significant time and expense developing, maintaining or upgrading its information technology systems and by causing it to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages. Such activities may also materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by reducing consumer confidence in the marketplace and by modifying consumer spending habits.\nIf iFresh is unable to renew or replace current store leases or if it is unable to enter into leases for additional stores on favorable terms, or if one or more of its current leases are terminated prior to expiration of their stated term, and it cannot find suitable alternate locations, iFresh\u2019s growth and profitability could be negatively impacted.\niFresh currently leases all of its store locations. Many of iFresh\u2019s current leases provide unilateral option to renew for several additional rental periods at specific rental rates. iFresh\u2019s ability to re-negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location, and iFresh\u2019s ability to negotiate favorable lease terms for additional store locations, could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties, its relationships with current and prospective landlords, or other factors that are not within iFresh\u2019s control. Any or all of these factors and conditions could negatively impact iFresh\u2019s growth and profitability.\niFresh leases certain of its stores and related properties from related parties.\nLong Deng, one of iFresh\u2019s directors and executive officers, owns 50% of Dragon Development LLC, which leases to iFresh the premises at which Strong America, one of iFresh\u2019s wholesale subsidiaries, is located. During fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, rental payments (excluding maintenance and taxes that iFresh is obligated to pay) under the leases from Dragon Development LLC were $1,359,821. The leases with Dragon Development LLC renewed on May 1, 2016, and their remaining terms are 10 years. iFresh has no assurance that these related parties will renew the lease agreements with it after expiration. If iFresh cannot renew the leases, it will have to move its stores and warehouses locations, which increases the uncertainty of finding suitable locations for those stores and the reputation recognition in new locations, which may adversely affect iFresh\u2019s sales, expenses, profit and financial position.\nFailure to retain iFresh\u2019s senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect its operations.\niFresh\u2019s success is substantially dependent on the continued service of its senior management and other key personnel. These executives, and in particular Long Deng, iFresh\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of iFresh\u2019s business and for executing its growth strategy and are integral to its brand and culture, and the reputation iFresh enjoys with suppliers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s business and prospects, as iFresh may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause iFresh\u2019s stock price to decline. The loss of key employees could negatively affect iFresh\u2019s business.\nIf iFresh is unable to attract, train and retain employees, it may not be able to grow or successfully operate its business.\nThe retail store industry is labor intensive, and iFresh\u2019s success depends in part upon its ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate iFresh\u2019s culture and are able to represent its brand effectively and establish credibility with its business partners and consumers. iFresh\u2019s ability to meet its labor needs, while controlling wage and labor-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the workforce in the markets in which iFresh is located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. In the event of increasing wage rates, if iFresh fails to increase its wages competitively, the quality of its workforce could decline, causing its customer service to suffer, while increasing its wages could cause its earnings to decrease. If iFresh is unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting its business needs and expectations, its business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet iFresh\u2019s staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of iFresh\u2019s employees may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in and enforcement of immigration laws could increase iFresh\u2019s costs and adversely affect iFresh\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified store-level employees.\nFederal and state governments from time to time implement immigration laws, regulations or programs that regulate iFresh\u2019s ability to attract or retain qualified foreign employees. Some of these changes may increase iFresh\u2019s obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject iFresh to additional costs and make iFresh\u2019s hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although iFresh has implemented, and is in the process of enhancing, procedures to ensure its compliance with the employment eligibility verification requirements, there can be no assurance that these procedures are adequate and some of its employees may, without iFresh\u2019s knowledge, be unauthorized workers. The employment of unauthorized workers may subject iFresh to fines or civil or criminal penalties, and if any of iFresh\u2019s workers are found to be unauthorized, iFresh could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts its brand and makes it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. iFresh may be required to terminate the employment of certain of its employees who were determined to be unauthorized workers. The termination of a significant number of employees may disrupt iFresh\u2019s operations, cause temporary increases in iFresh\u2019s labor costs as it trains new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. iFresh\u2019s financial performance could be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.\nProlonged labor disputes with employees and increases in labor costs could adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business.\nA considerable amount of iFresh\u2019s operating costs is attributable to labor costs and, therefore, its financial performance is greatly influenced by increases in wage and benefit costs, including pension and health care costs. As a result, iFresh is exposed to risks associated with a competitive labor market. Rising health care and pension costs and the nature and structure of work rules will be important issues. Any work stoppages or labor disturbances as a result of employees\u2019 dissatisfaction of their current employment terms could have a material adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. iFresh also expects that in the event of a work stoppage or labor disturbance, it could incur additional costs and face increased competition.\nVarious aspects of iFresh\u2019s business are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. iFresh\u2019s compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could materially adversely affect its ability to conduct its business as planned.\niFresh is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, environmental protection, workplace safety, food safety, public health, community right-to-know and alcoholic beverage and tobacco sales. In particular, the states in which iFresh operates and several local jurisdictions regulate the licensing of supermarkets and the sale of alcoholic beverages. In addition, certain local regulations may limit iFresh\u2019s ability to sell alcoholic beverages at certain times. iFresh is also subject to laws governing its relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, immigration, disabled access and work permit requirements. Compliance with new laws in these areas, or with new or stricter interpretations of existing requirements, could reduce the revenue and profitability of iFresh\u2019s stores and could otherwise materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. iFresh\u2019s new store openings could be delayed or prevented or its existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in iFresh\u2019s ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. iFresh\u2019s stores are subject to unscheduled inspections on a regular basis, which, if violations are found, could result in the assessment of fines, suspension of one or more needed licenses and, in the case of repeated \u201ccritical\u201d violations, closure of the store until a re-inspection demonstrates that iFresh has remediated the problem. Certain of iFresh\u2019s parking lots and warehouses either have only temporary certificates of occupancy or are awaiting a certificate of occupancy which, if not granted, would require iFresh to stop using such property. Additionally, a number of federal, state and local laws impose requirements or restrictions on business owners with respect to access by disabled persons. iFresh\u2019s compliance with these laws may result in modifications to iFresh\u2019s properties, or prevent iFresh from performing certain further renovations. iFresh cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on iFresh\u2019s business in the future.\niFresh\u2019s plans to acquire and open new stores requires iFresh to spend capital. Failure to use its capital efficiently could have an adverse effect on iFresh\u2019s profitability.\niFresh\u2019s growth strategy depends on its acquisition of and opening new stores, which will require iFresh to use cash generated by its operations and a portion of the net proceeds of future equity or debt financing and borrowing under bank credit line. iFresh cannot assure you that cash generated by its operations, the net proceeds of future equity or debt financing and borrowing under bank credit line will be sufficient to allow iFresh to implement its growth strategy. If any of these initiatives prove to be unsuccessful, iFresh may experience reduced profitability and it could be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned store openings, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and future operating performance and the price of its common stock.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs on various goods and a potential resulting trade war with China and other countries, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nSome of our merchandise is produced in foreign countries, primarily in China, making the price and availability of our merchandise susceptible to international trade risks and other international conditions. The imposition of tariffs, duties, border adjustment taxes or other trade restrictions by the United States could also result in the adoption of new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions by other countries. Recently, the current U.S. administration and China have imposed significant tariffs on goods imported from the other's country, and more recently, the United States has proposed the imposition of additional tariffs on various goods. If the current administration follows through with such tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States or other countries, the resulting trade barriers could have a significant adverse impact on the cost of our goods, the prices at which we offer them for sale and our overall financial performance. We are not able to predict future trade policy of the United States, China, or of any foreign countries in which we operate or purchase goods, or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements, or their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions and tariffs, quotas and embargoes, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies, has the potential to adversely impact the cost of and demand for our products, our overall costs, our customers, our suppliers and the world economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational results, financial position and cash flows.\nLitigation may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\niFresh\u2019s operations are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide variety of product selections. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, iFresh may be a party to individual personal injury, product liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of its business, including litigation arising from food-related illness. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in iFresh\u2019s businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether iFresh is ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased commodity prices and availability may impact profitability.\nMany of iFresh\u2019s products include ingredients such as wheat, corn, oils, milk, sugar, cocoa and other commodities. Commodity prices worldwide have been increasing. While commodity price inputs do not typically represent the substantial majority of iFresh\u2019s product costs, any increase in commodity prices may cause its vendors to seek price increases from iFresh. Although iFresh is typically able to mitigate vendor efforts to increase its costs, it may be unable to continue to do so, either in whole or in part. In the event iFresh is unable to continue mitigating potential vendor price increases, it may in turn consider raising its prices, and its customers may be deterred by any such price increases. iFresh\u2019s profitability may be impacted through increased costs to it which may impact gross margins, or through reduced revenue as a result of a decline in the number and average size of customer transactions.\nSevere weather, natural disasters and adverse climate changes may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather conditions and other natural disasters in areas where iFresh has stores or from which iFresh obtains the products it sells may materially adversely affect its retail operations or its product offerings and, therefore, its results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to, or temporary or permanent closure of, one or more of iFresh\u2019s stores, an insufficient workforce in iFresh\u2019s markets and/or temporary disruption in the supply of products, including delays in the delivery of goods to iFresh\u2019s stores or a reduction in the availability of products in its stores. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops may materially adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within its supply chain. Any of these factors may disrupt iFresh\u2019s businesses and materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe occurrence of a widespread health epidemic may materially adversely affect iFresh\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\niFresh\u2019s business may be severely impacted by wartime activities, threats or acts of terror or a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic, such as pandemic flu. Such activities, threats or epidemics may materially adversely impact iFresh\u2019s business by disrupting production and delivery of products to iFresh\u2019s stores, by affecting iFresh\u2019s ability to appropriately staff its stores or by causing customers to avoid public gathering places or otherwise change their shopping behaviors.\niFresh needs approximately $50 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 in order to achieve its planned growth for that year and if it cannot successfully obtain sufficient capital, the financial results and stock price of iFresh after the business combination will be adversely affected.\niFresh believes that it needs approximately $50 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 mainly for the purpose of acquiring additional stores to achieve its planned growth for that year. If it is not able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms in connection with the Business Combination, as is contemplated by the parties, it may not be able to implement its growth plan. If it is unable to affect its growth plan, iFresh\u2019s financial results will be significantly worse than anticipated and its stock price may decline as a result.\niFresh is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make its securities less attractive to investors.\niFresh is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. It may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. However, if its non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or the market value of its common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, iFresh would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, iFresh is not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, has reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and is exempt from the requirements of holding a non binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, iFresh has elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, iFresh\u2019s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. As a result, potential investors may be less likely to invest in our securities.\nOur Chief Financial Officer may be subject to conflicts of interest.\nOur Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Long Yi, provides his services on a non-exclusive, part-time basis, and may therefore become subject to conflicts of interest resulting from his other activities. Because Mr. Yi works only part-time, instances may occur where he may not be immediately available to provide solutions to problems or address concerns that arise in the course of us conducting our business and thus adversely affect our business. In addition, Mr. Yi can become subject to conflicts of interest because he devotes part of his working time to other business endeavors, including serving as chief executive officer of Urban Tea Inc. (NASDAQ: MYT) and have responsibilities to these other entities. Such conflicts include deciding how much time to devote to our affairs, as well as what business opportunities should be presented to us. Because of these relationships, Mr. Yi could be subject to conflicts of interest.\nThe directors and officers of our company, including Mr. Yi, are aware of the existence of laws governing the accountability of directors and officers for corporate opportunity and requiring disclosures by the directors and officers of conflicts of interest, and we will rely upon such laws in respect of any conflicts of interest or in respect of any breaches of duty by any of our directors and officers. All such conflicts are to be disclosed by such directors or officers in accordance with applicable laws and the directors and officers are to govern themselves in respect thereof to the best of their ability in accordance with the obligations imposed upon them by law. Currently, we have no policy in place to address such conflicts of interest. In the event Mr. Yi fails to comply with these laws, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with the requirements in the Forbearance Agreement. If KeyBank elects to exercise its rights and remedies under the Forbearance Agreement with respect to any event of default, then it will have a material adverse effect on us and create substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn May 20, 2019 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), the Company, NYM, certain subsidiaries of NYM, Mr. Long Deng and KeyBank National Association entered into a forbearance agreement (the \u201cForbearance Agreement\u201d) with respect to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2016, as amended, pursuant to which KeyBank National Association, \u201cKeyBank\u201d the or \u201cLender\u201d, made available to NYM, the \u201cBorrower\u201d, a revolving credit facility, a term loan facility, and other credit accommodations. Pursuant to that certain Guaranty Agreement, dated as of December 26, 2016, as amended by several joinder agreements, the Company, certain subsidiaries of NYM and Mr. Long Deng (collectively, the \u201cGuarantors\u201d, and together with the Borrower, the \u201cLoan Parties\u201d) have agreed to guarantee the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement (\u201cObligations\u201d). Terms used but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Forbearance Agreement.\nUnder the Forbearance Agreement, the Lender has agreed to delay the exercise of its rights and remedies under the Loan Agreement based on the existence of certain events of default (the \u201cSpecified Events of Default\u201d) until the earlier to occur of (the \u201cTermination Date\u201d): (a) 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 18, 2019; and (b) a Forbearance Event of Default.\nUnder the Forbearance Agreement, the Loan Parties shall, and shall cause the Chief Restructuring Officer to, immediately and diligently pursue, and use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate, a refinance, sale, and/or capital contribution transaction(s) on such terms and conditions, and with proceeds in sufficient amount(s), that will enable the repayment in full of the outstanding Obligations in immediately available funds (a \u201cRepayment Transaction\u201d). On or prior to the 89th day following the Effective Date, the Loan Parties shall deliver to the Lender a copy of a final, definitive, and executed term sheet, commitment, letter of intent, offer, or other written expression of interest (\u201cPreliminary Transaction Document\u201d) evidencing a binding commitment for one or more transactions that, collectively, would constitute a Repayment Transaction, which Preliminary Transaction Document(s) shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default (other than the Specified Defaults), or the expiration or termination of the forbearance period under the Forbearance Agreement, KeyBank may declare the entire unpaid principal balance, together with all accrued interest and other amounts payable to KeyBank thereunder, immediately due and payable.\nOn the Termination Date, the KeyBank will have, and may exercise, any and all of its rights and remedies set forth herein or in any Loan Document, at law, or in equity. Conditioned only on the occurrence of the Termination Date, KeyBank will be entitled to, and the Loan Parties consent to, the appointment of a state or federal court receiver with respect to any or all of the Loan Parties (excluding Mr. Deng) and/or any or all of the Collateral with notice to the Loan Parties, and the Loan Parties shall not oppose or otherwise interfere with such a receiver or the Lender\u2019s ability to obtain the appointment of such a receiver.\nThe Company does not know which rights and remedies, if any, KeyBank may choose to exercise under the Loan Documents upon the occurrence of an event of default (other than the Specified Defaults) or the expiration or termination of the forbearance period under the Forbearance Agreement. If KeyBank elects to foreclose on significant assets of the Company, then it will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, and the Company\u2019s ability to continue operations will be materially jeopardized.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with the requirements in the Loan Documents, including the Forbearance Agreement, or otherwise modify the requirements thereof. Such compliance depends, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain the cooperation of outside parties, which is not within the Company\u2019s control. If KeyBank were to exercise its default-related rights and remedies, then it will have a material adverse consequence on the Company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations arising within the next twelve months, and create substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to the Restructure\nOn June 7, 2019, we entered into an Exchange Agreement with Xiaotai and the Xiaotai Sellers, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, we will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Xiaotai from the Xiaotai Sellers. On June 7, 2019, we and NYM entered into a Purchase Agreement with Go Fresh, solely owned by Mr. Long Deng, IFMK\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. The Purchase Agreement provides for the sale of 100% of the equity interest in NYM to GO Fresh for cash consideration of $9.1 million. The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are a condition to the closing of the Acquisition and would take place contemporaneously with the closing of the Acquisition. Risks related to the Restructure include:\nSubsequent to the consummation of the Restructure, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough we have conducted due diligence on Xiaotai, we cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in Xiaotai\u2019s business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of our and Xiaotai\u2019s control will not later arise. As a result, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the Company or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe will have limited protection in the event that any of the representations and warranties made by Sellers or Xiaotai in the Exchange Agreement ultimately proves to be inaccurate or incorrect.\nIFMK and its shareholders will have limited protection if any representation or warranty made by Sellers or Xiaotai in the Exchange Agreement proves to be inaccurate or incorrect. Accordingly, to the extent such representations or warranties are incorrect, IFMK would have limited indemnification claims with respect thereto and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may waive one or more of the conditions to the Acquisition.\nWe may agree to waive, in whole or in part, some of the conditions to our obligations to complete the Acquisition, to the extent permitted by our charter and applicable laws. For example, it is a condition of our obligation to close the Acquisition and that Xiaotai\u2019s representations and warranties are true and correct in all respects as of the closing date, except for such inaccuracies that, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Exchange Agreement). However, if the Board determines that it is in the shareholders\u2019 best interest to waive any such breach, then the board may elect to waive that condition and close the Acquisition.\nOur ability to successfully effect the Restructure and successfully operate the business thereafter will be largely dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel, including certain executive officers of IFMK and the key personnel of Xiaotai, all of whom we expect to join IFMK following the Acquisition. The loss of such key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of the post-combination business.\nOur ability to successfully effect the Acquisition and successfully operate the business is dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel including Mr. Long Deng, the Chief Executive Officer of IFMK and Mr. Long Yi, the Chief Financial Officer of IFMK and key personnel of Xiaotai. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could adversely impact our ability to complete the Restructure.\nA market for our common stock may not continue after the restructure, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our common stock.\nFollowing the Restructure, as well as the anticipated concurrent reverse split, the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Restructure and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our common stock following the Restructure may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our common stock after the Restructure can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports. Additionally, if our common stock is not listed on, or become delisted from, the NASDAQ for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange), the liquidity and price of our common stock may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on the NASDAQ or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your common stock unless a market can be established or sustained.\nAlthough we expect that our common stock will remain listed on the NASDAQ after the Restructure, there can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to be so listed or, if listed, that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the NASDAQ.\nWe intend to apply for the continued listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ subsequent to the closing of the Restructure. To continue listing our common stock on the NASDAQ subsequent to the closing of the Restructure, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s initial listing standards, which are more rigorous than NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, including that our common stock trade at a minimum of $4.00 per common stock unless we qualify the $3.00 closing price alternative requirement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing standards at that time.\nIf, after the Restructure, the NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange due to our failure to meet the NASDAQ\u2019s initial and/or continued listing standards, we and our shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our ordinary shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our ordinary shares;\n\u25cf a limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf the Restructure benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, shareholders or financial analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.\nIf the benefits of the Restructure do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock prior to the closing of the Restructure may decline. The market values of our securities at the time of the Restructure may vary significantly from their prices on the date the Exchange Agreement and the Purchase Agreement were executed, or the date on which our shareholders vote on the Restructure.\nIn addition, following the Restructure, fluctuations in the price of our common stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Prior to the Restructure, there has not been a public market for Xiaotai\u2019s securities. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to Xiaotai and our common stock in the Restructure may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the Restructure. If an active market for our common stock develops and continues, the trading price of our common stock following the Restructure could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our common stock and our common stock may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of our common stock may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and the NASDAQ in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the Company could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nFollowing the Restructure, the Company\u2019s business and share prices may suffer as a result of its lack of public company operating experience of new management. Furthermore, if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our ordinary shares adversely, the price and trading volume of our ordinary shares could decline.\nPrior to the completion of the Restructure, Xiaotai has been a privately-held company. Most members of Xiaotai\u2019s management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. The management team may not successfully or efficiently manage Xiaotai\u2019s transition to be a division of a public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from Xiaotai\u2019s senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of Xiaotai\u2019s business, which could harm Xiaotai\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe obligation to disclose information publicly may put Xiaotai at a disadvantage to competitors that are private companies.\nUpon completion of this acquisition, Xiaotai will become a member of a consolidated group of a publicly listed company in the United States. Xiaotai will need to disclose occurrence of matters that are material to the reporting company and its shareholders that Xiaotai would not be required to disclose if Xiaotai were a private company. Xiaotai\u2019s competitors may have access to this information, which would otherwise be confidential. This may give them advantages in competing with Xiaotai. To the extent compliance with U.S. laws increases expenses or decreases Xiaotai\u2019s competitiveness against such companies, the public listing could affect Xiaotai\u2019s results of operations.\nXiaotai will incur additional costs as a result of becoming a subsidiary of a public company, which could negatively impact its net income and liquidity.\nUpon completion of this acquisition, Xiaotai will become a subsidiary of a public company in the United States. As a result, Xiaotai will incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that Xiaotai did not incur as a private company. Xiaotai expects that the rules and regulations will increase its legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and will make many corporate activities more time-consuming and costly. If Xiaotai fails to comply with these rules and regulations, Xiaotai could become the subject of a governmental enforcement action, investors may lose confidence in its public parent company and the share price could suffer.\nThe transition to becoming a division of a public company will require changes in the way Xiaotai operates its business.\nPrivate companies often have less regulated methods of operation than public companies. This results in less transparency and presents greater risks of noncompliance with rules and regulations. In anticipation of the proposed transaction, Xiaotai management has begun to implement a variety of measures to ensure that the company follows the rules applicable to public companies in the United States. To the extent these new procedures and policies could not change historical behaviors that might be inconsistent with the rules regulating U.S. public company, Xiaotai could be at risk of violation or poor reporting as a public company following this transaction.\nCompletion of the Reverse Split and the Restructure is subject to a number of conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, such transactions will not be completed.\nIFMK\u2019s obligation and the obligation of Xiaotai to complete the Acquisition are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others:\n\u25cf approval and completion of the Reverse Split\u037e\n\u25cf approval of the Acquisition by IFMK\u2019s stockholders\u037e\n\u25cf unconditional written consent from KeyBank simultaneously with consummation of the transaction contemplated in the Exchange Agreement\u037e\n\u25cf satisfaction of all the conditions to the obligations of each party to consummate the Spin-off described in the Purchase Agreement;\n\u25cf receipt of opinions of counsel\u037e\n\u25cf absence of injunctions or certain legal impediments\u037e\n\u25cf approval for the listing on NASDAQ of the shares of Xiaotai\u2019s common stock to be issued in the Acquisition\u037e and\n\u25cf accuracy of the representations and warranties with respect to each of the foregoing transactions, subject to certain materiality thresholds\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the Exchange Agreement will be satisfied or waived or that the Acquisition itself will be completed.\nIFMK\u2019s obligation and the obligation of Go Fresh to complete the Spin-off are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others:\n\u25cf the approval of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Spin-off) by a majority of votes cast by our shareholders that are present in person or by proxy at our special meeting;\n\u25cf the receipt of any other required Board, governmental and regulatory approvals and consents;\n\u25cf the receipt of any other required third person approvals in order to consummate the Spin-off;\n\u25cf there is no applicable law or order in effect which makes illegal or prevents or prohibits the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and there is no pending third party non-Affiliate legal proceeding to enjoin or otherwise restrict the closing;\n\u25cf all of the conditions to the obligations of each party to consummate the Acquisition described in the Exchange Agreement shall have been satisfied;\n\u25cf the written consent of KeyBank to the Spin-Off;\n\u25cf No pending action shall have been brought by third parties to enjoin or otherwise restrict the consummation of the closing.\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the Purchase Agreement will be satisfied or waived or that the Spin-off itself will be completed.\nNASDAQ may not list or continue to list our shares and the Exchange Shares on its exchange, which could prevent consummation of the Acquisition or could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities. Consequently, we may be subject to additional trading restrictions.\nIFMK intends to apply to have the Exchange Shares listed on NASDAQ in connection with consummation of the Acquisition, and it is a closing condition of the Acquisition that our shares continue to be listed on NASDAQ. The post-Acquisition entity will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to be listed. We may not be able to meet those initial listing requirements. Even if our securities are so listed, we may be unable to maintain the listing of our securities in the future. If we fail to meet the initial listing requirements and NASDAQ does not list our securities on its exchange, neither IFMK nor Xiaotai would be required to consummate the Acquisition. In the event that each of IFMK and Xiaotai elected to waive this condition, IFMK and its stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for its securities\u037e\n\u25cf a limited amount of news coverage for the company\u037e and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nFailure to complete the Restructure could negatively impact IFMK\u2019s stock price, future business or operations.\nIf the Restructure is not completed, IFMK, Xiaotai and Go Fresh may be subject to a number of material risks, including the following:\n\u25cf IFMK may be required under certain circumstances to pay Xiaotai a termination fee\u037e\n\u25cf the price of IFMK\u2019s common stock may decline to the extent that the relevant current market price reflects a market assumption that the Acquisition will be completed\u037e\n\u25cf IFMK may not have sufficient working capital to fund its operation on an ongoing basis\u037e\n\u25cf IFMK may not have sufficient time to regain compliance under NASDAQ continued Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) in order to avoid being delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market\u037e and\n\u25cf costs related to the Restructure, such as legal, accounting, certain financial advisory and financial printing fees, must be paid even if the Restructure is not completed.\nFurthermore, if the Restructure is terminated and either company\u2019s board of directors determines to seek another Restructure or business combination, there can be no assurance that it will be able to find a partner on terms as attractive as those provided for in the Exchange Agreement and the Purchase Agreement. In addition, while the Exchange Agreement and the Purchase Agreement are in effect and subject to very narrowly defined exceptions, IFMK is prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other business combination (except with Xiaotai and Go Fresh).\nThe exercise of IFMK\u2019s directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the terms of Acquisition may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes to the terms of the Acquisition or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in IFMK\u2019s stockholders\u2019 best interest.\nIn the period leading up to the closing of the Acquisition, events may occur that, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, would require IFMK to agree to amend the Exchange Agreement, to consent to certain actions taken by Xiaotai or to waive rights that IFMK is entitled to under the Exchange Agreement. Such events could arise because of changes in the course of Xiaotai\u2019s business, a request by Xiaotai to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the Exchange Agreement or the occurrence of other events that would have a material adverse effect on Xiaotai\u2019s business. In any of such circumstances, it would be at IFMK\u2019s discretion, acting through its board of directors, to grant its consent or waive those rights. The existence of the financial and personal interests of the directors of IFMK described in the preceding risk factors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors between what he or they may believe is best for IFMK and its stockholders and what he or they may believe is best for himself or themselves in determining whether or not to take the requested action.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, IFMK does not believe there will be any changes or waivers that IFMK\u2019s directors and officers would be likely to make after stockholder approval of the Acquisition Proposal has been obtained. While certain changes could be made without further stockholder approval, IFMK will circulate a new or amended proxy statement and resolicit IFMK\u2019s stockholders if changes to the terms of the transaction that would have a material impact on its stockholders are required prior to the vote on the Acquisition Proposal.\nThe post-Restructure Company may not realize anticipated growth opportunities.\nXiaotai expects that it will realize growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the Restructure. Xiaotai cannot predict with certainty if or when these growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved. For example, the benefits from the Restructure may be offset by costs incurred in obtaining or attempting to obtain regulatory approvals for the Restructure, or as a result of being a public company.\nThe Company, Xiaotai and Go Fresh will incur significant transaction-related costs in connection with the Restructure.\nThe Company, Xiaotai and Go Fresh expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the Restructure before, at, and after closing the Restructure. The Company, Xiaotai and Go Fresh will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing post-Restructure plans, including facility and system implementation costs and employment-related costs. The Company, Xiaotai and Go Fresh will continue to assess the magnitude of these costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Restructure and Xiaotai, in particular, will assess these costs in relation to post-Restructure activities.\nUpon consummation of the Restructure, Mr. Baofeng Pan, will beneficially own approximately 53.2% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock and exert significant influence on our operations.\nUpon the consummation of the Restructure, Mr. Baofeng Pan, our chairman and director upon closing of the Restructure, will own approximately 53.2% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Pan, by virtue of his beneficial ownership of these shares, will be able to exercise substantial influence over our operations upon completion of the Restructure. He may have significant influence over election of directors and other matters requiring shareholder approval. Such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other business combination, which may, in turn, have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their stock.\nMr. Baofeng Pan, as the principal shareholders of the post-Restructure Company, have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may adversely affect our business.\nBaofeng Pan, our Chairman and Director upon closing of the Restructure, is a significant shareholder of Xiaotai, one of the VIE entities from which the majority of our revenue is expected upon closing of the Restructure. Conflicts of interests between his duty to our Company and Xiaotai may arise. For example, Mr. Pan could cause Xiaotai to fail to take actions that are in the best interests of our Company. As Ms. Pan will be also CEO, Chairman and Director of our Company, he has duties of loyalty and care to us under Delaware law when there are any potential conflicts of interests between our company and Xiaotai. We cannot assure you, however, that if conflicts of interest arise, he will act completely in our interests or that conflicts of interests will be resolved in our favor. In addition, Mr. Pan could violate his employment agreement with us or his legal duties by diverting business opportunities from us to others. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest between us and Mr. Pan, as applicable, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in the disruption of our business.\nWe will have limited protection in the event that any of the representations and warranties made by Go Fresh in the Purchase Agreement ultimately proves to be inaccurate or incorrect.\nIFMK and its shareholders will have limited protection if any representation or warranty made by Go Fresh in the Purchase Agreement proves to be inaccurate or incorrect. Accordingly, to the extent such representations or warranties are incorrect, IFMK would have limited indemnification claims with respect thereto and its financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may waive one or more of the conditions to the Spin-off.\nWe may agree to waive, in whole or in part, some of the conditions to our obligations to complete the Spin-off, to the extent permitted by our charter and applicable laws. For example, it is a condition of our obligation to complete the Spin-off and that Go Fresh\u2019s representations and warranties are true and correct in all respects as of the closing date. However, if the Board determines that it is in the shareholders\u2019 best interest to waive any such breach, then the board may elect to waive that condition and complete the Spin-off.\nWe might have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third-parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with Go Fresh.\nOur agreements with Go Fresh related to the Spin-off, including the Purchase Agreement, were negotiated with Go Fresh in the context of our anticipated separation from NYM Holdings Inc. and the subsequent acquisition of Xiaotai. Although the agreement is intended to be on an arm\u2019s-length basis, it may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations among unaffiliated third-parties. The terms of the agreement being negotiated in the context of our separation concern, among other things, allocations of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations among Go Fresh and us.", "PERMNO": 16590, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "IFMK"}
